         There is a song...which my A.D.D.-ridden brain is trying to learn right now. This song is called...    THE SPINNING SONG    And it is a  guitar   piano  song...and it's incredibly hard, and I don't care what anyone says, not even my loser girlfriend :)  Ok, so I can get both parts down pat. I just can't do the song all together because I'm not that coordinated/patient. Most songs I play that are complicated (i.e.:  Blackened ) require more fretboard work than actual picking. And that is really gay. Pianos are bigoted to right-handed people and that is so uncool...Abby's just  really  special, that's all. Whereas I have been playing for the last thirty minutes, getting absolutely nowhere...but I did wake up this morning and remember, as a matter of fact, how to play  Blackened  from a few years ago, when I was heavily into Metallica's  ...And Justice For All . I just stood up, checked the message, read some more Harry Potter (which I finished....what a sad and miserable ending...), and then stood up to find     ALL OF MY GEAR IN PERFECT SHAPE, SOMEHOW...     it fixed itself...and so I played  Blackened  at a much higher level than I should've, along with the solos to  Master of Puppets ,  Sanitarium  (and a bit of the song with it),  My Friend of Misery ,  ...And Justice For All , and some others.  Music makes me too excited. I really should go take Aterol...o wait...I only have A.D.D. when I need to, thus: no pills.  Damn me.
