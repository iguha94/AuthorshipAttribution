         Here's some sad news:  I'm leaving for Florida tomorrow and it's cloudy out there, and those clouds are probably going to chase us Charlie Brown-style to Florida, whereafter we will be rained with The Second Biblical Flood and never allow'd by nature to hit the beach. And it will really screw with my plans too, considering they consist of: wake up, take a shower, jump off the balcony and onto the beach for twenty or so hours, go back inside, sleep, start it all over again. For the next  week , by god, I  love  Florida; I should ask my mom to move down here to some obscure beach town, since she's always threatening to go to some secluded town in the midst of nowhere. Why not have a beach while we're at it?  Sorry for the "beach bum fever" the past few days, just incredibly excited to be going somewhere nice for spring. If I recall last year was spent in my dad's house, where I enjoyed an exciting week of rain and surfing the Internet. On the sunny days I was given the perogative to sit outside and read all day. It  has  occurred to me that there is no difference between that and this year's schedule; it's just that this year has a big fucking blue expanse of water stuck in the middle there.   Bon vacances to all you Antiphilanthropists, and a big wet sob to those in MLK and Warton having to go back while I langour in an endless bask for the next week, to all of Davidson for that matter.  .értaL
