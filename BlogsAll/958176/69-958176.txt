         Heh, well yeah, you could come if I was still having it. Not this weekend, I wanted to try and get sometime where I can get everyone at the same time. On a side note, why do you keep thinking I hate so you so much?   Where do I pull the lyrics from? As in, how do I write them or where do I get the inspiration for them?...although that is virtually the same question. Or do you mean, where would you find them...although that isn't the question, now is it? The lyrics to all of my  recorded  songs are on this page somewhere, in case that, in fact,  is  the query.  Inspiration is a very tricky thing. It's about taking pieces of negative and positive sentiments and putting them on paper. It's taking what I see and making words meld with it, and at times, it's very hard. Any lyricist will tell you, writing good lyrics isn't about thinking about the words involved, it's about getting a message across. If you're good enough, you'll know what words to use, you just need to figure out where to put them; it's hard tho, because it makes me focus on things I'd rather not think about most of the time...it's about depression and anger for nearly 75 percent of them, and the other 25 is about being ignorant so as to prevent hurting myself ( Close My Eyes ), letting go of something, learning something through pain ( Hollow feats make a man of the meek ) and the occasional death anthem a la Metallica, although it's been about three years since I wrote one of those.
