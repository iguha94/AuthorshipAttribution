         Whee everyone, whee.  Well I have been explained the Herd. Sweet. I figured it was something along those lines.  To summarize the day after I got home...  Alex called and him and Steven came over, whereafter we pulled sticks from a fallen tree in our yard and battled. I took a few hits to the legs but I gave the point to Alex and Steven a few times. Then Alex lost the keys to his truck and we spent an hour looking for them in the freezing cold. After a while he found  a  key but not  the  key...he left, and after that I grabbed a flashlight and hunted for another half hour or so, but no avail.   And then I got home and started watching  Lord of the Rings , because I had wanted to all week, and drinking Vanilla Coke and stuff.  And NOW I am updating, because I haven't even posted in my own BLog in the past thousand days. At least here I have a computer that works and all.  Sick, Z? I had to play Speed with Will today in 5th, I got my  ass  kicked. It sucked a lot. Becca was in a really bad mood today and I tried to cheer her up the best I could. I know those kinds of days that she was talking about, I heard the same words I had said 1000 times in the past, "I just want to disappear", although in her case it was for the next few hours or so. She presses herself  way  too hard, I think. I hope she'll be ok.  I hope Rosie is having fun at the S&M party with five of her alleged six boyfriends, and I hope Bob isn't bleeding too bad. Heh.  What is this I feel...tired? Must I resign now? I feel to die of shame for this atrocity. AGH. I just had Vanilla Coke, this isn't fair. Especially even after I got some extra sleep this morning and everything. DAMN. I'll just do something to entertain myself for now.  Like rest my eyes.  I'll certainly be back.
