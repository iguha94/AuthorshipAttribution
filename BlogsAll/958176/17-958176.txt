          Down in a Hole  by Alice in Chains  Bury me softly in this world I give this part of me to you The sand rains down and here I sit Holding rare flowers in a tomb In bloom  Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be safe See my heart I've decorated like a grave You don't understand what they thought I was supposed to be Look at me now, I'm a man who won't let himself be  Down in a hole Feeling so small Down in a hole Losing my soul I'd like to fly But my wings have been so denied  Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth I will breathe no more of my feelings beneath  Down in a hole Feeling so small Down in a hole Losing my soul I'd like to fly But my wings have been so denied  Bury me softly in this world (Oh I wanna be inside of you) I give this part of me for you (Oh I wanna be inside of you The sand rains down and here I sit (Oh I wanna be inside of you) Holding rare flowers in a tomb (Oh I wanna be inside)  Down in a hole Feeling so small Down in a hole Losing my soul Down in a hole Losing my soul Down in a hole Out of control I'd like to fly But my wings have been so denied  Wanted to post this one since it's really harmonic on Layne's part, and I had it stuck in my head about three seconds ago.
