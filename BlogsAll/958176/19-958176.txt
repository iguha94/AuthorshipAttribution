         Today is going to suck, but that's ok because I'm in a good mood.  No sleep, for one. Another, I have a test in Euro today, and I didn't do any of the homework. But that's ok. I listened to the  Sacred Song  with Kenzie a few times, then I talked to Leigh Anne, and Alex got in there eventually, and we listened to some Metallica ( The Call of ...well...you know), then I went to sleep (on the phone of course), woke up this morning, felt really sick, went to my grandma's, forgot to take vitamin C, but I did have these chocolate Ritz crackers that were awesome.  Last night I played  My Solution  about five times, trying to get it perfect and sing along with it. Why, because we're going for the talent show, and yes, we have a prospective bassist now...Alex wants me to play lead but I'm sure we could find a lead guitarist sooner than the day, which is early March. We have some time. For now though, we have to get some practice, haven't had a session since forever.   I nailed  Solution  by the way. It sounds soooooooo cool, I got some new distortion and a new way of singing the last choruses. Now if Alex can exactly replicate the recorded version when we rerecord/play it live, it's going to be the greatest song ever...plus a new song in place of the second song,  Deadgone , this one's prototype name is  Rage , since  Deadgone  didn't really have much substance, and  Rage  is completely finished. I wrote most of it in 7th grade for a project, and now I've finished it and embellished on it. Nice catchy screaming now. And I got the lyrics done to  All Fall Down .  This is gonna be the weirdest album ever.   If  ever.  I don't have a phone at my dad's anymore by the way, dumb bastard cancelled it to "get his debts under control", so I've got my cellphone...if anybody needs me I'll be there.  And here I am typing and I need to go do Euro.  What a fuckup I art.
