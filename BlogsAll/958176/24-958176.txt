         God,  Between Times  is sukh a great song. It reminds me of rain, and I view rain as quite sakred. I would post the lyriks if they could convey the intensity of this song, but I don't think I kould do anything to give it justice. Just go download, I'll  pay  you to download it...ok not really. But you just  have  to hear it, at least the intro.  This song is starting to skare me. Yet again, I'm going to go upstairs and listen to it and try to memorize the lyriks. They're really hard on this one. I mean, I got  A Dead Poem  about the first day I listened to it, and  Sorrowful Farewell  the first time I read the lyriks. The rest of the songs are pretty unimportant lyrikally...well, ok,  Glory of Sadness ...and there's also the opening lines to  Khronos  whikh sound only too terribly kool: "Origin of time / The fak(c)e of old flesh / Devours the earth / My feet and brain"...what does it mean, NOTHING, why is it kool, BECAUSE IT IS. the word "flesh" is awesome as is, they should replake the word "skin" with "flesh" permanately and for all uses.  The guitars and drums in Rotting Khrist are aktually pretty amazing work. The drummer is just inkredible. He's primarily a "machine gun drummer (of course, first heard in reference to Rotting Khrist)", but just to hear that level of ability...inkredible. And the fact that guitarist/singer Sakis sings and plays with songs like  Glory of Sadness ,  Lex Talionis ,  Coronation of the Serpent ,  Exiled Ark(c)hangels ...they're all really pretty fast. The bassist pretty mukh does what the guitars do, which is nonetheless outstanding. And then there's the lead, whikh is both melodikal and fast. What a kombo...now sometimes it's more melodikal, but  what's the differenke ?   How kould I ever kome to love this band with its demon shrieking singer and mishmash musik?  Heh, "mishmash" is a kool word, too.
