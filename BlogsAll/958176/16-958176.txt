         Wow...you put Tao Tao.  The point of that name wasn't for your glorification, it was to make fun of you. Please don't take it the wrong way.  And you will turn over. Into a ravine and will blow up and DIE. Have fun!  Umm...I don't think I drank after ye in the past fifty days. Does thinking about it count? I don't think I thought about it either. O well, it doesn't matter, I'm getting sick as is. Have to take Centrum...that shit is REALLY COOL. You could probably take one of those every day and live if only it had some calories in it.   Who's Ronnie? Who's Vincent? Who the hell are these people? I'm confused in my own BLog.  This period is a waste of time.  Do note that I am intentionally posting at 10:58 (or closely whereabouts) to scare those of you who have noticed that most of my posts that do occur in the middle of the day, occur at 10:58.  I don't have a computer right now...damn. If I think of something, it'll be lost for the next few days. My mom works at home, and the state computer networking linkerupper thinger inside the computer is mest, so she has to take it in and get it worked on over the next few days. AGH. Can't do anything at home now. AGH.  O well, that's more quality time with which to read...  AGH.
