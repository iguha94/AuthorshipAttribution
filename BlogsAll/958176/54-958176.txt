         Begrudgingly, it's just one of those forgetful days.  I had something I wanted to type in here, but I forgot it. Of course it wasn't important, but still.  I'm working on a story for Elftown. I figure since I'm taking up space with my presence there, I might as well contribute a little, with the best thing I know how to do in the way of art...writing. It was a pretty crazy idea, but I came up with it in the shower this morning (as I do with all crazy ideas). To write the history of man through the eyes of God. Of course, God is a cynic and thinks all human ideas and religions have completely lost it. He toys with his power, he explains the concept of creation and reason for the world's greatest disasters: the Flood, the Black Plague, the Holocaust, and so on, he explains his own creation and the creation of the universe in the best way he knows how...which is, of course, not at all.   It won't be very long. Mostly, it will show coincidences between the plane of God and the mortal realm, and why God think about things the way he does. You might be thinking, "This is probably some staidly religious story, isn't it?" Let me assure you, if God isn't the way he is in this story, and more in the biblical vein of God, I'm going to fry forever. But it's a great idea, I think. Who'd have ever though of the story of the world from the vantage point of the one who made it...slightly twisting commonly accepted ideals about God, however that may be.  This might take a little longer than I thought, though. It's sort of hard to make God sound assured of his power without being overly cocky. I just need to make him sound like he  knows  he is badass, because he is.   And trust in this, it's hard to do it without lapsing into a few lines of God's laughing uproariously at humanity, because it sounds like he's on the verge of it in this story most of the time.
