         For fun, I never responded to it and it was an interesting thread. And I was really bored and lonely in the library that day.  Well antiphilanthropists, well......  It's all coming to a head. If you read my post in "The Blog" yesterday (which is probably when you'll be reading this), then you'll know what I'm talking about in this post. I really need to stress the pointlessness in having this get-together this weekend.  Let me put it this way, and I'm sure everyone can agree. If you thought for one minute that I would ever agree with someone else's opinion that wasn't entirely like mine when it came to this matter, you are wrong, dead wrong. If I had to pick a solution to this problem, I would take plan number one (mentioned by Lindsey), because if Rosie and Becca have some time to cool their jets they might actually be those adults we're wanting them to be and this situation will close like a storybook. If we let them have at it and try to interject, someone is going to say something they might regret, and it might just cause not only Rosie and Becca to fall apart, but the rest of us as well.   If you're really planning to follow through on this, please remember: one, try to keep your head; two, I am behind those of you who would do as such one hundred thousand percent, and will certainly be there when it happens; and three, no matter what I say, and no matter what is said to me, each and every one of you will still be some of the best friends I have ever had; I'm not quite sure anyone realizes what an impact each of you have made on what I've become, and GOD forbid I'd ever forget that.  And now that the sentimentality is over, we await the bomb to go off, watching the timer as it clicks down to total oblivion...or maybe the fuse is faulty; but in the end, only time will tell.  Just like everything else, only time will tell.
