         Rotting Christ once said, "It took an instant; the struggle was sharp...I remember what you had said: the challenger will prevail,"  And so it is true, in a many of ways, 'tis true. And  why  is this?  SECOND PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SECOND PLACE MEANS  VICTORY !!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND NOW...................  State, and this time, we have plenty of time to work on it. Today was a sweep for us, considering the amount of effort prior and our total improv times before...we actually ran  over  the time limit. But it didn't matter, we still beat out Centennial even if they did finish. Which means we can clean up at state with some work.  At first I had thought we were counted down on teamwork because of my showoffishness...then I remembered Franklin's "Harp Girl", who did almost the same thing. So I guess it was simply that we were first, and set as a standard against the rest. That definitely contributed to our downfall...well, perhaps that's too strong of a word. With our work, we could've had first.  I must say, "GO TEAM!", we were fraggin' GREAT compared to the beginning, where we figured we were going to be slaughtered and abdicated from a mere shot at state. So we won by default, we still got  second  and went  first .  So...Sarah, Will, Elizabeth, Rosie, even Lindsey for the first practice, and me too!,  HURRAH! CONGRATULATIONS!
