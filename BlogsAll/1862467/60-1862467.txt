           Dean for America: Home : "Congressman Jesse L. Jackson, Jr. Praises Dean on Bringing Economic Agenda to the South  November 1, 2003 Congressman Jesse L. Jackson, Jr., today said, 'This year we celebrated the 40th anniversary of Dr. King's famous speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963. Forty years later, Dr. Howard Dean is reminding us that the great task of uniting the northern black and white urban poor and working class, with the southern black and white rural poor and working class around common economic issues good health care, high quality schools, and affordable housing is the key to wrestling our democracy away from the race-oriented Republican right-wing. . .  'Normally, rather than directly confronting poor and working class white southerners with a strong economic agenda, Democrats have tried to imitate Republicans on many of these social issues. It is good that we have a candidate offering hope to the South with an economic agenda. It is Dr. Dean who is reminding us that the combination of poor and working class blacks and whites, north and south, united in coalition around a common economic agenda of jobs, health care, education and housing will constitute a winning strategy in 2004,' concluded Cong. Jackson."      Look at the graph at the bottom of this page . 13% of Dean's donors gave gifts over $200. The numbers for Kerry, Gephardt, and Edwards are 53%, 56%, and 67% respectively. For Bush, it's 74%. Dean is definitely the working man's candidate.
