         Welcome home everyone, hope your holiday was restful and filling. I never did find service in Taos, but I wrote a few blog entries, so I'll be p-blogging the week sometime soon.   It was a funny experience, to be without a connection all week. Other issues kept me from writing much at all, and so my computer and I took a brief separation. I can't share in the usual comments on separations of this nature--you know, the cleansing feeling of disconnection from technology, or the relishing of time to my brain alone without a keyboard to interpret it--rather, I felt jumbled and not quite mentally clear until I was back to writing regularly. What a full week in the news, too! And I had to experience it all through newspapers (the paper kind), CNN, and my rather conservative relative.   When I did write, I knew if I blogged it wouldn't go up live, and to be honest, that took a bit of the magic away for me. I don't exactly have a huge audience following, but I do have regulars and I worried what they would think of my long unexplained absense. Today I checked my sitemeter to find my average dropped, understandable, but my google page rank must have increased because I'm getting a lot more hits off google searches. I feel kind of bad about that because I don't think these people are finding what they seek, but maybe they'll stick around as fans.
