         Am I the only one who thinks the feds in DC are a bunch of sissies for   shutting down  today? This is the first time the entire federal government has ever shut down for a hurricane and the storm hit far south of the city! If the storm was still a cat. 5 or even a 4 as it approached, maybe I would be more understanding of the caution. But as it is, I'm just not feeling the love.  Guardan has an interesting article on their blogging experiment and on the effects of blogs on the recent WTO events.  My first blogger.com friend, Brent, had this   link  on   his site . I know goofballs always abound on both sides of a polarized issue, but right wing Christians seem to consistently take the cake in this country. Be sure to scroll down to the Mac story.   The ongoing issue of the colon stuff has now come to the point where I am seeking out a virtual colonoscopy. In Houston, I have only found two places that do this:   Vital Imaging  and   Memorial Herman Wellness Center . The costs to me are $950 and $600, respectively.   This is one search tool  I came across. MD Anderson's newsletter had this   article on how to talk to your doctor  that is specifically about colon cancer patients, but applicable to any kind of appointment. I'm glad to see doctors and hospitals encouraging patients to come in prepared with their own research, even from the internet. Not too long ago that was an annoyance.
