         I'm laying on the couch watching Bravo's West Wing daytime re-runs (It's the Throw an Elbow episode, didn't you love that one? What a pleasure to get to watch it again). My back went out this morning as I leaned over to put the kids in their carseats. Believe it or not, this problem actually originated yesterday when I had a spike in creativity. For the past week I've been pressing myslef to complete some pieces so I can send them to my cousin who has graciously accepted the job of editor. She's an actual professional editor, but she's living in France w/o a work Visa at the moment and is a little low on work. So yesterday the muses finally hit me over the head with their magic finishing wands and I hit it hard. I wrote and wrote and wrote. The words were coming so fast that I had to improve my typing posture so that I could lift my palms from the keyboard and type faster, and that's what did it. My arms connect to my backbone in muscles that intersect and sinew their crafty selves just under my rib cage. And that's the spot that stopped working and started spasming this morning. This is especially bad because I need those muscles to carry around my baby daughter.  And so I find myself laying nealry flat on the couch with my laptop on my hips, blogging along as I research remedies for back pain.   So far I've found   this . I don't know if it'll cure my own back pain, but maybe it can treat my husband's otherwise incurrable bad posture. Worth a try, don't you think? I'm trying to focus on loving the muscles, encouraging them to heal themselves, align or stop spasming, or whatever it is they need. But man, did they pick a bad time to freak out. One week later and I'll be coolin' it in the high desert of the most beautiful state in the nation... but no. Stupid back. No, no, I love you back, please stop hurting me...
