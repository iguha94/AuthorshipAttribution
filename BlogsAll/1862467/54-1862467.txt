         wow, driving around Houston this morning was a trip! Cars were scattered everywhere like carnage from left behind (who would have guessed I'd have cause to reference that tripe two days running?). They must have flooded out in the streets, then tossed around in the water. This morning, with the water receded, it all just looks surreal. The bayous are still up street to street, but at least not over the street in most places. Where they did go over the streets, mud bars now scar across the lanes.   If you read my post from last night, you know how overplayed I thought the whole flood was, but the scenes today are enough to inspire me to retract. The traffic was crazy on every street this morning, and I couldn't figure out why, then I realized that I10 must still be flooded, or too littered with flooded out cars to be passable. It was an absolute river yesterday. But the important thing is how bright and clear the sky is. Yesterday, as all this rain started to move in, I remember thinking how pretty and vibrant the colors all seemed. Wet and sleek, bright against the gray of rain and clouds. Stoplights, headlights, crossing guard lights all captured my eye. And then I woke up and saw the sunlight this morning. Sun never looked so good!    UPDATE: I've discovered that after a natural disaster that attacked cars in the city whose blood runs black, Houston quickly begins to look like a real city. The busses were clogged, the sidewalks were busy, the bikelanes were downright crowded! Good old Mama Nature took a popshot at Tom DeLay!
