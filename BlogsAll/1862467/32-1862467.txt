         Tonight marks the opening of   November Sweeps , and to quote   E!Online , "You can title this November sweeps Milking Private Lynch." Apparently, CBS still   hasn't finished cutting scenes  from what has affectionately come to be called  Meet the Reagans. The previews were met with   advertisers threatening  a boycott and   abounding    editorials . My favorite so far is the   Salt Lake Tribune's article  called, and I shit you not, Liberals and Gays have Gone 1 Too Far with Miniseries that Crucifies Reagans. Freedom of Speech my ass. Freedom has become a puppet, and the strings are perpetually pulled by corporations.   Anyway, back to Sweeps, the casualties include Coupling, Boomtown, Brotherhood of Poland, NH (sorry, mom) and Lyon's Den. Big shock. As for daytime TV, I've been saying for some time that the most pleasant surprise of the season has been the Ellen Degeneres Show, so I hope it stays. And I hope the bloodbath on the soaps ends soon, I've never seen so many shows kill so many characters! For primetime, my money's on Average Joe, Trista's Wedding, Queer Eye, which will show on NBC in addition to its usual Bravo slot. I'm hopeful for Fox's new show,   Arrested Development . The plot looks clever, the writing is great on the outtakes I've seen, but the cast is littered with remnants of sitcoms past, which doesn't bode well. We'll see...
