         I'm embarrassed to say that I've fallen a little behind in my readings of some choice blogs. Today I began to catch up and was shocked to hear of   what happened recently to Salam Pax . It's official, we have become the evil that we most hate.   Every war (or military action) since World War II has used WWII as its justification. That's the one war we didn't run out of PR steam before the job was done, largely because of the liberation of the Jewish holocaust detainees. I bet those Jewish survivors are sick of having their experiences usurped for political wrongs. Anyway, this has gone past political wrongs to humanitarian wrongs. Maybe we've sunk to this depth before and I'm too young to remember, but I'm not now, and I refuse to be quiet. What will I tell my children when they study this in college, with the distance of history sufficient to allow historians to point out just how wrong and terrible the US was. Do I say we towed the line the government fed us? We were afraid to speak up while thousands upon thousands of innocent civilians were killed by American troops?   This knowledge that history will hold us accountable for our actions was my inspiration for protesting in Houston, Austin, Santa Fe, and Washington DC last year. I wrote all my congressional representatives, the [un-]president, the [un-] vice-president, and the governor of Texas to tell them the military actions against Afghanistan and Iraq were wrong. My words were like yelling in the wind, they did nothing to stop the killing. The only thing they did was give me some small pittance of a defense when my children and grandchildren learn about these injustices.
