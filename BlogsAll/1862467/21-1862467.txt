         Oh, that is so, so sweet. Amazing drama, amazing documentary. I've been   blogging about it on the Dean site . Here's what I wrote there: Remember when the Reagan book came out and people were so offended that the biographer inserted himself as a fictional character? This is the film version of that. I think execs everywhere watched the 2000 election and kicked themselves for not writing drama that good, then, after picking themselves off the floor from shock (as we all had to), they vowed to never be left out of this action again. That's what I think it was.  It's too crazy there to stick around so I'm moving my comments here. I'll add that last night John and I watched VH1's inside shows on Real World and Survivor. This was after catching Bravo's Reality of Reality off and on all week. John said these shows must effectively pop the paradigm bubble for the reality tv era, so what's next. We both looked starry-eyed for a minute, then made funny comments about if you knew the answer to that question you would be a rich entertainment exec. Well, tonight we saw what's next. This is amazing.  OK, I'm   posting  on the Dean blog again. People are starting to show up who didn't like it. Are they old? Are they nuts? I can't think of a scenario in which people who are the type of people who 1) support Dean and 2) blog wouldn't love K Street!
