           The Observer | International | Private Jessica says President is misusing her 'heroism'   You won't see this in the American sweeps frenzy. The closest I found tonight was PBS with the accounts of the many creative muzzles past administrations found for the press during war.   Let's quote from   the Observer : "Beneath the gloss of the US media and the machinations of an administration eager to show a 'good news' angle of the Iraq conflict against the reality of a rising body count, Lynch has become a metaphor not for the heroism of pretty young Americans captured by a devilish foreign enemy, but for the confusion that has marked Bush's Operation Iraqi Freedom from the start."  You think that's good, it gets better: "Lynch now questions why her rescue was filmed: 'They used me to symbolize all this stuff. It's wrong. I don't know why they filmed it, or why they say these things.'"   Any reader of my blog knows how bad   I knocked the milking of Private Lynch . I must now retract absolutely everything I said. Turns out she had hero blood in her veins after all! She has the guts to stand up, in the light of media-made heroism worthy of an Oscar for screenwriting, and say that emperor is naked. On one hand, it's a win/win for Jessica because even in the light of her yelling into the wind version of the story, which is ignored by all but that   crazy wacko    foreign press , she gets millions in book contracts and movie rights. But on the other hand,   the truth is out there ,   Mulder .
