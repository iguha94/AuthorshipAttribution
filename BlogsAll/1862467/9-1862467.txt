         I’m embarrassed that it’s taken this long for my permanent online presence. I’ve always been so proud that I was online relatively early in the game. For my generation that’s pretty rare. We’re too young to have been part of the building of the web and too old to have grown up with it. My very first anniem was assigned to me in the fall of my freshman year back in 1994!  Taos is really the best place for my e-coming out. After an extremely long six-week delay, I finally got my promised vacation to Northern New Mexico and it’s being polluted by the impending war. Nevertheless, we’re here and it’s great. The beautiful naken aspen, the crisp air, the sapphire blue skies, and the energy flowing from the mountains renew my soul.   Yesterday we went to the grocery store and I found myself pretending we lived here and this was just our mundane daily ritual. The community is very progressive. KTAO is a great radio station, on par with Radio Paradise. It’s the world’s first solar powered radio station. Today we went to World Cup, a fun coffee shop by the plaza, I got a coffee mug that says Resist Mediocrity.  Tomorrow we leave but this is where I grew up, and therefore where a part of me always lives. I knew if I was going to make this significant transition, it had to be here. When I was 13 I was staying at my aunt’s vacation home a few miles away in Angel Fire on New Years Eve when I started my first consistently held diary. I remember watching the torch-lit skiers glow down the slopes as I opened the book’s stiff, new pages. Now, years later, this is the continuing of that night. So while I’m sorry it’s been so long in the making, I’m very happy the blog was born here.
