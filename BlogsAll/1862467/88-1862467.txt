         is that humor? patriotism? what the hell! Before the Patriots/Colts game even began, it was a wash because as Leanne Rhymes sang the national anthem in the pre-game and wailed out rockets' red glare, fake rockets launched off the field, and as she sang bombs bursting in air, fake bombs blew up on field. Everyone cheered at this drama, but how sick is that! People we share this planet with are screaming right now, not in joy of anticipating the start of a football game, but in terror, real terror for fear of real rockets and bombs exploding around them.   In some cases, those bombs are eliciting the screams of American soldiers, and you'd think at least out of respect or acknowledgement of those actual screams, someone would have called this idea classless before it made it to the field. Just yesterday, such a bomb was laid in a road and claimed the lives that brought the death toll of American soldiers throughout Gulf II   notably over 500  (notable, because the Iraqi   civilian death toll    will soon reach 10,000 ). On the news, the fallen soldiers' friends and colleagues called this act cowardly. But in far more cases, those bombs were carelessly laid and dropped by us! that's right, the Americans use cowardly war tactics, too. They drop cluster bombs from the air that take the lives of the innocent indiscriminately, even though the indiscriminate taking of life is against the Geneva Convention. That's a terrorist tactic if I've ever heard of one.   We've met the enemy and he is us.
