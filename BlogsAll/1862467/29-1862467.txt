           Microsoft fired a worker  for noting a shipment he saw on the dock in his blog. This is bound to bite them in the ass. All Microsoft workers will feel betrayed by the company's proported stance on laying off bloggers.     Salon reported on "hackers"  (read bloggers and programmers) who have caught on to the Atkins rage. It's funny really to see the supergeeks doing something so normal as trying to lose weight. Anyway, it's a good bit of ethnography for the e-culture.  Assuming you got the daypass to read the aforementioned Salon article, stick around for the   King Kaufman NFL picks  for the weekend's games. He dissed my boys the Bears, but he'll pay. My family is in fresh Bear gear thanks to my parents recent Willowcreek conference, that's bound to be a goodluck charm, right? He won back my love a little becuase he picked Houston, but he made the pick his What the Heck pick, which is kind of a diss to Houston. I can't blame him for not picking the Steelers, but I sure hope they pull it out.   Here are two articles for my Houston readers:   one on Blade's , a new restaurant opening, and the other on   the Main Event , which will close Main for several blocks on Friday and Saturday nights for clubbers (a fantastic idea, I've been saying the Village should do this for a long time).
