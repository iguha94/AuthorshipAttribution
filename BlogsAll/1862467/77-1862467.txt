         The baby fell asleep for her morning nap, so I should get very busy now. I should be packing, wrapping, finishing the laundry. But instead I'm sitting on the couch blogging and watching MTV. Can you say procrastinate?  It started when I was watching the Sharon Osbourne Show while I nursed Ellie down. Jack's covering for his mum while she's in England with the injurred Ozzy. It's a brilliant idea, Jack is great. Unfortunately, instead of letting Jack really cover, interview guests, maybe even spoof mum's interview the hot guy in bed theme, they're just playing best of shots from past SOS shows. And since I'd made the official switch last month, the View just seems too yucky anymore to even watch for SOS commercials. And this is how I found myself watching Jessica Simpson on a Thursday morning!  I was watching the video for her song With You, and first off, I thought it was frightfully funny that the video's producers tried to make viewers believe that Jessica's life with Nick now involves any cleaning at all because we've all seen their show, the house is always a pit and when it needs cleaning they bring someone in to do it. But still, suspending that minor disbelief, I was way distracted at the image of her rubbing her cleaning gloved hands into her hairall sexy like. We people who actually clean know the nasty places those gloves go. Just when my stomach is turned at the hair bit, she puts her hands in her mouth and bites the gloves to take them off! Ew!  The next video was Kid Rock's Feel Like Makin' Love cover. I liked the intro where he has a bad dream that he's the entertainment for the 50th class reunion for the Class of 2004. He's all crickety and he kicks a chair over and yells in an old man scratchy voice, "Let's rock!" I was at my grandpa's 55th so I had a unique perspective on that one.
