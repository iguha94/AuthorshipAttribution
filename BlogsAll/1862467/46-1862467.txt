         Yesterday we drank deep from the pool of inspiration, we walked around all day drunk with dreams of the possibilities. Today, we urge ourselves to question the dreams, hold them to the light and see how much we can really do. The weather is fitting for such a day, providing a rainy and gray backdrop for our examinations.   The thing is, I think we’re still going to do it!   The rain moved in in the middle of the night. The pattering of fat droplets on the skylights woke us up. The aroma of rain on the dry, desert sand filled the house and reminded us of what we had forgotten, that rain in New Mexico is the sweetest smell on Earth. Rain fell off and on all night, it was a comforting sound, lulling us to dreams. This morning we watched the clouds and their descending horizontal rain bands move across the giant highland that slopes down from the base of the mountains.   The air that moved in with the rain is so cold, we are sure that it is snowing in the ski valley. Today we had hoped to return to the Williams Lake trail, but I think we waited one day too long. Now we’ll have to wait until spring! You would never guess is it so cold outside by sitting in here, though. The floor is comfortable without socks, and the air in the room is warmed enough by the sun that we haven’t even thought of lighting a fire. When Aidan opens the door to run outside, the air is such a shock! It must be 40 degrees out there!  We drank hot chocolate and soy milk upon waking. Now, John’s putting a pot of beans on the stove and the kids are playing busily. All is right with the world on this, our last day in the Earthship.
