         Finally, on the forth day here, Taos is beginning to sink in. The afternoon rains we enjoyed so much in September are afternoon snowshowers now in late November, and they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just rolling in for the day. A cold wind rubs up against the house in stern gusts, but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m warm and protected inside giant windows that let me view it all without braving the 20 degrees a few inches away.   My issues were threefold. First, my computer was ill, and we finally remedied the poor thing last night. This computer is like an extension of my brain, and when it was muddled, I felt muddled. After clearing the free space on the hard drive from 5% to 20%, largely be deleting my unused adobe suite and two movies, and a good cleansing defrag on both fronts, we are both thinking much clearer. Second, our Earthship was in the gravel pit out at Greater World, New Mexico. While I celebrate and applaud the efforts to reclaim this scar left on the land by usurpers of this bountiful terrain, I found myself too dependent on a straight line of sight to the grand Wheeler Peak and Taos Mountain to live for long down below in the pit. Finally, it just took this long for the wearying waves of stress and pressure that was the past six weeks to wear off.   So here I am, on day four, in my parents rental√¢‚Ç¨‚Äa lovely adobe outside of Taos√¢‚Ç¨‚Äalone with John and two sleeping babes, at last opening a word doc to write. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s good to be back.   KTAO is just wrapping up today√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s episode of Who Are You (you gotta sing the song when you say that: Who Who, Who-ooh are You). It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a great show, despite the song. The show is founded on the idea that a lot of amazing creative people from wild backgrounds are here in Taos. The host lets the guest of each day chose the music and between sets they just talk. I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t catch the guy√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s name who was on today, but he was really great. He said, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìA lot of people are really offended by my lyrics, but actually my guitar playing is far more blasphemous.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ Their conversation was so intimate, it gave me a fly on the wall, voyeur feeling I was really grooving my way into. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry it ended.   Why can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t KPFT be more like KTAO? KTAO is so unpretentious, where KPFT just tries too hard. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even think they know what they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re trying so hard to be. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m partly forever bitter toward KPFT because I interviewed there once and they didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hire me. But I was pregnant, and let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s be honest, who wants to hire a pregnant woman. Unlike KPFT, KTAO isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t public, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s for profit. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the world√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s first solar radio station. They aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t evil because they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re for profit either. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re just really ethical about their advertisers and the averts don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t take over the programming. Like this program I was listening to was in a real rhythm so you could tell they put off the ad-break.   On weekday mornings they have this community program where anyone can call in for anything. People call in to say they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve lost their dog, or they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re selling a couch, or renting a house, you name it. Monday we were listening and a woman called in to say she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d lost her golden retriever. Then, toward the end of the show, a woman called in to say she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d found a golden retriever, and just like that a dog was reunited with its family. I wanted to cry, it was so beautiful. This guy Brent just sits in the studio and answers the phone rapid-fire style, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHi, who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s this?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ And someone says, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHi Brent, this is Julia!√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOh, Hi Julia, how√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve you been?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ √¢‚Ç¨≈ìJust fine, fine, except you know my mother isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t doing so good, well she√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s moving to Espanola tomorrow to live with my sister and we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to take her couch, so if anyone wants to come pick it up this afternoon, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s free for the taking.√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ √¢‚Ç¨≈ìGreat Julia, what number can they reach you at?√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ and it goes on and on like this for an hour every morning.   This close community feeling is prevalent all over New Mexico, I really missed it when I was gone, and I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know that until I started spending more time here again. Last night my mom and I stopped in at the little liquor store after dinner and the girl behind the counter was telling us about this one label that her parents (the owners) carry just for this one guy because he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a family friend. We got a bottle and I got to thinking I liked her taste, so I asked her where her favorite restaurant was. She said she likes the Outpost in Ranchos de Taos, and the Bravo pub in town. Great advice! We wished her a good night, like we really meant it, not like the polite necessity in the city, and left for home.
