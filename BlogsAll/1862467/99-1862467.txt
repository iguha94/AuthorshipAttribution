         David Weinberger at JOHO has a nice veggie rant   here, with comments .     A Vegetarian Philosophy, by Peter Singer : "This recipe is vegan, very simple, nutritious, and tasty. It's also eaten by hundreds of millions of people every day.  DAL  2 tablespoons oil  1 onion, chopped  2 cloves garlic, crushed  1 cup dry red lentils  3 cups water  bay leaf  1 cinnamon stick  1 teaspoon medium curry powder or to taste  1 14-ounce can of chopped tomatoes or equivalent chopped fresh tomatoes  2 ounces creamed coconut or half cup coconut milk (optional)  Juice of lemon (optional)  Salt to taste  In a deep frying pan, heat the oil and fry the onion and garlic until translucent. Add the lentils and fry them for a minute or two, then add the water, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and curry powder. Stir, bring to a boil, then let simmer for twenty minutes, adding a little more water from time to time if it gets dry. Add the tomatoes and simmer another ten minutes. By now the lentils should be very soft. Add the creamed coconut or coconut milk and lemon juice, if using, and salt to taste. Remove cinnamon stick and bay leaf before serving.  The final product should flow freelyï¿½add more water if it is too thick. It is usually served over rice, with some lime pickle and mango chutney. Sliced banana is another good accompaniment, and so too are pappadams. "
