         A girl who works for the Sharon Osbourne Show, or maybe a friend of Sharon's, the connection was lost on me, started this line of Jewish-themed clothing that's so cute! I was thinking Hanuka is coming up, perfect gift ideas for Jewish friends (actually I only have one friend close enough to buy a Hanuka gift for), right? So I visited the website and not only can you not buy online, none of their retailers have websites!   I know I exist primarily online, and that's not too normal yet in our country, but come on! A new store, a small start-up by a young person, and no way to buy online? So I emailed the girl to ask politely if there is anything she can do to rectify this. You should email her too. Her address is: sheinamadela@sbcglobal.net. Her stuff is great, witty, sexy. I just want to buy it!    Btw, speaking of the Osbournes, have you heard about Ozzy? Poor guy. He has broken ribs, collar bone, and vertebrae. You've got to love the news, because they still say, "he's resting comfortably." I have no doubt he could think of many adjectives for his condition, all would need the famous MTV bleep, and none would be comfortable. If you ever saw the episode where Jack went to England with a friend and no parents, you know exactly what must have happened...   I know I'm a horrible person for wondering this in light of their tragedy, but since Sharon flew off to London as soon as she heard, does this mean tomorrow with Moby is cancelled?
