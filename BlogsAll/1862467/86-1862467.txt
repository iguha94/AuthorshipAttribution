         Looking at this long sap of a post I wrote earlier just makes me ill. Does drinking always bring about so much self doubt in me? Or is it just drinking during my kids' birthday week, which is a giant time of personal reflection? John and I had a lovely afternoon since it was a holiday weekend, and both the kids actually took long naps at the same time! We indulged in two rounds of martinis and then began talking about all sorts of deep subject like where our lives are headed and how sometimes I just want to adopt ten kids and John says as much as we hate vans, mini and otherwise, we couldn't handle it! It was a nice afternoon, I'm sad that it didn't look like that in my post.   I'm really happy with the way things have gone in my life so far, I have to believe I'll be happy with the way the next bit goes too. It's just that my line of sight for the next bit isn't so clear right now and, as a result, I feel like breaking through the curve when I should be applying the gas peddle.   I thought about deleting the post, and I stopped myself because blogging is live, and that means blogging is life. We all have these lows of doubt, right? I should be honest enough to present all of me on these websites if I intend to represent myslef in such an electronic way. I don't want to edit myself into some better, more presentable representation of me. This is who I am. Read me.
