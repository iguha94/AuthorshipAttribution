         It's almost the weekend, and the smell of pigskin is already in the air. Today's   King Kaufman  asks why there are so many baseball blogs, but no football blogs. He means blogs dedicated to the sport by fans. I'd kind of like to tell him because football fans have a life, but that would be flaming. But still, I love, love, love football. I have often fantasized that if I had been born a boy, I would have ended up playing pro. My grandpa was recruited from his little coal town in PA to play for UNM, and every other male in my family played football, so I come about it naturally. When Houston got a pro women's league last year, only my pregnant and bed-ridden body kept me from signing up. But you don't see me dedicating my site to football. The topic takes its place with the other cool and crappy parts of life in the posts--like kids and colons and bush bashing, right? I also don't think Kaufman took into consideration that football fans who are techies spend their online time on Madden when their baseball counterparts are blogging.  I especially noted that Kaufman did not bring up players themselves who blog. Outside of   Ricky Williams , I don't know of any. So I took the bold step of asking Ricky himself if he knew of some. Here's to hoping he answers. While checking Ricky's site today, I saw that he has a new radio show in Miami, so if you live there go support him!
