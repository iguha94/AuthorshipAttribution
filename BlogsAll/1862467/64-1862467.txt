         I just watched   Naked World on HBO . It was amazingly well done. I, like most everyone I presume, had a cursory awareness of Spencer Tunick's work, but now I feel pretty fluent in his work. This documentary followed the photographer as he traversed seven continents in the course of shooting his newest work, called Naked World, in which he captured so many individuals and groups from a wide array of countries including Canada, UK, Russia, France, Japan, South Africa, Antarctica, Brazil... The biggest installation was in Australia where 4,000 people came to volunteer for the shoot.   The filmers interviewed one woman in France who captured my own experience of breastfeeding there perfectly. She said (I'm trying to remember exactly how she phrased it) the French are very open minded about nudity in art, but the French are very narrow minded about nudity in daily reality. It was the cake topper to a perfectly odd French day for me.   If you're out of the loop, Tunick is famous for   setting up photographic installations  of naked people.   I'm sure this will replay several times this week, I recommend catching it.   It makes me sad to think that our own MFA here in Houston is doing nothing so fresh as this, would daren't do it, really. My very first job at the MFAH was in the photography department of curatorial. At the time, I felt a surge of creative edge, upcoming projects in the works then included Japanese Photography and Brassai. But this was MFAH
