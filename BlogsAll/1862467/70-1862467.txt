           Spread cheer this Christmas - The Times of India : "A child is coming who is light for a dark world, a child who is Wonder and Hero and Peace. And there is hope for everyone.  Christmas is a feast, an event hard to celebrate alone. Whether one is Christian or not, whether one is rich or poor, black or white, young or old, we all want to be part of the celebration."      VOANews.com : "In his Christmas message, he urged the world to rejoice at the birth of Christ, and he asked God to save humanity from the great evils of the start of the third millennium, including wars and terrorism.  The Pope also called for no more terrorism, no more wars and violence and no more discouragement in the search for peace. The pope said the path to peace is difficult, but possible and necessary, especially in the land where Christ was born, a reference to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.  The pope then wished the world a Merry Christmas in 62 languages."      F.A.Z. - English Version : "In his last Christmas speech before retiring early next summer, the president warned Germans against living by the cost-efficiency principle alone. We must make sure that our overall social behavior in all areas of our lives is not increasingly slave to patterns of economic rationality and efficiency, he said. Rau named three areas in which factors other than management standards are more important: ï¿½School is not a business, hospitals are not health machines and the family is not a company."
