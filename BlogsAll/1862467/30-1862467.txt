         I've had so many reasons to stop watching the View. Don't act like you don't watch daytime TV because you have a job or a life or whatever, just TiVo it. First they maligned Lisa, eventually pushing her out. Then, they seem hell bent on replacing her with someone conservative and boring enough that they won't have to malign her (they must have gotten   The Memo , too). A few weeks ago they bashed breastfeeding. And now, the last straw, they're going to do a special location View in Charleston, SC, the state all the world agreed to boycott until the hateful dixie flag was removed.   The Sharon Osborne Show speaks more directly to my culture anyway. She's been getting better and better, today she's dressed as Mortitia Adams and has Ozzy on with her (I happen to hold the Adams' family in high esteem because Mortitia was the first non traditional mother on TV and the couple were the first to sleep in the same bed on TV). Just now, Ozzy farted and Sharon smelled it and she asked him if he dropped one and Dennis Rodman, who was the guest hanging around for the pumpkin carver, said I wasn't going to say nothin! The entire stage was raucous laughter. It's hilarious. She is open and accepting to youth culture, all culture at that. She asks questions that are far closer to the questions I would ask if I had her guests on my couch.   Sharon uses a style more like Jimmy Kimmel's where guests hang around for segments. It's a far cry from the beat the clock, Letterman-esque feeling the View uses. I've been watching during the boring View segments and commercials for a while, so now I'm formally switching over my allegiance. Here's to hoping the View gets cancelled shortly after ABC execs read this blog.
