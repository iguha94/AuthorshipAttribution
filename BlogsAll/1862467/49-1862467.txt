         Since I was so dependent on other media sources, here are some links (mostly audio) of interesting things I came across this past week:    KTAO  and   KUNM  both aired a weekly show called    etown  , that is like Garrison Kiellor's Prairie Home Companion for the slightly groovier crowd. It was really, really good. To listen to E-Town archived shows, you have to register, and usually I think registering is evil and stupid, but in this case, it's worth it.   Go listen to the November 19th Show . The Lucy Kaplansky bit is the best, her closing song on 9/11 made me cry. It perfectly voiced the virtually unspoken concern and trauma the liberals of the country felt that day. If you don't want to join etown, you can still   listen live weekly here .   Weekend Edition this morning (  linked here , but scroll for individual stories) had interesting stories titled Love Trap and Open Heart. I'm sure the rest of the world knows already about the El Paso customs confiscation of bologna, but they're interview with the agent was pretty funny.    Yesterday's Morning Edition  had interesting stories titled Little Hunter and Low Wage Workers.   Catching up on a few other blogs, David Weinberger was   funny re. the bible here , scroll up a day for his interesting insight on the media and   Dean . Raed of   Where is Raed  has been very busy. He was blessed by Bush's visit, nearly crushed by an American convoy, and stopped at a checkpoint for carrying a camera.
