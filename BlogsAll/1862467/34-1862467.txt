         This morning's Fox pregame was a touching tribute to the Steelers. It made me really sad to remember that this is the first football season since Grandpa died. Grandpa was born and raised just outside of Pittsburgh and was forever the biggest Steelers fan this side of the Yakagheny. He was recruited from high school to play for UNM almost sixty years ago. Maybe he even once dreamed of playing pro for the Steelers, but instead went into the Navy and piloted a PT boat at Normandy.   Anyway, even the ornery fucker Terry Bradshaw was kind of fun to watch today as they paid tribute to all the Steelers teams of the past. His horse analogy was pretty screwy though. One too many concussions.   Today the Bears attempt to send the Detroit Lions on toward the worst record ever in the NFL for road games.   Houston plays Indianapolis , who are fresh off a bye and lead Houston's division. Houston's bested last year's average of showing up to play one quarter a game this year by typically showing up for two quarters. Last week the defense showed up for the second and third quarters, and the offense showed up for the third and forth. If everyone had shown up together, they might have one. The success or failure of today's game depends entirely upon timing.   Did you see the Raiders/KC game last Sunday night? It was a fantastic game, I only caught the second half, but that was the one to watch. This game is definitely the most commented upon game of the week, so won't repeat what has been said too many time, but I do want to say that the commentators of that game were the worst I've ever heard. The most derisive, negative voices. I didn't catch who it was, but they sucked.
