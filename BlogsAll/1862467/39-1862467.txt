         My newest love in daytime TV is DHChannel's An Adoption Story. When John was home on Monday for the holiday I made him watch with me so he could understand why I all-of-a-sudden want to adopt five kids. It turned out to be a couple (Geeta and Pi) from Houston, both doctors, and their story was _so_ romantic! They met in college and remained good friends for years after. Then, after Geeta visited Pi in Saint Louis, he confessed that he wanted more than a friendship with him, he was in love. Geeta asked her mother for permission to date Pi and her mother said no. She said the two had known each other for 12 years so they already knew everything they needed to know about each other to decide whether they should get married. Geeta told Pi and Pi asked Geeta to marry her. How beautiful!   My experience in the world, as an anthropologist and as a liberal white woman may very well have made me a person who viewed the marriages of the Indian culture as negative. However, in college, my roommate Priya was from India and she opened my eyes to the beauty and difference of her culture. She taught me not to judge without understanding. Priya did not date, and was happy waiting for her parents to find her husband. She trusted them, and she was quick to point out how many happy arranged marriages endured where Americans' did not. Clearly, Geeta's mother was wise in her judgment. And Geeta was wise for trusting her mother. How romantic!  The careers of Geeta and Pi took them to Houston and they decided to start their family. Geeta found she had issues from endometriosis that were preventing her from conceiving. Here I really must thank my own OB in El Paso who told me at 20 to conceive soon if I wanted kids after he performed a lap to treat endometriosis. Anyway, this led to the couple adopting a beautiful baby girl from and Indian orphanage. I wish them the best!
