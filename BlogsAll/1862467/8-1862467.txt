         My blog is only a few hours old and it is already time for a political entry. Bush gave his little high noon speech tonight and I want to throw up. I know what is coming, the whole world does√¢‚Ç¨‚Äand has for a while now. I have one relative who is just angry that he hasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t started the war yet. Tonight should have been so perfect for my family. A giant snow storm rages outside and the fire crackles in the corner. But our hearts are heavy with the dread of bunker-buster bombs, with the promise of mothers screaming over their dead children√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s bodies.   After the national address, I found myself at the computer looking for music for comfort and I ended up at the songs from the 9/11 tribute. The night of the tribute was so cathartic, so right. The many millions of dollars donated were proof that the songs, literature, and comments were so well put together that they were the salve the country√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s heart desired. This in turn made me all too aware of the aid we are not uniting as a country to give the families that will be destroyed in the coming days.   Whether or not each American agrees with the motive for this military action, I feel that each of us should be resolved to meet the dollars we give through taxes that pay for the bombs that will fall with dollars of aid for the individuals affected for the sake of our national security.
