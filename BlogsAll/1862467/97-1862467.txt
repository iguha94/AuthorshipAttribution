         For two years John and I have lusted after TiVo. When we'd tell friends about it we'd usually get the same response: I try not to watch too much TV. John's the epitome of peace, never gets annoyed even, but I would have to swallow my response in my throat to what was obviously a commentary on the kind of person I must be if I watch enough TV to merit a digital recording device. In time, we developed a counter argument in which we explained that TiVo actually lets you watch less crap TV because when you're in that mood to just vegetate (my mom calls it bubblegum for the mind, when you've done highly interactive brain stuff all day and just want to veg), you can rely on the vast storehouse of stuff you actually like. You aren't at the mercy of NBC's Friends re-runs or some equally smelly tripe.   So far we've found our arguments validated. Plus, we've found a few new attributes to TiVo that were unexpected. They're largely due to our parenthood. For example, when the baby accidentally falls on the toddlers lego masterpiece and both are very upset, I can press pause until the crisis abates.  Also, you are free to watch shows that the average parents' schedule prevents. I mean shows that come on after you accidentally passed out exhausted while tucking your son into bed. Last night I set the TiVo to catch two fantastic programs on Chinese civilization that ran around 3 a.m. when only shift workers or insomniacs would otherwise benefit from the experience. This morning as I sat on the couch unable to move because the cold-wrought Ellie just wants to nurse and nurse, I put them on and was pleased to watch a pop-entertainment special filmed in Beijing on New Year's Eve. They ended with this group song called Shaking Hands, the lyrical finale sang Shaking hands with the world/ shaking hands with peace/with spring/with future/shaking hands. It was so beautiful! And I would have missed that.
