         Yesterday   NASAWatch  broke a story about NASA suddenly desperate to make room on the departing Soyuz to bring down air samples, even if it meant they had to ride on Ed Lu's lap. Anytime air or water monitoring is mentioned in the news, it translates to a lot of overtime for John, and a lot of time my kids don't get to see their dad, so we all braced ourselves.   Sure enough, by the afternoon NASAWatch changed its tune on the story from just monitoring a strange scenario to making this the big issue. Words like point of no return were pulled out of a   Spaceref site  containing minutes to meetings from the last weeks' deliberations on air and water quality. The   Washington Post  appears to have been the first major news agency to report the story.   Here in Houston the news channels and the Chronicle smelled blood in the water at NASA this morning. By noon, the stories were dramatic and wild, questioning whether NASA should have launched a crew this week when the air and water on ISS might not be safe. But this afternoon was the opening day of testimony at   the Robert Durst trial  and the dogs seem to have lost the scent.   A few hours ago, a quick check on Google News shows international news agencies have   picked up on the drama , but national news stations almost completely ignored it. Now,   CNN , Fox,   MSNBC , and   Discovery News  are all posting headlines.
