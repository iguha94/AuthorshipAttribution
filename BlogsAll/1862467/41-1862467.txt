         The NYT has   a story today  about the stress hormone pigs and other meaty animals produce that can ruin the meat after butchering. They (Texas A&M researchers) tried injecting antidotes to the hormone but that was tricky to get passed the FDA so they are finally, reluctantly looking at improving the conditions of living that cause the stress in the animals. Gig'em.   Onto a much better topic,   Real Women Online contributor Madhu  recently attended blogcon and has fantastic things to say about the emerging global conversation of blogging. I quote:  "But what impresses me the most is the solitary voice. The testimonial. So much talk at the conference about 'utopia' and 'revolution'. I'm not sure this new communication medium will revolutionize American or any other society. But. The process. Giving a voice to all the thoughts in your head. Testifying. To your own personal truth. And the stories. The millions and millions of stories. I know some people find this daunting, even troubling. Millions of mostly unread blogs, posts, stories. A mirror of our mortality and vulnerability in cyberspace. I don't find this troubling at all. A million whispers is a roar. A billion is a sonic boom. And I like the idea of millions and millions of people typing away in English and French and Mandarin and Farsi. Throwing bottles filled with personal scribblings and musings out onto the ocean. And. Sometimes, the ocean throws back a sign. And the sign says that, after all, we are human. We are individual. And we are just learning to speak."
