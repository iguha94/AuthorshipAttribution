          	   VICTIMS OF SUCCESS	    At the start of the ninth century, the Vikings terrorised Western Europe looting monasteries and settlements. The Vikings became conquerors, settlers, builders of great fortresses and cities. They grew rich on the proceeds of manufacture and international trade. Their navigational skills pushed them to the very edge of the world. So how did this evolution occur?  	 As the Viking sphere of influence grew, so did the ambition of Viking chieftains. They wanted absolute power as well as wealth, but this wasn't always a popular aspiration. Groups of Viking settlers began leaving Scandinavia for the empty lands of Iceland and Greenland. We explore the building of large and sturdy cargo ships, the ingenuity of Viking survival clothing and the mysteries of navigation in an age before magnetic compasses. Finally, their naval skills enabled the Vikings to reach the end of the world… America.   The documentary follows one archaeologist to Nova Scotia on his quest to identify the landscapes of Vinland described in the Viking sagas. His journey also reveals the weaknesses behind the Viking expansion, as we ask: why did the Vikings disappear from history?   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Genius of the Vikings Sunday 8th & 15th February  10pm UK      In 865 AD, a 'great army' of Viking ships invaded England. The Viking capital was Jorvik- the modern city of York. Manufacturing, building, town planning- the Vikings of York were settlers and conquerors.   By the mid-ninth century their trading journeys had taken them through Russia and even as far as Constantinople. We visit Gotland, a small island in the Baltic Sea, to explore the enormous wealth in Viking silver that lies mysteriously buried there.
