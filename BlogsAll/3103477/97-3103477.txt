         my first blog on here was mac whatever for mac stuff, and i put loads of news about mac stuff on there, i mean i use a mac all the time, and get tons of news and updates sent to me via email, plus i was on dotmac too, and in a couple of mac yahoo groups. but i had a change of heart. i deleted the entire blog. why? i realised i was advertising apple products by doing this. and there are plenty of websites with apple news, apple stuff for sale now. so why repeat it?  at first i thought, i would put it on a blog so it would be info for me to check back to. eg all the mac websites i visit. news that i saw that seemed important. but now i haven't been going on those sites, nor am i reading the apple emails i get. nor am i trying out new applications. or going on mac.com even though i have a subscription.  so why bother with a mac blog with news on if i don't really care about most of it, and it's irrelevant to me. it all got deleted.  then after i did that, my friend said to me, omg where's your mac whatever blog?  i though no one else read it.  i said i had deleted it due to lack of interest. lack of interest on my part that is to just repeat what i got in emails. which are mostly ads let's face it.  so are the online mag articles, really it sums up to free advertising. next i'll get a t-shirt with apple on you know. buy a t-shirt and walk around adverstising the product. look i should get paid for wearing a company's logo, it makes me and anyone else who does it a walking billboard. and i paid to be a billboard? nuts isn't it?  but my pal said that was a good name..mac whatever, put it back. so i did, and i try to put just opinions or rants i suppose on there, okay there's some dumb info, and a little news, but i can't promote something like that. i mean especially when i am so angry that so many things are mac incompatible.  and my mac has been much better without all that updating and mucking around.  happy mac now.
