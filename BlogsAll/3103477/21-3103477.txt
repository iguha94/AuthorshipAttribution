         Other triggers In addition to these common allergy triggers there are other factors in the environment that can make life difficult for airborne allergy sufferers.   *	Air pollution: High concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and other chemicals that find their way into the atmosphere can irritate the nose and airways even in those who do not suffer from airborne allergy. One of the effects of the late phase allergic response is to make the nasal passages more sensitive to irritants – something called nasal hyper-responsiveness.  *	Other irritants: Smoke (particularly tobacco), strong smells, perfumes, changes in temperature, or humidity can all provoke symptoms in people who have developed this extra sensitivity (nasal hyper-responsiveness).  *	Diesel fumes: Importantly, there is another factor concerning irritants and pollution in the air. As well as provoking symptoms, by weakening the delicate nasal lining, irritants may increase susceptibility to allergy triggers. Research has shown that diesel particles in the air make people more sensitive to an allergy trigger.  *	Air-conditioned atmospheres: In a person whose nasal lining has been made extra sensitive by repeated allergic attacks, the atmosphere in the work place can provoke symptoms of an airborne allergy even without allergy triggers in the air. Non-allergy, irritant triggers are often found in an air conditioned atmosphere. Chemicals, pollution sucked from outside, changes in air temperature, dust, low humidity and other factors in the ‘sick building syndrome’ can all provoke symptoms. Even good air conditioning, with efficient air filters, while it may reduce the level of pollen, will not eliminate all air pollution.
