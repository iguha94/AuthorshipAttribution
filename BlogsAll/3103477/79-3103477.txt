         JOHN FRUSCIANTE CONT. >>   Frusciante has many celebrity admirers. Past lovers include model-actress Milla Jovovich and art kid Stella Schnabel, and Vincent Gallo asked Frusciante him to score his controversial movie The Brown Bunny before the script was even written. "Every time I wrote something really sad I put it aside for [Gallo]," says Frusciante, insisting that despite the controversy film caused at the Cannes Film Festival, the movie is a misunderstood and beautiful masterpiece that will be appreciated in due course. None of the music he wrote made it into the actual film, but the soundtrack album (available via Tower Records... in Japan! Click here to purchase!) that accompanies The Brown Bunny will feature four of Frusciante songs. In the album's liner notes, Gallo writes: "Every day [during filming] I would listen to John's music... How and why when the film was done it did not include John Frusciante's music is difficult to explain. In a sense it is unexplainable. I did, however, make a film to John's music and John did make the music to my film."  This kind of worship and involvement in the pop-culture underground only enhances Frusciante's cult status. In keeping with this outsider mentality, he recoils at the current, corporate-influenced state of mainstream arts. "The incredible thing is that the industry of music and film are really suffering," he says. "It doesn't make any sense." Thankfully for him, he belongs to one of the most lauded bands in the world, so he needn't feel too guilty. In any case, he has the hundreds of songs in his head that he promises to record eventually. Until then, let's hope he can keep this perfect balance.
