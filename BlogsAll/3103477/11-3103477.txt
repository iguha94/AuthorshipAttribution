         1. Shelving:- Keep clutter to the minimum, wipe shelves regularly. Try not to use perfume sprays in a small bathroom as these can act as an irritant. Try using a quarter of a cup of white vinegar as an air freshener. Remember that the phrase 'suitable for sensitive skin' has no legal definition and does not mean that it will not cause a reaction. Try and use non-perfumed soaps or cleansing oils.  2. Loo:- Be carefully with the chemicals you use in the loo as these can irritate the respiratory system. Always wear protective gloves when cleaning the loo. If sensitive to chemicals use an equal mixture of domestic borax and vinegar to treat hard water deposits. See our Handy Hints factsheet. Avoid using perfumed sprays to sweeten the loo - opening the window is just as effective. Our Handy Hints page has some suggestions that may help.   3. Radiator/towel:- Dry towels outside or tumble dry them to avoid increasing the humidity in the bathroom.  4. Mat on Floor:- Use washable cotton rugs rather than carpet which will become damp and encourage mould and house dust mite growth.  5. Bath/shower:- Open the window as soon as possible after using the bath/shower. Try to dry the shower curtain as quickly as possible after use. If mould appears on the shower curtain or around the bath clean it with a paste of vinegar, lemon juice and borax. Apply and then rinse well. To clean tiles rub the surface with undiluted white vinegar. Leave for 15 minutes then rinse thoroughly. To clear clogged shower head - dismantle the shower head. Soak the pieces in a bowl of white vinegar for 2/3 hours. Clean off sediment with a stiff brush.  6. Plant:- If having plants in the bathroom, go for succulents or other types that require minimum watering to reduce the opportunity for mould.
