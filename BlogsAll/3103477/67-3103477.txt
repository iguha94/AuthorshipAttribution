         i can say this. i think they do. my opinion. i have a variety of reasons for this, all from my OWN observations of the NME. (new musical express becomes the enemy..good healine pun there..o.o, so tabloid) how about NME is SHITE. that's better.  where's the bloody music in it. all they yap about is drugs, mainly about shrooms in this past issue. worse they are advertising shrooms because they are outright saying shrooms are cool. see?  what to ads do?  they say: this is the coolest in thing to do, and have, and if you don't have it you will no longer be in the human race, and will be kicked out, and ostracised, bullied, left out, made fun of, your life will be sheer hell because of it...so you better bloody buy our product now! see? NME and drugs~shrooms, oooo how cool, we don't say mushrooms, becaues the druggie word for them is shrooms. we are so IN. god i hate them. oh "pills" are IN. what kind" who knows? just take PILLS PILLS and more pills of any kind...i am being facetious, sarcastic, and bitchy there. I am not saying take them. NME says that. okay, what else? drink until you die, fall over in a coma, shag anyone anywhere, and take any sodding drug you can get your hands on. eat pills like they're candy. pass out in the mud. die of an overdose. feel like a total arsehole. do things you actually do regret later, maybe not the day after...but it'll get ya...hahahahaha!  okay. now they have said "The Darkness are JUMPING FOR JOY that Bowie cancelled" Yeah, okay enemy (NME WILL BE SO CALLED FROM NOW ON) make them look like they are happy Bowie is ill. with your lame puns.
