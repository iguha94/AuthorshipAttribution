         "Modern scholars believe that certain examples of berserker rage to have been induced coluntarily by the consumption of drugs such as the hallucinogenic mushroom *Amanita muscaria* (Howard D. Fabing. "On Going Berserk: A Neurochemical Inquiry." Scientific Monthly. 83 [Nov. 1956] p. 232), or massive quantities of alcohol (Robert Wernick. The Vikings. Alexandria VA: Time-Life Books. 1979. p. 285). While such practices would fit in with ritual usages, other explanations for the berserker's madness have been put forward, including self-induced hysteria, epilepsy, mental illness or genetic flaws (Peter G. Foote and David m. Wilson. the Viking Achievement. London: Sidgewick & Jackson. 1970. p. 285). "  in modern times, in a social situation/polite society, the cities now huge, and suburbs sprawling..it may be considered a "genetic flaw" or "handicap" or "disability". but surely it was considered a beneficial trait to have? or 'sacred/divine' ability. being a great fighter would be a benefit, and could be used beneficially..and that's still been a theme in modern times. the superman. the great fighting machine. superhero. attempts have been made recently along these lines. obvious one is the nazis. but how about the USA?  icons of usa: Arnold and Sylvester as unstoppable fighting machines. either as heroes.  or, as a horrific unstoppable villain.  how about the villains of hollywood? unstoppable. you keep shooting at them and they don't die. you think they're died and they jump up and attack you again. eg. Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street.   even now it's of some benefit.  but not so much if you are a woman. female berserkers now, get put in hospitals, asylums, and are medicated to stop them being aggressive.  is it not natural to be aggressive, protective, over your children? your home/nest? an angry woman is looked down upon, and ppl do their best to shut them up. and say they are crazy.
