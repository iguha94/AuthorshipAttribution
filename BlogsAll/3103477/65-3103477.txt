Police said the death was not being treated as suspicious and asked for privacy for the Howard family.   The Devon band have cancelled a show booked for Wednesday in Bergamo, Italy.

The trio from Teignmouth, who also include singer Matt Bellamy and bassist Chris Wolstenhome, were the top act on the main stage on Glastonbury's third and final night.   Bill Howard was pronounced dead at the Festival Medical Centre half an hour after he collapsed.   A statement released on behalf of the band said: "Mr Howard collapsed on site at 0115 BST and died shortly after. Avon and Somerset Police are not treating the death as suspicious.   Second death   "In this dreadfully difficult time, we request that the privacy of Dom's family and friends is respected. Our sincere and heartfelt sympathy extends to Dominic and the Howard family."   Somerset and Avon Police confirmed they were not treating the death as suspicious.   A second death at the festival, of Neil Clinnings, 24, from Cleveleys in Lancashire, is believed to be drug related.   He was found collapsed in the early hours of Saturday in a car park near the festival site.
