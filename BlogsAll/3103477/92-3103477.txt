            The Darkness - More live dates planned in 2004 The Darkness Extras      JUSTIN TIME FOR XMAS!   THE DARKNESS plan to tour the UK at the end of the year.  Following their headline slot at the Carling Weekend: Reading And Leeds Festivals, the band have lined up an 18-date UK arena tour for November and December, according to Music Week.  The dates will be fans last chance to see the band before they record their second album in early 2005.  Speaking about the band’s success, Justin Hawkins said the group’s forthcoming appearances at the Carling Weekend: Reading And Leeds festivals will be a highlight.  He said: "It was always my dream to play at Reading, let alone headline it. I’m not sure if there has been a band that has headlined Reading, T In The Park and the Irish festival Oxegen in the same year, let alone a band doing it on their first album.  "The arena tour in November will also be amazing. I’m looking forward to the end of that which will finish with three dates at Wembley, although I’m not sure If that is all confirmed yet."  Meanwhile, the band are set to re-record 'Get Your Hands Off My Woman' for an American single with Foreigner and Cheap Trick producer Roy Thomas Baker.  Plus, they plan to release a Christmas DVD - said to include the band's 'first feature film' alongside an on-the-road documentary and collected videos.  source nme  glad i didn't go to the festivals. thank you to me for having patience for once, and waiting, thinking they'd probably do more shows, and not fest ones.
