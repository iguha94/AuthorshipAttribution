         my new toy is a pink elephant electric toothbrush for kids. it's really battery powered by 2 AAA batteries. now this thing is the business. 1~it's a pink elephant 2~it's a very soft and small toothbrush. 3~it cleans my teeth better than anything else i have ever used. including fancy adult electric toothbrushes. 4~it is so soft you can massage your gums with out them bleeding. 5~it's small so you can get it in your mouth  to the nard to reach parts. 6~my teeth feel like i've just had them professionally cleaned. 7~not much effort or time involved. 8~it's also useful for massaging other parts of my face that have been injured. yes i clean it first.  9~my nose was broken when i was 13, and i've had all sorts of problems since then. even going to a physiotherapist for my jaw, which was affected by the nose injury. but low and behold, the pink elephant toothbrush works better as in provides more relief than the fancy sound stuff or whatever it was they were doing, that actually hurt like hell, and left my whole skull vibrating for hours. 10~that physio also didn't work, but hey lil pink toothbrush does, and on my nose too.  11~it cost just over £3.00 in my local chemist!!!  14~i've just notice, that where i used it on my left jaw joint (where i have TMJ) and the left side of my nose, are nice and soft. something like this would be good for the skin and circulation. i'm sure. 15~i loathe those massage things you can buy that are supposed to relief pain, they don't. they're annoying, and cost loads. 16~damn a kid's electric toothbrush people! for £3.00..batteries still haven't run out....
