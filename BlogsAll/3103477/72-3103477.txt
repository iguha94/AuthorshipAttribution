         at t in the park. to replace david bowie.  what i want to know is: why does the woman below lapse into a rant about a Sparks gig she went to? wasn't the piece about t in the park and the darkness, and bowie?  and if she had a reason to rant, she didn't make it clear.  besides, i do recall Sparks, and I did know they were around, and like her I'd rather go to a small gig than a huge sprawling festival. or even a big stadium gig.   what i don't like about fests, has been well demonstrated by this bowie business. if i want to see say david bowie, i want a ticket that specifically is for david bowie. for a bowie concert. so i know that's what i am getting. and if he cancels for whatever reason, i get a refund, and can get tickets for a future gig of his when it happens. it's cancelled, okay you lot get the tickets first for the gig in x place and x date. to see the show you paid for. not someone else.  or wandering around aimlessly....  i want music, not massages and clowns etc.  i can get those at any fecking place. bouncy castle? whoa. i can get that at a regular fairground. booths to spend all your money at? whoa! i can do that all the goddamn time in Reading!  ranting day today.  wish the music would happen elsewhere.
