          {{Scandinavia}} The Varangians or Variags were Vikings who travelled eastwards from Sweden. Promoting trading, piracy and mercenary militarism, they roamed the river systems and portages of what later became Russia, reaching the Caspian Sea and Constantinople. They created a network of strongholds and trade posts establishing the first Russian state.  The Slavs and the Byzantines, however, did not distinguish between Scandinavians and closely related Germanic subsets, when they used this term. In the Russian Primary Chronicle, this term also includes Englishmen.   Rus'  The Varangians (Varyags, in Russian) are first mentioned by the Russian Primary Chronicle as having arrived from beyond the Baltic Sea around the mid-9th century, invited by the warring Slavic and Fennic tribes to bring peace to the region. They were led by Rurik and his two brothers Askold and Dir, who settled around the Slavic town of Novgorod. These early Varangians were likely legendary, but a real Swedish settlement, Aldeigjuborg, was established around Lake Ladoga in the 8th century. The Slavic inhabitants called these Swedes Rus.  The role of the Varangians in Russian history was an important subject of discussion in the 19th century Russian historiography. The proponents of the so-called "Norman theory" of the Russian state - including Nikolai Karamzin and, later, Sergey Pogodin - believed the claims of the Primary Chronicle that the Varangians were invited by East Slavs to rule over them and bring order. The theory was not without political implications. In Karamzin's writing the norman theory formed the basis and justification for Russian autocracy, and Pogodin used the theory to claim that the Russian state was immune to social upheavals and revolutions, because people's submission to their rulers was voluntary from the very beginning. Already in the 19th century the "Norman theory" was disputed by the more liberal sectors of the Russian society and by some Polish historians.
