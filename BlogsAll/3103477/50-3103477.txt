          "Mummy's Boy  The Daily Star carries an interview with Darkness frontman Justin Hawkins today in which he reveals that his mum used to hang out with infamous rock wild man Brian Jones, the Rolling Stones' original drummer. It seems her acquaintance with Jonesy helped her inspire Justin's love of catsuits.  He tells the tab: "She used to hang out with Brian Jones and tell me this story about him turning up in a disco in a pink catsuit and unzipped it dangerously low as he danced with the girls. I've always thought that was how rock stars should look."  Not only did Justin's mum know Brian Jones, she once shared a bottle of scotch with none other than Jimi Hendrix. Perhaps this explains Justin's love of guitar solos: "I always valued virtuoso guitar and singers in tight trousers screaming. That was my perception of what rock should be.""  from top of the pops bbc site    actually, i've seen this story in a few places. i'm certain it's on the main bbc site as well, either norfolk bbc, or suffolk bbc. they seem to be both laying claim to the darkness these days.  why is this so wierd? well, my father hung out with Brian Jones, that's why. where? not in suffolk or norfolk, though his family is from norfolk, well his mother is. but why tell my whole family's ancestry now? this was in the Reading area. Brian Jones is from Woodley, just outside Reading. My father went to school with Brian Jones girlfriend. met at Mr Jones at a pub. and so on, as these things go.  so where was the Hawkins mum when this was all going on? when? where? etc?
