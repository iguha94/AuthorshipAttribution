         `Justin's the same size as me'  Jul 15 2004  By The Huddersfield Daily Examiner    You'd think a skintight catsuit would need several fittings - almost like a wedding dress.  But in the hectic world of The Darkness there's no time to stand around in half-finished garments.  Lucy, who also designs clothes for R&B star Jamelia and the Pet Shop Boys, says: "Justin's so busy, I never get any fittings with him.  "But he's the same size as me. We're both about 5ft 8ins. He might be a bit broader than me, and of course I've got a bust - though it's not very big!  "I know that if Justin's suit fits me, it'll fit him. So that's how I check, I try it on."  Sometimes the band might be at the other side of the world when a catsuit is finished, so it's just sent over.  "I'll get a phonecall saying: `It's great!' I love to be there in person when Justin tries an outfit, but I can't always be."  The rigours of Justin's energetic stage routine mean any outfit has to be tough as well as attractive.  "Justin jumps around a lot so the suits have Lycra panels for movement.  "But when they come back for a tour, they're in a terrible state. They need specialist dry-cleaning and a lot of repairs."  When Justin, 29, was a music technology student at the Tech between 1995 and 1997, he bought his Austin Powers-style clothes at charity shops.  Now, on his days off, says Lucy, he wears nothing but designerwear.  "Always Dior!" she says.  Now, the pair are working on looks that are ever more opulent.  "He's going upmarket," says Lucy. "Justin's going to look more beautiful than ever."
