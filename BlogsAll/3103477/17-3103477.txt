         NasalezeTM - the invisible mask that filters allergens  Sneezing ... runny nose ... watery eyes Now you can combat hay fever and other allergies with our totally natural remedy  NasalezeTM is registered as a Class One Medical Device. It is an inert cellulose powder and has no known side effects. NasalezeTM has the ability to improve the quality of the air reaching the lungs. The powder, when inhaled, works by turning to a gel like material on contact with the moisture which is always present in the nasal tract. This gel then behaves like real mucus in the nasal tract which adsorbs all the dust, germs etc. from the air stream as it passes through on its way to the lungs. It is known that some people who suffer from hay fever, asthma and eczema have a lack of good quality mucus in the nasal tract. NasalezeTM restores this situation back to normality and eliminates most allergic reactions. One sniff into each nostril from the special dispenser will last at least 12 hours.   The nasal tract forcibly separates out any allergens in the inhaled air. The purified air then serves the lungs and enables them to work properly. With clean air there is nothing to cause allergic reactions. When the natural filtration system breaks down, a number of self defence systems come into play. One of these is triggered by the mast cells positioned in the upper nasal tract. They become exposed, then give out histamine and other drugs. One of these is known to cause eczema in some people.  NasalezeTM restores the nasal tract to its full working capacity as a filter which shuts down this self defence system since it is no longer required. It follows that the chemicals, which cause the allergic reactions, are no longer introduced into the blood stream. A whole variety of problems are resolved. We know from experience that in most cases when NasalezeTM is used, hay fever symptoms abate in 3 to 10 seconds.
