         JOHN FRUSCIANTE at the Knitting Factory’s AlterKnit Lounge, March 12 The Red Hot Chili Peppers have built an image antithetical to subtlety, and guitarist John Frusciante has chosen to break that mold. Of course the last two releases by the groundbreaking L.A. rock/funk outfit have expressed more mature subject matter — simply and precisely composed, and textured by Frusciante’s silky, melodic approach to his instrument and to songwriting. Tonight, though, he attempted to engage on more visceral and ambient levels by channeling a raw and seemingly unrehearsed soundscape. A shoeless Frusciante sat on the floor of the stage and remained there as he sucked us into his own world with an almost uncomfortably intimate demeanor. After greeting the small room, he assaulted the crowd with 20 minutes of ear-splitting synthesized noise and modulated feedback à la Brian Eno and Flying Saucer Attack, a movement in chaos colored with hints of melody from the underlying drone of a recorded choir ensemble.    Cameras flashed distractingly as the audience was suspended in anticipation of the songs they had come to hear (and never did). When Frusciante finally picked up his guitar and was joined by second guitarist Josh Klinghofer, they wove a 10-minute instrumental, sweet with impeccable licks that could have been picked up off of the cutting-room floor of a Velvet Underground session. Then Frusciante stood, waved, smiled and left. Inviting a voyeuristic viewpoint into the creative process, he left the impression that this was an artist worthy of attention outside of his band. He had displayed the validity of honest music-making, void of labels and pretense. (Ryan Ward)
