         Woodland Trust supporter, Met Office senior broadcast meteorologist, Michael Fish, says: “Higher temperatures are extending the grass flowering season. Like me, many more people will be condemned to longer bouts of sneezing, itchy eyes, headaches and a throbbing nose. Information collected by amateur phenologists throughout the UK – who record naturally occurring seasonal events in gardens, parks, woods and high streets – will help to forecast the start of the pollen season, so please become a phenology recorder.”    Professor Jean Emberlin of the National Pollen Research Unit explains: “Last year the grass pollen season was exceptionally long because it was wet and warm. The season extended into August, instead of ending in July. Generally, hayfever is affecting more and more people. Numbers have risen since 1965 when between 10 to 12 per cent of the UK population were affected, to today’s figure of 15 to 25 per cent in the population as a whole. Whilst grass pollen is the commonest trigger, birch pollen is important too. The birch pollen season has been occurring five to ten days earlier per decade over the last 30 years. By letting us know when you see trees and grasses beginning to flower, it will give us information about flowering times in advance of pollen release and it will help us to improve forecasting the start of pollen seasons. This will help you to take your medication at the right time.”    Phenology statistics comparing grass flowering dates between 2002 and 2001 show that for the UK as a whole, cocksfoot flowered nine days earlier; meadow foxtail 13 days earlier and Yorkshire fog nine days earlier.
