          Madonna will tour holy sites in Israel after her Re-Invention tour, according to Israeli newspaper Maariv. The superstar will be one of 100 Kabbalah students who will visit areas of religious significance in Autumn to coincide with the Jewish New Year on September 15.

I never claimed it was. It's some scrapbook I'm keeping, that's all, and sometimes, okay quite frequently, I come across things that are so stupid and boring like this. She's so boring. If I rant anymore I may get in trouble, I mean seem slike she has eyes everywhere. O.o I was living in Wiltshire near Stonehenge for a while, and it got so tiresome reading or hearing about her and her Wiltshire estate.
