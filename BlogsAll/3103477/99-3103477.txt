         allergies are terrible today. got worse when let dog in garden, and he ran back in. he'd been digging. he keeps digging in the same hole in the garden.  he brought the post up to the bedroom today, well sort of. he managed to get one to the top of the stairs. one at the bottom of the stairs. and the other half way along the hall towards the stairs.  luckily none ripped up. only corners messed up a bit.  thinking how the heck to stop him doing this. he only just started a few days ago. but he seems to think it's great fun.  he was also discovered two days ago in the garden, when i let him out with what looked suspiciously like a glasses case. but he wouldn't come over to give it up.  anyway, finally grabbed it off him, and it turned out to be david's glasses case. then david found the glasses as well, chewed up in the grass. thankfully they were the reading glasses but we just got them 2 weeks ago and they're prescription glasses. not ones you get off the shelf for reading. so we were furious.  keep going through training stuff with the dog, but how to stop him pinching stuff, even from great heights i don't know how.  and he has his own chews. so he isn't lacking in that department.  also he gets lots of attention otherwise, and  we're home almost all the time.  he may be bored, i suppose, with me stuck in with allergies. but how to sort this one out?  can't have him chewing up thing like that.
