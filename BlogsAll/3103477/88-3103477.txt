         RAIDERS BY DESIGN	Â    In the eighth century AD, the Vikings took the world by storm.  In the three hundred years that followed, their armies conquered large parts of Europe; their merchants blazed a trail through Russia to the Middle East; and their ships sailed to the very ends of the Earth: to a place we now call America. 	 This documentary also delves deeper into the way the Vikings fought and their weapons. Warriors were armoured with swords, axes, shields and mail coats. But just how effective were these? Investigation of their sword-making shows a complex process that produced weapons of great style but not always top quality.   Viking men lived and fought together, feasted together, worshipped pagan gods together. Was it this unity that made them such a devastating force? Was Viking pagan belief in war and heroic death, combined with their cutting edge naval technology, the true secret of their success?   Within fifty short years, Viking bands conquered most of England and were poised to take on the world's wealthiest empire: Byzantium.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Genius of the Vikings Sunday 8th & 15th February  10pm UK    The Vikings first burst on the scene in 793 AD with a savage hit-and-run raid on the coastal monastery of Lindisfarne in northern England, one of many to come. Their brutality had become legend, but did the Viking achievement rest on more than just violence?   The secret of Viking success at raiding came from speed and surprise. And this came from their long, sleek sailing ships.   Modern tests reveal that their speed and manoeuvrability came from the Vikings' superb understanding of ship design and technology. The long ship was truly a secret weapon.
