         Wierd!!!! :O It's been niggling at me for a couple of weeks now. Maybe longer. People ask how many concerts I've been to, and I don't know, because it's too many to count. I lost count years ago. I don't even go anymore.  Haven't for several years. But I've been to plenty. I saw Adam Ant with my friend Lys in NYC, I'll recall which venue it was sometiime...but by then I stopped collecting all the rock concert ticket stubs and pinning them on my wall... I suddenly remembered The Romantics had opened for Adam Ant, and I'd forgotten they existed even.  I sort of chuckled when I thought how popular they had been then, and that for years I'd forgotten about them. Well, Creem is back. So it says on their website. Odd too, I was trying to remember that "other rock magazine" in the US that was pretty funny, unlike "Rolling Stone." Not very funny.  Creem is back, and what did they have a link for? The Romantics!!!! See? Wierd isn't it?  I never used to get that Boy Howdy thing. O.o I think I do now though.  Back to the SEx PiSToLs. Sid is reading MAD magazine in one of the photos, that was a good one too. Got it each issue. Now I look at it, and think what the? I was allowed to read that when I was 10!!? :O Things were more easy going back then, see, they really were. People in the States now would never allow a 10 year old to read that. They might even consider taking your kid away for it!  "They"..who are they? hmmm....
