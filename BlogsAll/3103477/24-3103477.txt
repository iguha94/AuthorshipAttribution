         THE WILL TO DEATH — John Frusciante Hey John, heard that.  There's a fine line between being prolific and being a pest.   Red Hot Chili Peppers' guitarist John Frusciante hasn't crossed it yet — but he's definitely inching closer with The Will to Death, his second solo CD this year and one of several due in coming months.  A tender concept disc about love, loss and existence, Will to Death's dozen sketchy cuts contain the poetically confessional lyrics, organically flowing arrangements and basement-fi experimentalism that have already come to define Frusciante's solo approach.   Which is a nice way of saying that if you've heard one of his discs, you've sorta heard them all.  But unless he plans to vary his routine a little — or at least write some stronger choruses — we might not need to hear many more.  Track Listing:  • 1. Doubt • 2. Exercise • 3. Time Runs Out • 4.
