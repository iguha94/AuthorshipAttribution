         "If paparazzi shots of Britney Spears picking her nose and Hillary Duff getting a parking ticket just aren't doing it for you anymore, and the pages of In Touch magazine seem nothing more than a blur of neon captions, exclamation points and arrows pointing to thongs sticking out of sweat suits, fret you not. Thanks to French photo-journalists Pascal Rostain, 45 and Bruno Mouron, 50, there is now a new, improved, even more intrusive and stalker-like way to idolize and relate to your favorite celebrities. For the past 14 years, the Paris Match photographers, armed with a celebrity star map and a pair of rubber gloves, have been waiting til the sun goes down to rifle through, collect, and photograph celebrity garbage. That's right: trash, refuse, waste, Governor Schwarzenegger's empty Newman's Own Lemonade cartons. And through July 16, at the Star Trash Store in Manhattan, you can view Star Trash, an exhibit of photographs documenting 25 Hollywood superstars' waste products, including (but not limited to) Madonna's empty Cocoa Pebbles box, Mel Gibson's discarded Etch-A-Sketch, and Steven Spielberg's tattered copy of TV Guide. "  seeing the pics, i'm thinking at least a few of these celebs, knew these guys were looking in their trash that day, and put in photos of themselves, and kids. i mean throwing away perfectly good photos of yourself, when you're Arnie? and it isn't exactly the most avant garde thing to do now. ppl have been going through celeb trash for years. whoopee! nothing very exciting here. except Ronald Reagan's rubbish bin contained a white bra. nancy's?
