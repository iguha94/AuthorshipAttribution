         RHCP make millions  (Wednesday July 14, 2004 03:42 PM)  Red Hot Chili Peppers' three sold-out Hyde Park shows made $17 million [Â£9 million]. The June 19, 20 and 25 shows shifted a combined total of 258,000 tickets, in addition to 169,000 tickets sold for dates in Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh. The European president of promoters Clear Channel said: "It blew our minds. The first show sold out in a couple of hours, then we put up a second show and it went clean just as quickly." He added that if Hyde Park had been available for further shows: "I think we could've done another two or even three... The Red Hot Chili Peppers are an incredibly huge band in Europe." While the US has seen a downturn in ticket sales, leading to the cancellation of this summer's Lollapalooza touring festival, he added: "The European concert market is coming off one of its strongest in 50 years, with stadium show after stadium show." Red Hot Chili Peppers will release a double live album recorded at the shows, "Live In Hyde Park", in Europe, Australia, Japan and New Zealand on July 26. The track listing is:  Disc 1 1. "Intro" 2. "Can't Stop" 3. "Around the World" 4. "Scar Tissue" 5. "By The Way" 6. "Fortune Faded" 7. "I Feel Love" 8. "Otherside" 9. "Easily" 10. "Universally Speaking" 11. "Get On Top" 12. "Brandy" 13. "Don't Forget Me" 14. "Rolling Sly Stone"  Disc 2 1. "Throw Away Your Television" 2. "Leverage Of Space" 3. "Purple Stain" 4. "The Zephyr Song" 5. "Californication" 6. "Right On Time" 7. "Parallel Universe" 8. "Drum Homage Medley" 9. "Under The Bridge" 10. "Black Cross" 11. "Flea's Trumpet Treated By John" 12. "Give It Away"    so to whom exactly does all this money go? because it doesn't all go to the chili peppers. as this suggests. o.o warner bros? stadium promoters? er warner..time warner ..time warner and whoever else they are now..is it fox as well..ted turner..? okay well it's WB looney tunes anyway.
