           Psychohistorical Crisis - Donald Kingsbury     Well I've just finished reading this truly epic work of mind-blowing science fiction.  It's cerebral, idea-driven SF at it's purest, and a worthy (if somewhat left-handed) tribute to Isaac Asimov's Foundation novels. Basically, Kingsbury takes the whole notion of a benign group of prophets watching over humanity and utterly deconstructs it.   In the process, he covers a lot of ground - conceptually (the evolution of measures, the nature of personality, the meaning of history...), geographically (from Old Rith - Earth - to galaxies far beyond) and more. There are sly little references to Lost In Space, Asimov's own Daneel Olivaw, those Laws of Robotics, William Shakespeare, Gibbon's Decline and Fall (which also influenced the Foundation series) and much more tucked away here and there.  There are some very colourful, interesting characters - Hyperlord Kikaju Jama, the dilletante revolutionary, the beautiful, light-hearted but searingly intelligent Otara of the Calmer Sea, and so on.   The writing style itself pays homage to Asimov's own broad, sweeping voice, but has a more artistic texture to it. In particular, Kingsbury has a way with the sex bits that's totally non-gratuitous but satisfying at the same time. What  I mean is, without going out of his way to inject such scenes, he nevertheless tackles them well when they fit the flow, and with a minimum of detail manages to evoke an emotional atmosphere that rings true to me, at least.   But what this book is really about is ideas...and so very many of them! To do full justice to this amazing book, I'd have to go into far more detail than I have time for right now. Suffice it to say that, if all books of this length (727 pages) and detail (three lengthy appendices) were as good as this one, Robert Jordan would be a god.
