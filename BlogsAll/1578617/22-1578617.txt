         I'd like to leave aside these convoluted meanderings, this seemingly irresolvable debate between narco-apologists, the anti-narc faction (ME, oddly) and the Buddha-like golden mean (thanks for jumping in by the way - I think it’s added a lot).  I’d like to move on.  And I’d like to remind all concerned that this whole debate began because of a remark I made about a set of people who aren’t moving on.   The romance and mystique of drugs, particularly weed, seems to be a safety zone for a lot of people. I’ve moved on from that. The only thing I get out of weed anymore and the only reason I occasionally patronize it anymore, is relaxation. In my experience and opinion everything else is arrant hype.  I’ve scrawled a few verses under the influence, cranked out a line of music or two that later found its way into a finished song. But the actual sustained creative effort, I’ve only done that physically sober (though often psychologically tripping on the creative flow itself). This is the perspective from which I’m coming.  The green stuff was useful at one point because it loosened up my head a bit. But in the long run, I can’t say that anything worthwhile came out of my period of frequent usage.   The few small creative expressions I’ve managed to achieve and am happy with, were all conjured up totally sober.   I don’t need that stuff to create or to broaden my mind anymore.   Most of the people I know aren’t getting that out of it either – they are just feeding their own delusions. If you feel uncomfortable with all these statements, maybe it’s because it slices a little bit too close to some rather uncomfortable truths about you.  This is going to be my last post on the topic.  I can move on…it’s what keeps me growing. Can you?
