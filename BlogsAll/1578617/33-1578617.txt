         This is it. The heavy metal fans of today are anal, obsessive, nerdy GEEKS.   There was a time when it was all metal, basically. There was thrash and there was classic. Then came this thing called 'death' which you either got, or didn't. Now?  I just visited an Indian site devoted to metal, and here are some of the genres I actually saw mentioned in all seriousness:    Symphonic Black/Death  (violins and violence, I guess)   South Florida black metal  (not to be confused with Miami Vice)   Ancient Black metal  (the sort of thing Lara Croft digs up, I suppose)   dark and brutal death metal  (as opposed to the light and gentle kind)   hardcore metal  (aha. This is the REAL metal...right?)   Brutal Grind/Death metal  (What do they do? Brutalise you in such a way as to both grind you and make you die?)   hardcore punk metal  (Aha. Obviously not Green Day, that much is clear)   doom metal  (I think it's doomed anyhow)   avantgarde black metal  (if it ain't Celtic Frost, I don't think so)   Hindu-Scriptures-Influenced-Death-Metal-Band  (Om Nama Yama?)   old school Death Metal  (The old death metal I used to hear when I was in school)   Grind  (aha. A whole metal genre named after an MTV dance program. Odd)   ultra brutal Death Metal  (ahhhh...this must be the REAL hard stuff...right?)  eurhhh....go get a life, wankers. Or better yet, end your own.
