         I'm sad to report that Big Sister's attempts to 'clean up' Madras seem to have resulted in wiping out much of the second hand book business there. All those pavement stalls in Moor Market? They're gone. I heard they've been relocated to some building, but didn't have time to track this rumour down. I did find an old whitebeard with piles of even older text books in Mylapore. When I asked, he managed to pull out some 'novels' (his generic word for any book that is not a text-book) - I managed to get a collection of short stories by Isaac Singer, a book by Kuldip Nair and JK Galbraith's The Affluent Society. Apparently most of his 'novels' were confiscated in a recent raid. But there's hope - he said if I came by next week, he could get me more 'novels'. Of course, I won't be able to do that, but maybe next month...  Next, I headed down to Mount Road where, across and down the road from Higginbothams, I managed to find another second-hand bookstall by the pavement. He had quite a large collection and an impressive selection of fantasy and sf - I picked up books by Robert Heinlein, Jack Vance, Larry Niven, Anne McCaffrey and LE Modessit Jr. Also a few other odds and sods, including a book about serial killer Dennis Nilssen, another about witchcraft and satanism in modern times and a collection of short stories about Jack the Ripper. And a couple of Gor novels as well - although I'm not able to really fathom why I picked them up. Before you jump to the obvious conclusions, no I don't think so.   The prices were pretty amazing - this entire haul cost me about Rs. 250 - I doubt I'd be able to get more than 4 or 5 second hand books for that amount in Bangalore. It's definitely worth swinging by Madras at least once in three months or so.   Well, here's hoping the senseless persecution of this noble industry in Madras ends...
