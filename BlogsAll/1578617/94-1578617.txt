         A mental journey I went through today for a variety of reasons...  11:11 AM: my eyes are watering and I don't know why...   11:59 AM: my eyes have stopped watering but now my left cheekbone is taking on a life of its own...i have a bad feeling about this...  2:48 PM: i feel like my spinal cord is starting to unravel ... i despise fleshy human scum ... i wish i was just a grain of sand .... swept away on a tsunami ... never to see dry land again ... the briny depths .... take me away   2:56 PM: it's as if this somnolent tolling, barely worth calling a pulse, has taken over my heart and my bloodflow...i have no faith in any human emotion except hate...i want to escape this 'real' world...i want physical reality to intrude no more upon my cerebral bliss...i want a brain the size of the universe...i want to be a god...you will all be my thoughts dreams and memories...i will turn away...the pulse carries on, the intervals spaced almost beyond the perceptions of human pattern recognition...is my blood still alive? i don't want to know...  3:40 PM: getting better...my eyes feel like dried up cotton now, not a mass of fleshy nails impaling my optic nerves...the pulse is still there, just out of sync with the rest of the universe, but no longer in an obtrusive way...i imagine becoming Captain Ahab and finding god's corpse floating face down in the ocean, instead of the White Whale...it is an oddly soothing vision...there is an antiseptic feeling to the sunlight today, like the air in hospital corridors, very fresh and clean but with a hint of nameless odours thrusting underneath...tonight i will sail the waveless seas again...  And there you go.
