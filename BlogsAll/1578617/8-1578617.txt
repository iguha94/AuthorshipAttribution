         I studied journalism back in college. Plus, my dad is a journalist. The overall impression I've been able to form of the profession is that it's about gathering and dispersing timely information to the masses. Fair enough, right? Apparently, that's all wrong. As Douglas Adams observed, newspapers, magazines, TV news channels, they all actually exist as a means to deliver an audience to their advertisers.  Fair enough. But at least the pretext thereof, the news, is still the news, right? Wrong, again. The name of the game is PR, not journalism. I used to work in the ad biz. At that point, I wrote several press releases for clients. And found that the press just reprinted them verbatim, without even checking my facts. That was my first shattering revelation. I know it seems all very naive, but I was rather dissapointed. Especially when one of my releases appeared, virtually unedited, in my father's newspaper under his byline. Who do you trust anymore? Still, the couple of little changes he made to my copy were for the better, so at least my respect for the man as a wordsmith goes undamaged. I later spoke with other friends of mine in the journalism racket, and they told me they rarely touch releases because the advertisers might get pissed. Ah, so. Well, this was a more general intro to the fact that I think there is something rotten in the state of the press. What I really want to do is share a specific incident regarding a wannabe glossy entertainment mag and the nascent Indian rock scene. Await my next installment for all that.
