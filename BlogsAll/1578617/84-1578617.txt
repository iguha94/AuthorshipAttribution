         You have no reason to know this, but I happen to be a big fan of Madonna. Not because I think her songs are immortal classics (lots of them are quite forgettable) or because she makes me wiggle (she does!!! she does!!!) but because I think it's incredibly cool the way she's consistently used her sex appeal to get what SHE wants, and no apologies, cribs or recanting. She knows what we want, what we'll settle for, and just how much to give to get what she wants. And she certainly knows what she wants. Gotta love it.  Which brings me to a certain whiny skank from Canada (yes, the land of Rush and the Tea Party!) who, fortunately, seems to be doing a slow fade out lately. That's right folks. You oughta know...Alanus Menstraualette! A 'feminist icon' who whines and whines and whines about all the men who've done her wrong, an 'alternative icon' who started life with two very cheesy dance-pop albums, a 'poetess' who doesn't even know what the word 'ironic' actually means...one of the cheapest, most shallow media/music biz created phenoms snce Milli Vanilli, she actually makes the Britneys of this world look good in comparison. Hell, at least they shampoo.  Which brings me to....she has this one particularly obnoxious song called 'Unsent' which consists of whines and cribs to a whole series of ex-boyfriends (how many of those does she have, anyway??!!). Well, my friend Ravi is supposed to be working on a comprehensive parody of it, but in the meantime here's a teaser:   And richard you were a prude and your butt blushed when we were nude and you were full of platitudes but i loved you anyway  Fernando i loved the elephanto that you had in your pantso but i was too melancholic to be impressed by your prick forever and anon so goodbye    And so on. Better than the original if you ask me!
