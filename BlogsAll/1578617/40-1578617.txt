         the human yearning for continuing knowledge is a universal phenomenon. individual minds have always felt the need to learn more, and keep learning more and more, about the world we live in.  we constantly feel the need to explain most common incidents, and phenomena, because the lack of an explanation can immediately assume mysterious, and sometimes even scary interpretations. (last dark night in bed, a strange ruffling sound shook me awake; and in pure sniper-manner i froze on the source: first alerted, second hunting, third time finally secured: rotten scrap of loose paper against the wall - which in those two seconds, sounded like an intruder, perhaps a rat, an electric wire burning, cat outside, and so much more.) while the desire to learn must be rooted in the sense of acquiring and broadening understanding, this (understanding) is almost always in direct relation to immediate individual circumstance (directly thereby, influencing individual understanding). through many periods in history, several men dominated with power and force, while a few names would consistently arise in time, to lead the way, in thought, with wisdom, and intelligence. there were many such 'great minds' who were able to understand, and think in global proportions. recent times (as we know it in 2003) even found many who would much rather spend thought on worldly proportions. but commerce never impeded the student's craving for knowledge, and in fact, the latest information age is what they have already called the future. this must mean that we have so much more to learn - so much more than all of them before us did. after all, only we can speak of all that history. it just saddens me to see so many heads working so hard for the sake of money, forsaking ambition, and probably even ability. a few do yet inspire individuals. guess i need to snipe more of them.
