         I've been thinking about the use of cliches. 'Don't' is a good admonition in this regard, as far as it goes, but cliches are a lot more interesting than such an attitude would suggest.  Why do cliches happen? Because they work. Because they reflect the half-dozen or so common hopes, fears or aspirations we all carry around inside our heads. Because they connect.   Folk tales thrive on cliches - the wicked step mother, the changling child, the innocent abroad, the big bad wolf and so on. They work because they use these cliches to tell stories that resonate with something very deep in the psyche of their audience.  In this sense, cliches can be taken as 'signs' which have a universally accepted significance. Which is what words also are, after all. By manipulating these signs, the creator can do away with a lot of scene-setting and get on with the narrative, the story, the message.   There are art forms like Japanese    Noh       Theatre  which consist entirely of spinning around a set of given cliches. The thrill is in seeing what new form the old chestnuts will take this time. Superhero comics and much of the fantasy genre work on the same premise.   But cliches are so often the first and last refuge of the incompetent - this is most clearly visible in the world of cinema and television.  Where does the crossing-over point occur, the divide between an intelligent, interesting manipulation of archetypes and the mindless re-bottling of old stale wine?   *Sadly, this has nothing to do with     Karen Cliche... damn.
