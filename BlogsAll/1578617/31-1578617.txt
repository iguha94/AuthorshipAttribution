         Dude, Joydeep, you make too big a deal about altered states of mind. You can alter your mind without all the junk, if you actually have a mind. Believe me. Get in touch with your head WITHOUT that stuff. Then you wouldn't need the crutch of a phat joint to express yourself...  And frankly, I don't buy all that stuff about defining whether I mean alcohol/natural substances/hard drugs. It's all an artificially induced state, one that you haven't paid the appropriate emotional or psychological dues to achieve, and you will eventually suffer the consequences of taking the easy way out.   I enjoy the occasional spliff myself. Yes, it relaxes me. Sometimes, it helps me focus on a creative problem a little better, because the background white noise is cut out.   But you know what? I can achieve all that without inputting anything. I'm not bragging, it's true. And so can you.  I don't buy all this phoney Carlos Castaneda style baloney, and I'm chagrined at how deeply ingrained it is in people of my generation, despite evidence to the contrary, and despite alternative means of achieving the same states.  Have we learned nothing from the likes of Syd Barrett?  Substances that alter your mental state (weeds, seeds, pills, wahtever) are a dangerous shortcut, if what you're looking for is mental growth. If it's just to relax once in a while, that's ok. But don't look to a substance to give you what your mind is already capable of.  Or are you so steeped in our quick-fix consumerist culture that you don't want to evolve and explore the mind on your own?
