         This has been a rather eventful week so far. If things carry on like this, I shall probably die quite soon.  On Monday, my grandmother was ill so I stayed home to look after the house until my sister (who was recovering from another vampiric night crawl - old Vlad should BEWARE if he ever runs into this young lady!!!)woke up. Once I reached work there were, of course, thousands of things to be done. Wen it all was over, I did the usual unwind at Coffee House with trusted accomplices like Shenoy. Then I decided to hit Styx for a mug (always just a mug) and, by Gum, a friend of mine, Ashley, was having a birthday celebration. We wound up drinking till they chucked us out and then relocated to Mohan's Bar to carry on. Well, I curbed my drinking because I had an early meeting the next day, but I still can't claim I was being as virtuous as I might have. It was a night of drunken philosophy and bleary, beery sentiments.  Tuesday I reach office at 9.30 and IMMEDIATELY Ashok and me head down to the Wipro office at Sarjapur where we had to meet obscene numbers of Wiproites, one after the other, all the way till 3.00 PM at which point they very kindly released us to go meet another Wiproite at Castle Street. Woo hoo. We got back to office by 6.30, feeling dead inside. Naturally heaps of work awaited, and I was in till about 7.30 handling that. On to Coffee House, some book shopping and then to Styx for a mug (just one mug of course). At Styx I meet my friend Anand who is back in Bangalore after nearly a year in Madras, so we drink and talk till closing time when I relocate to Pecos where another friend is celebrating his 30th birthday...  Let's see how long I can keep this up...
