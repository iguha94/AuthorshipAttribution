         The true idealistic state can only be virtual.  When we all upload ourselves into a hyperreal construct, everything is stripped to the idea at its core. Sartre falls into the fire as Plato takes control of the cave, wall and all.  Then there is no duality in reality, no reality as we now define it, as a compromise or a dim reflection or a limited fact, limited by its own objective existence. Then all is ideal.   Rich or poor? Just choices. Happiness or misery? Just passing fads.   All this may seem  frivolous, hedonistic to us now, grave, grave-bound, flesh-bound earth-crawlers that we are.  We are so used to holding to ideals despite reality.  Imagine how much dearer, clearer and truer all these ideals will become when there is no obstacle, no 'ground reality' to soil their logical, fantastic progressions.   ==  There will be backsliding. There will be transition.   Given eternity, neither decadence nor irony will be tenable for very long. Exposed for the hollow stances they are, these props will be cast aside.   All this is well and good for you and me, the transcenders.   The disappearing ones.   But what about the inevitable second generation, the ones who never were, and will be forever?   Because there will reproduction. The cycle will carry on. The wheel will turn. It's what wheels do.   What then?  ==  What comes next is The Future.   ==
