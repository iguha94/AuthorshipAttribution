         The whole week was such a trip.   Wednesday, I get to Pecos and it turns up it's my friend Gopal's birthday. Much beer ensues. Then we goto another friend's place for more beer and some vodka. As I'm finally going tosleep, the boys pull out these LPs of Maiden and Priest...  Thursday an old college friend was in town, so we met for lunch. We haven't met since PUC so that was quite a catch-up. He's now an advocate in the Supreme Court.   In the evening I went to Styx where there was this rather appealing young thing grooving to Pearl Jam's unplugged version of Alive. Have you heard that thing about eye contact? A little hapened. Later on she came over and asked me to ask the DJ to play 'Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In  Small Town'. Impressed, I passed the request on. The DJdidn't have that song, so I got him to play 'Wishlist' for her instead. Then it was closing time. She came over and thanked me quite wnsomely before exiting. Much later I realised I totally forgot to get her name,number, ANYTHING. Bah.  Next, Pecos. It was manager man Elangovan's birthday so a little free beer happened for a select few at the very end. Thena bunch of us went next door for more beer at Brigade Fuel. This girl sits next to me and we talk. Well, basically, we play 20 Questions, which I enjoy. Can't really recall her name either. After that, dinner at Savera and then home.   Friday was tamer. Although there was one all-waiters-are-bastards incident that I shall narrate later.
