         OK. First of all, let me make one thing quite clear: all auto-drivers and waiters are my enemies. Their indiiference, inefficiency and dishonesty defies belief. It is now a significant part of my life's mission to treat these sub human creatures with maximum aggro and contempt.   Leaving that aside, I had a rather good weekend. Saturday, I met a couple of friends of mine from Greenpeace at Pecos and had a long talk. I tend to be pretty sceptical about the 'greens', so I bombarded them with dozens of questions, especially about their ongoing campaign against Bayer,and, encouragingly, they had pretty good answers most of the time.   I happened to have a copy of a von Daniken book wth me (Return to the stars), so I got into another conversation with another friend about the Bermuda Triangle (he thinks it's a wandering wormhole of some sort). I am a skeptic by nature, but I enjoy the cranky sode of life immensely. Which reminds me, my pet cranks, the Prophecykeepers, have sent me part 2 of their course. I must check it out soon.   Sunday was good too - a quiz, the first in ages, with my team - Shenoy and Viru. We're called Team:Roadkill. As usual we had a last-minute 4th member, a very cool chap called Ashwin, who really knew his stuff and made a significant contribution. Sadly, we missed the finals by half a point. Which left us free to wander around town, visit Blossom Book house and drink lots of coffee.   In the evening, Shenoy and me killed some time n Styx, then I met a couple of other friends at Java City and then it al was over.
