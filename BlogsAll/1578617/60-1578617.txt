         Well, I got the first installment of the Prophecykeeper's e-course. Not touch yet, unless this qualifies: 'EARTH MOTHER CRYING: Encyclopedia of Native People's Prophecies of Terror Preceding an Age of Universal Peace - $14.99 download'. Still, it's not like they require you to download this.   The first part of the 'lesson' itself deals with a series of myths among native Americans, from North and South America,about a character collectively known as the 'True White Brother'. These myths very clearly reflect a familiar culprit, Jesus the carpenter's son. I need to figure out the chronology of this - but it does seem to me that these stories sound like the sort of thing that would be spread by Christian misionaries, as filtered through generations of re-telling, if they are not outright fabulations.   The source used for all this is L. Taylor Hansen's 'He Walked The Americas' which you can read online here:http://blueotter.addr.com/he-walked-the-americas/index.htm  Now the thing is, the only L Taylor Hansen I've been able to locate who might be a likely perp, is Louise Tayler Hansen, an early writer of SF and sci-fact for Amazing and other Golden Age pulps. SF writers, when they write fact, tend to fall into two broad categories: Asimovian expounders of hard fact, and Hubbardish mad prophets.   I wonder which kind Louise was? I'll have to read her entire book, and then find some way to learn more about native American folklore, before I can say anything. This is getting to be fun...  One site claims that L. Taylor Hansen was/is an archaeologist and 'emminent diffusionist researcher' but if so, he/she seems to have left no traces apaprt from this book. Her bio (if it is the same person, the bibliography appended does not include this book) on the isfdb makes no mention of this, but it is rather sketchy.
