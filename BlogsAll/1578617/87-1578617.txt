         I visited the Bangalore book Fair on Sunday. Apart from realising once again that Ihave a nearly pathological aversion to crowds (my left hand kept clenching into a fist by the end of it all), I also scored some pretty good stuff:  SF:  Software - Rudy Rucker China Mountain Zhiang - Maureen F. McHugh Circuit of Heaven - Dennis Danvers Parable of the Sower - Octavia Butler Heavy Weather - Bruce Sterling Double Star - Robert Heinlein The Parasaurians â€“ Robert Wells The Alien Factor - Stan Lee  Other fiction: Father Sergius and other stories - Tolstoy Complete Stories of Dostoyevsky (For a friend)   Rock-related: Somebody to love? - Grace Slick In his own write & Spaniard in the works - John Lennon  Other stuff: The True Jihad - Maulana Wahiduddin Khan Fidel Castro on Imperialist Globalisation In Patagonia - Bruce Chatwin Socialogy - The Central Questions (For my sister, to help with her studies)  Werewolves, shapeshifters and skinshifters - Marika Kriss (For a friend)  Books I wanted to but but couldn't afford: This ginormous Batman thingy. Sort of a history of the character and all his manifestations across the media (including lunchboxes and stuff). David Gray's book on Modernity and the Al-Qaeda (can't recal the exact name). Waiting for the paperback. This really cool book on Indian myths and legends from the Ramakrishna Math - I'm sure I'll be able to get that at the local Math later.  A whole lot of Far Side omnibuses (omnibii?). I'm going to see if I can round enough money to make one more visit the Fair. If not -well, mustn't be TOO greedy...I guess...
