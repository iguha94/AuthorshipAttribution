         I used the word 'flashpoint' in a piece of copy for an event a client is holding.   I used it in the perfectly valid sense of a point at which,among other things, creation is possible.  He replies:  'What does "flashpoint" mean? Perhaps you mean a "forum"?'  So I tell him:  '  Flashpoint is the point at which eruption into significant action, creation, or violence occurs. therefore, in this case, the word refers to the meet's potential as a catalyst for ideas, opportunities or action.'  He gets back with:  'Thank you for your kind efforts to educate me. In future, when interacting with me, do not attempt to imbibe words with meanings they do not possess.       (1) Remove that word "flashpoint" from the writeup. If "forum" is what you mean, use that instead.'  At this point I loose my temper and hit him with:  'flash point also flash·point  n.   The lowest temperature at which the vapor of a combustible liquid can be made to ignite momentarily in air.  The point at which eruption into significant action, creation, or violence occurs: The shootdown did not increase international tensions to the flash point(Seymour M. Hersh).

And he comes back with:  'FYI!   flashpoint (n.)  1) the temperature at which vapour from oil, etc., will ignite in air. 2) the point at which anger, indignation, etc., becomes uncontrollable.   Source: Oxford University Press Great Clarendon Street, Oxford Revised second edition 2002.   I recommend you change your dictionary.   Pl put an end to this and revise your text.'  If he is using the OED why the fuck aren't we using UK English on his site?  Bleah.
