         The worst thing about these blasts is the fear and confusion I see people going through. My colleague who has a relative near Marine Drive was edgy and worried all of yesterday because of a not clear enough line on the Times site which said that that area was blocked up. Turns out it was just a traffic jam, and his relative is fine, but you'd think the media would want to be a little more sensitive and responsible at times like this? Another friend in the US is just psyched at the thought someone he knows may have died in the blasts. He says he feels like his hometown is turning into another Tel Aviv.  A lot of people are already cursing the ah - people of the crescent, who are probably to blame in the form of some extremist group. While I understand this anger, I also wonder if this attribution is true. One question I always ask is: who stands to gain from this? The saffron hardliners, that's who. Just a thought. Here again I'd like to criticise the TImes, who immediately attempted to tie the blasts in with the ASI report on Ayodhya, presented to the courts yesterday. While this may be the cause, it was hardly the moment to start inserting potentially inflammatory editorialising. Rediff, in contrast, was far more careful in their updates.  To anyone in Bombay, or with loved ones there, I hope you and yours are well and whole.
