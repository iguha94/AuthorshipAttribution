         Handwriting is any day better than Arial...hmmm. Have you seen  my  handwriting lately, Shenoy? Seriously, although I emotionally identify with what you're saying, I can't really agree. There's always an affection for the older way of doing things, because it has been around for so long and we've built up so many associations towards it. But every new method is an opportunity to translate those associations, to perform the same human actions in new and sometimes better ways.  The Indian Post could never have achieved the miracle of letting my friend Anand in Qatar tell me about my friend Vinod in London's wedding reception in Bangalore in time for me to contact Vinod and find out when and where.  There's the touch!   Also, I would compare your argument to one that I came across somewhere in Plato, where this person criticises the invention of writing, because it allows people to note things down, eliminating the need to consciously recall those things. He felt it would result in people using their minds less and less.  In actual fact, the development of external memory devices has only freed the human mind to use its processing power to better effect.  I've always been a science fiction fan. I really believed the world could become that way, in my lifetime.  Well, I'm still waiting for the space age to happen.  But in the meantime, the communication age is one thing that  is  happening - and it's up to us to seize the opportunity to use it the way we want to.  Got any thoughts? You can call me, mail me, sms me, or just walk into the place where I live and tell me yourself - whatever seems to be the easiest, best way to get in touch with me!
