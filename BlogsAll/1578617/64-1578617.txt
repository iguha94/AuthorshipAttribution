         Well, I'd read, a long time back, that the Icelandic Poetic Edda were a major source-work for Tolkien. Knowing something academically and seeing for yourself are two totally different things, however. A discussion on an SF Forum I sometimes inhabit inspired me to finally go take a look for myself. None of this is original at all, but I'm just tripping on finding things out for myself, humour me.  The Voluspo, or The Wise Woman's Prophecy is the most famous of all the Poetic Edda. In it. Othin/Odin calls on an ancient wise woman to prophesise the future for him. First, she tells him an account of various existing events to prove her wisdom. Having done this, Othin rewards her and she proceeds withthe actual prophecy, which ends on a rather Christian note, probably a later interpolation. The passage in question is:  65.  There comes on high, | all power to hold, A mighty lord, | all lands he rules.   Which, in some versions, includes the lines:   "Rule he orders, | and rights he fixes, Laws he ordains | that ever shall live."   These lines are of doubtful origin, but suggest a subliminal mesage about the unstoppable progress of Christianity. Many old texts, like Beowulf, have such passages, usually bunged in by mediaevel monks who were probably torn between wanting to preserve old tales which were part of their cultural heritage, and making them synch with the religion they now followed.   Getting back to Tolkien, the earlier part of the poem deals, among other things, with the origin of the dwarves and at this point includes a catalogue of dwarven names, supposedly also a later interpolation, which goes like this:  9.  Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats, The holy ones, | and council held, To find who should raise | the race of dwarfs Out of Brimir's blood | and the legs of Blain.   10.  There was Motsognir | the mightiest made Of all the dwarfs, | and Durin next; Many a likeness | of men they made, The dwarfs in the earth, | as Durin said.   11.  Nyi and Nithi, | Northri and Suthri, Austri and Vestri, | Althjof, Dvalin, Nar and Nain, | Niping, Dain, Bifur, Bofur, | Bombur, Nori, An and Onar, | Ai, Mjothvitnir.   12.  Vigg and Gandalf) | Vindalf, Thrain, Thekk and Thorin, | Thror, Vit and Lit, Nyr and Nyrath,-- | now have I told-- Regin and Rathsvith-- | the list aright.   13.  Fili, Kili, | Fundin, Nali, Heptifili, | Hannar, Sviur, Frar, Hornbori, | FrÃ¦g and Loni, Aurvang, Jari, | Eikinskjaldi.   14.  The race of the dwarfs | in Dvalin's throng Down to Lofar | the list must I tell; The rocks they left, | and through wet lands They sought a home | in the fields of sand.   15.  There were Draupnir | and Dolgthrasir, Hor, Haugspori, | Hlevang, Gloin, Dori, Ori, | Duf, Andvari, Skirfir, Virfir, | Skafith, Ai.   16.  Alf and Yngvi, | Eikinskjaldi, Fjalar and Frosti, | Fith and Ginnar; So for all time | shall the tale be known, The list of all | the forbears of Lofar.   Lots of old friends there! Interestingly, the name Gandalf is also taken from here, and means 'Magic-Elf' in the original. So now I know.  I believe the Edda also include references to the Path of the Dead - I'll look out for these next.   PS:  try reading those lists of names aloud. Roll them over your tongue, savour each syllable. It's an amazing experience. Don't do it in public, though!
