         Writing owes its origin to commerce.  Initially, our pre-literate ancestors would not have needed script - since they were limited to just that quantity of verbal information that can be stored by the human brain, they would have had no behaviours that required a larger memory. At first.  But once society evolved beyond a certain size, and a merchant class began to emerge, things changed.  Suddenly a need for measurable value emerged. Common systems of measurement seemed like a good idea. And then, the merchants needed some way to keep track of all their transactions.   This lead to the development of standardised units of measurement, the introduction of money and some way to keep track of it all.  It started with crude inscriptions scratched onto clay slabs. Simultaneously, the merchants (or their scribes) would have developed symbols to represent the different goods being traded. More symbols for the different people they dealt with. Sill more symbols for time, place, season, year...you know the rest. These odd markings that you create on paper, on computer screens, on billboards, in magazines.   Script, ladies and gentlemen - writing!  Runes and hieroglyphs, cuneiform and minuscules, alphabet and akshar.   And all because a few people wanted to sell things to may other people, and make sense of it all.  Al of which makes it kind of preposterous to sit around here as I often do and crib about having to use writing to aid commerce. Oh well, I never said I wasn't going to be a preposterous man...
