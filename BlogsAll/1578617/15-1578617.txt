         Somewhere in Ken MacLeod's Cosmonaut Keep, one of the two protagonists (his surname is Cairns - both their surnames are Cairns - and at this point I can't recall which was which) describes software project management as being akin to herding cats.  If you've ever been owned by a cat, you'll know what he meant.  I would like to extend that analogy to web development team management. I've found myself in a lot of odd situations in life (bassist for a death metal band, writer lost in an event management company, left-handed atheist in a largely right-handed, theist society and on and on) but this has to be the oddest. I'm currently apparently co-ordinating the total re-vamping of my company's website. Believe, this needs to be done.  It's a web communication/technology company, and the team I have to work with includes a mix of techies, designers, management, and IA types, so as to reflect all the aspects of our business and to actually get all aspects of the job done.  It's a juggling act and a roller-coaster ride rolled into one. It's like herding cats and dogs simultaneously and a herd of pissed-off, underpaid underfed maths teachers and all their squabbling, screaming 11-year old students at the same time.   My only option is to dig down deep and kick serious booty. Today, after a week and a half of getting ground-level inputs from everyone, I held the first actual action meeting.  We covered a whole lot of ground and have actually emerged with a plan and concrete actions to be taken, which is still slightly miraculous to me.  And of course we all have our ongoing actual work for our clients to contend with at the same time.  And I have Scylla and Charybdis to deal with - two deceptively small-seeming projects that have been entirely placed on my narrow, quavering shoulders.  If all this goes through succesfully, I think I'm going to apply for that job herding cats.  Interested?  Drop me a line!
