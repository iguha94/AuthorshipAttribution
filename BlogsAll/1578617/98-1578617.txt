         Leaving aside the Americana, these excerpts from the testimony to be given by Planetary Society leaders to Congress sometime today are quite interesting and even inspiring:  Dr. Murray will comment "Mars is the true space frontier; it is the legitimate abode for the dreams of the young for many generations to come. Thus, America should lead the world in that grand, positive human endeavor. We can use some of our enormous and visible technological capability to dramatically demonstrate our commitment to Earth's future beyond the blood and conflict which inevitably will color much of the 21st century."   Dr. Wesley T. Huntress Jr., President of The Planetary Society   Dr. Huntress will say, "The human space flight program is marching into a blind alley, stuck in Earth orbit with an expensive, complex and risky infrastructure not designed to support destinations beyond Earth orbit. We need to establish Mars as a destination for human space flight in the next 50 years; retire the Shuttle in favor of a simpler, less risky and less costly system; limit the Space Station to research on human physiology in space; and devise a new architecture to establish a permanent human presence in deep space."  I think Asimov or Clarke were in favour of a moonbase first, though, and I'm not sure which would be better. Perhaps the impetus of a whole new planet is what we need at this point rather than something so much closer home.   This is all obvously in response to the   taikonaut affair,  but I don't mind if it results in a shot in the arm to humanity's now-moribund march to the space age.
