         Yesterday I picked up two very different items both of which are sending me down those alleys of remembering.   The first is a slim volume, published by the Hesperus Press, containing a piece called 'Eureka', written by Edgar Allan Poe. I pretty much snatched it up without even reading the blurbs and so forth, because Poe is a very old favourite (read an abridged version containing Usher, Amontillado, Tell-Tale and The Gold Bug when I was 6, got hold of the real thing a year later, loved it immensely, still do). As I strolled away from the shop, I had the time to look at the cover, notice that the book had a preface by astronomer Patrick Moore. Apparently, it's an essay, written shortly before Poe's death, which attempts to fathom the physical and metaphysical nature of the cosmos. Moore clams that many statements and ideas in the book are startlingly similar to the more disorienting notions of 20th century science. The essay itself is classic non-fiction Poe. I'm still reading it, but I can say that his magisterial dismissal of both a priori and a posteriori logic is already one of the best things I've read in a while.  The other find was the deluxe edition of Sonic Youth's Dirty. This was among my first ever CDs, nearly a decade back, and the first to be stolen from me. It's good to have a vital part of my musical education back - and with a whole extra CD's worth of new material, too! Now I need to get hold of the rest of their catalogue on CD (especially Washing Machine), but at least I've made a beginning.
