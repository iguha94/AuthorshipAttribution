         Shenoy one point - I am not saying people who use drugs cannot use their imagination.  Nor do I deny that Tolkien or Einstein used tobacco, itself the most pervasive narcotic in human society.  I do want to say that it is perfectly possible to reach those heights of inspiration without drugs. So, to identify the creative process with substance use is wrong. Those indiviudals would have found some way to express it anyhway, because it was in them. To give too much credit to the drug is the same as claiming that it was Judas Priest's music that drove those teenagers to kill themselves. Fair enough?  Also, I continue to believe (fine, BELIEVE) that if you consistently turn to something that aritificially alters your mind, you are either nor very happy with the overall state of your mind, or not really in touch with it. Think about people we both know who habitually get drunk or stoned. I think it fits. Do you?  Also, drugs are just not the only or best tool to expand your mind. Here I am in direct contradiction with Shenoy.   I will continue to insist that we can do this ourselves even with the time and so on available to us in this shoddy world we have built. I can - I do - so can you.  Finally, if any of us are going to use any of these things, let's do two things - always bear in mind WHY - whether it is just for relaxation/enjoyment or to explore a mental space. And the second thing is, first EDUCATE yourself. Learn what this substance can do - don't just visit Deoxy or Erowid or all the pro-narc sites, checkout the opposing views as well, get that balance and then decide. This of course is aimed partly at us and partly at people who are only just getting into these things.
