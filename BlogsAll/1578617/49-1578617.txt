         Well, for the first time ever, I've put up a response to a story I liked and gotten a response to my response from the writer. I love the Internet. (hugs terminal fondly. ceases upon noticing bemused looks on colleague's faces).  The story in question is   Douglas Lain's 'The '84 Regress' , published on the Infinite Matrix. That site allows you to post reponses, so I posted mine:   'I really enjoyed the story! I especially loved the bit about the teenage kid selling pills that can take you to the sort of future that SHOULD have happened (Art Deco cars...I want my Art Deco cars. Preferably with aerial capabilities!) I grew up in the 80s but I pretty much ignored them...still, a few nostalgic resonances were thrown up.'   Well, I generally tend to spew my 2 annas worth all over the Net without really expecting a response. So I was quite thrilled to discover, a few weeks later, this response from Mr. Lain hisself:   'I'm glad you liked it.  These days I'm nostalgic for the future most of the time.  Art Deco cars will be arriving just as soon as Apple Computers start making cars.'   I'm fairly certain its him, by the way. The associated e-mail ID is the same as the one on his own homepage. Not an earth-shattering exchange of correspondance, but it's kinda nice to be able to let someone know you liked their work, and also nice to know that they appreciate your opinion. Okay, I'm ending this before I use the word 'nice' again...oops, I just did...
