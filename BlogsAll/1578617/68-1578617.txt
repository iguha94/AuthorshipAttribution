         Alessandro Moreschi was the last castrato. The castrati were singers who were castrated as young boys to preserve their high-pitched singing voices. This was done because tradition forbid the inclusion of women in religious choirs. By the end of the 19th century, this tradition was banned as barbaric. But not before Moreschi's were chopped off. Ouch. Another sad victim of history, Moreschi was known as 'the angel of Rome' in his time.  Of particular interest is the fact that Moreschi survived into the early 20th century, into the dawn if the era of sound capture technology, and was the subject of an early recording, made in 1904. I found a few clips from the album, commonly marketed under the title 'The Last Castrato'. and checked out Moreschi's rendiiton of Gounod's 'Ave Maria'. Being a song that was written only about a century and a half back, and one that I've heard many versions of (including one by Chris Cornell, back in the Napster days) I expected that this would be a fairly familiar starting point.  I couldn't have been more wrong. Moreschi's voice soars and swoops like a raw primal scream, to use Nicholas Cook's phrase, a scream modulated acoording to a melodic sensibility that is as alien to the modern performances of this song as, for example, Jazz scatting or Carantic konnakal vocals are to the Western classical vocal traditional itself. The closest comparison, in my experience, is to Janis Joplin's often painfully emotion-charged voice.   This brings me back to my earlier question of what it is in music, then, that we consider enduring. Perhaps it isn't music itself but our own attitudes to and engagement with the art that are the enduring factor. Something like how ideals of beauty may vary over the years, but the quest for beauty as a value is constant, however each era and each individual may define it.  One last thought: Mozart makes Dream Theater sound like Limp Bizkit.
