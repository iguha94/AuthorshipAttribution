         For reasons too mundane to mention, I was desperately trawling the net for negative effects of tea drinking.   The only thing worth mentioning was this:  Anti-Tea This is an anti-tea poem that was published in several American newspapers shortly before the American Revolution  A Lady's Adieu to Her Tea-Table   FAREWELL the Tea-board with your gaudy attire,  Ye cups and ye saucers that I did admire;  To my cream pot and tongs I now bid adieu;  That pleasure's all fled that I once found in you.  Farewell pretty chest that so lately did shine,  With hyson and congo and best double fine;  Many a sweet moment by you I have sat,  Hearing girls and old maids to tattle and chat;  And the spruce coxcomb laugh at nothing at all,  Only some silly work that might happen to fall.  No more shall my teapot so generous be  In filling the cups with this pernicious tea,  For I'll fill it with water and drink out the same,  Before I'll lose LIBERTY that dearest name,  Because I am taught (and believe it is fact)  That our ruin is aimed at in the late act,  Of imposing a duty on all foreign Teas,  Which detestable stuff we can quit when we please.  LIBERTY'S The Goddess that I do adore,  And I'll maintain her right until my last hour,  Before she shall part I will die in the cause,  For I'll never be govern'd by tyranny's laws   PS: Personally I favour tea. Heck, part of my family's fortune (largely squandered though it may be, and not by me, sadly) was created by the tea plantations we once owned.
