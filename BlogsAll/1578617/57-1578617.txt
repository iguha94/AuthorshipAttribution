         i've been in bed for three weeks now, nursing a throbbing left leg. my only way of covering ground is by clomping about on lightweight aluminium-frame crutches. at times i can try and swing on them, keeping rhythm in my armpits, but this metal bar bolted inside my leg keeps pinching me for attention. got my chance to head outside of home once last week, with a doctor's appointment. and that proved to be a chance to ride the roads with a friendly rickshaw rider - an experience very rare in any city. he responded calmly to my pleas for a slow and steady ride, and immediately rode down to a cruise, with a faint fluttering hum that seemed to come from directly under my bum. these rear-engine versions are pretty comfortable i thought, and he began a conversation. to my un-celebratory chagrin, he mentions the bollywood star who has broken a leg too, and laughs bursting into a song - one of those with meaningful words, thankfully. so i peacefully got all the stitches and staples removed from my leg, and headed on for a night with the boys. strong painkillers don't work as good.  a few days later, while i sat rueing over lost ground in time, gently rubbing the healing wounds, and generally deploring orthopaedic professionals, something sprouted unexpectedly.  the tip of a nylon thread, well-knotted, and hard with dried blood. the violet-coloured little thing had arisen from under the hide on my knee, to even suggest colourful surgical implementation.  while i sat bewildered and blankly bemused by it, frantic calls by my folks to the doc confirmed this was nothing to worry about, seriously. and i could double the painkillers if i want to. the string has been bathed and cleaned now, and the frayed fibres rub softly. once it was made clear that this was a mistake, the doc hastily confided in regular 'only human' talk. routine affair. run along. even we have a sense of irony.
