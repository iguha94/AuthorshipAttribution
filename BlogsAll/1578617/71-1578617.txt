         Earlier this year, some friends and me were driving home late after a night on the pub. My friend was playing a CD of a female singer doing what seemed like largely jazz standards. The song 'Autumn Leaves' came up, and I was utterly mesmerised by the singer's rendition of this old chestnut (ok, fine, 'standard'), and it was more than just the happy receptive buzz engendered by a night of beer and herbs. I'd heard a few of the current female jazz singers - Diana Kroll and, more loosely, Norah Jones. None of them had blown me away quite like this.  'Who is she?' I asked my friend. 'Eva Cassidy.' he replied. 'Who's that? What else has she done?' She was a singer, she only came up in the 90s. She died while recording her last album.' I was stunned. Her voice was so full of warmth and life, I could hardly imagine that singer may no longer be among the livng. A day later, my friend gave me a collection of her songs, and I've often listened to and enjoyed the cd over the months, even though this isn't my usual musical trip. She just cuts through pre-conceptions, mixing jazz, blues, folk and more into a rich blend.  She's done the best cover of Sting I've ever heard - Fields of Gold. Sting is a nororiously hard artist to cover - like the Beatles, and for the same reasons - brilliant, uncompromising songwriting coupled with just-right performances that are well-nigh impossible to equal let alone surpass. Eva equaled. She surpassed. And how. I've finally managed to go out on the net and find a few links about her. These two are the best I have found - treat them as a starting point for a beautiful musical journey, if you haven't heard her.   Who Was Eva Cassidy?    The Official Site
