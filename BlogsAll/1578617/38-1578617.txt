         erhhh...today I was down with a sudden stomach upset. Very shitty day.  On the bright side, I picked up the issue of That Glossy Mag which included my anti-dj article, 'Whatever Happened To Humanity?'   I realise I disagree now with some of the points I made in that article. Specifically, I'd contended that electronic music technology makes it easier for people with no actual traditional music skills to create something approximating music. Actually, that's true, but it doesn't mean that this technology is any less valid than good old musical instruments. A true artist will make use of any tool at hand to create.   I guess the point I should have made is that it's easy to get carried away with the dj thing because it's now and it's fresh, but even so, the same standards that apply to any other kind of music must be used in assessing this music as well.   When it comes to that, there are as few really important or interesting things happening in the dj scene as there are in rock. Still, rock has been around fora while, and declared dead with unfailing regularity. It's also done the resurrection thing with the same regularity, so it's important not to treat rock music as a closed book - there are exciting sounds kicking around the edges, and a phoenix act may well be on its way.   At least, I hope so...
