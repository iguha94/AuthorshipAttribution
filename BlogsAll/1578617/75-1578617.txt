         good thing i'm only human. i can always learn from animals.  it's hard enough (and inhuman) trying to gain an education at the mercy of brutes and beasts. if only for the sake of a peaceful alternative, animals (that don't speak english too well) must be projected to instructor levels - so they teach what they do, we learn what we can, and there is no room for objections (however sensible they claim to be). trees and the breeze teach simple lessons too, but they can get boring, going on and on about the same things, even putting me to sleep easily. (but of course, as for my involvement in any kind of educational session, i must consciously pay more attention, and learn to absorb quietly.) animals have all kinds of lessons to teach. while the domesticated types tend to keep their stories to themselves, and probably save their tales to share in intimate moments, the wilder kinds hardly care about who isn't listening. they can go about their courses with such ease, like the world were meant to be listening. and then there are all the animals that moved to the cities, adapting to modern life with simplistic country-hardened wisdom. these animals form the most interesting and inspiring category. there are all kinds of lessons to pick up from them. be it about survival skills, housing techniques, conservation methods, and even for mating proficiency. an article on nature dot com observed that birds in the city are beginning to chirp much louder than their cousins in the country. their need to be heard over the din of modern life has led them to cry out that much harder.  we were in jp nagar just before sundown a few evenings back, in a sprawling park facing a friend's home, and the chirping of birds reached such a level it completely doused all conversation. at first we were forced to scream in order to be heard, but the chirping from high up in the many trees around compelled us to just sit quiet and listen. and appreciate.
