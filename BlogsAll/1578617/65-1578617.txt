         Another work-in-progress. Remember, you saw it here first!!!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Henry T. Lee was a troubled man. As Commander In Chief and President In Perpetuity of The Greater Americana, he was, really and truly, what old Alek Sikander, Iolious Kaisar, Charly Maimed, Donald Duck-Egan and Zhiuko Phat before him had only aspired to be - he was The Most Powerful Man In The World. And what a world! A terraformed, cleaned up, sorted out, rationalized, tamed, optimized, New And Improved Gaia. Dolphins frolicked in the gracious canals, gengineered 'dactlys soared in the skies, lumbering mammoths paced the majestic highways and the broad avenues, all in service of Humanity Triumphant. Clean, non-polluting Aircars and Hoverbikes provided speedier transport when it was needed. A happy, prosperous and privileged populace disported itself with dignified gaiety, secure in the knowledge that their once-in-a-lifetime three-year Indentures in the sparklng, sleek Manufactories safely tucked away in Earth Orbit and on Mars (Luna was reserved as a resort for honeymooners and lovers, a sort of Cythera-in-the-Sky) were enough to ensure that the wheels of production kept turning. For those who were more ambitious, or driven, secure niches in Administration, Research or Entertainment could be had for the asking.  But there was one thorn in President Leeâ€™s side, one single serpent - mole, rather - in his Eden. One glitch in his otherwise elegant, unblemished worldcode. One flashpoint of dangerous dissent, arrogant errantry and contemptible contrarianism. He had launched a hundred - no, a thousand - schemes to wipe this irritation off the face of his domain. Sneak attacks, infiltration, siege, even one ill-advised attempt at head-on confrontation that it had taken his crack Goeringspin Docs an entire decade to completely hush up.   The problem was largely one of scale.   His own vantage point was so lofty, his machinery so monumental, that that old bugbear of empiricism, or indeed imperialism, The Uncertainty Principle, came into play. Or, to use an archaic conceit that it often amused President Lee to employ, it is easy enough to swat a fly if you are a little monkey - harder for a Homo Sap - virtually impossible for a ponderous old pachyderm.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    To be continued...
