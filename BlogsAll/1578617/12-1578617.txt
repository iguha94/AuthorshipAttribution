         to all fRiends, If the world was truly perfect (and it is not) and if everyone was the same (and they are not), the world would truly be a boring place. If i was the same as you and you were a copy of me, wouldn't that be just decay in all spheres? If you had nothing to give me and i you (in actual presence and in the realm of thought and ideas), we would never be together. If you did not make me think, i would not respect you. But you do help expand my mind, so i respect you. That is why you are my friend.  It has always been one of man's oldest attributes that he wants to be the best; breaking your own boundaries is not trespassing into another's territory (or is it?). Rest assured, my friend.  And if I was sure of thee, sure of thy capacity, sure to match my mood with thine, I should never think again of trifles in relation to thy comings and goings. I am not very wise: my moods quite attainable: my demands reasonable, and I acknowledge and respect thy genius, and it is to me as yet unfathomed. Yet dare I not (or do i not have the liberty to) presume in thee a perfect intelligence of me, and so thou art to me a delicious torment. For, if there was no friction, never would a fire be. Or would you rather i be your yes-man, and nod my head sagely to all of your views and opinions. Would you still be my friend, still respect me, if was in agreement to all you said with no mind of my own? But i do have one. And so do you. Going back, we are not the same (similar maybe), but not the same. And that is what will keep us going.   with due apologies to mr.emerson
