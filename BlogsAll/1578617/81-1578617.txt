         Yesterday, I had to edit the profiles of the top management of one of my clients - all 21 of them. Apart from the usual professional overview, all these profiles have a little 'human touch ' towards the end - 'he loves classical music', 'his father inspires him' or 'he collects boarding passes'. You get the idea. The whole process took me two hours, extending a normal work day up to 9.30 PM.   I went home dead tired, crawled into bed without even taking my boots off and fell asleep. That's when the dream happened....  I am in Styx, one of my regular pubs, with the Gang of 21. They're decked out in tight jeans and 80s glam t-shirts which look extremely odd on their flabby middle-aged bods. They all have vivid red bandanas ties on to conceal receding hairlines. They are repeatedly requesting Guns n' Roses' 'Sweet child of mine', singing along raucously, waving lighters, spilling beer and hitting on passing girls. Every now and then one of them raises a toast to me. These are always tequila shots, for some odd reason.   After about an hour or so of this, the bartender, Basha walks up to me, takes me aside. He has a serious look in his eyes.  'JP,' he says to me, 'We don't mind you, but you have to stop bringing these kids here...'  At this point, I woke up shivering.
