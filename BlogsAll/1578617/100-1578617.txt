         A review of Phillip K Dick's Time Out Of Joint  Before I get into the plot, I'd like to point out how well written this book is. In the opening sequence, PKD sketches out the characters of the main players - Rigle Gumm, his sister Margo and brother in law Vic and their neighbours, the Blacks, with amazing vividity and economy.A few sentances is all he needs to make them real. Similarly, this book captures his ear for crisp, convincing dialogue. The economy of his writing again comes out in the fact that, even though he barely sketches in most of his settings, they are quite real in the reader's mental eye.   The plot centers around Ragle Gumm, WW2 vet, who lives with his sister's family, makes a lot of money solving newspaper puzzles and flirts with his neighbours wife. But there are subtle discrepancies. He sometimes sees objects vanishing. A radio his nephew makes enables him to listen to mysterious conversations,including one about him. He finds an old magazine which mentions a famous actress called Marilyn Monroe - but he's never heard of her. He finds an entire telephone directory full of numbers that don't even seem to exist. Perhaps he's just paranoid, cracking up? The truth is far stranger.   PKD masterfully explores the process by which the reality behind Gumm's oddly neat and tidy world is discovered -the conflict in Gumm's mind between the unfolding realisation, and the fear that perhaps he is just going mad.   The revelation, when it happens is fairly unexpected and satisfying. I won't go into the details, but it's about space - where we SHOULD be going, but apparently many people disagree.   So, this is a well-written, rewarding book. Not an absolute classic, but not one that's just for the PKD fans either. I wonder if the makers of The Truman Show ever read this book.
