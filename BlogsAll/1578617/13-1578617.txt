         I recently had (and am probably still having) an interesting debate with a friend over whether or not Metallica's Load could be included in a list of 'essential' Metallica albums. I felt it should, he didn't.  At that point, I defined the bifurcation of our views by contending that his definition of 'essential' was a qualitative one, a sort of 'best of', while mine was a hollistic one, an attempt to provide a complete snapshot covering every aspect of the band's evolution. Actually, I've realised it goes a little deeper than that. The difference is actually between our perceptions of what Metallica the band itself is. My friend's point of view probably comes from the generic perspective, placing Metallica squarely in the metal tradition and assessing their output by the standards of that genre.  My own perspective is coloured by the realisation that human creativity often goes through radical shifts in its expression even by a single person (or collective entity)- witness Picasso's various periods, for instance.  Further, an entity such as a succesfull rock band also has to deal with its relation to a constantly shifting context of trends and styles, the ever-morphing pop-culture tapestry, and the need for a vital, growing audience.  Metallica's history over the past decade is a fascinating study in the re-invention process and offers important insights into the complex, paradoxical dynamics by which a popular art form like heavy metal evolves.  The new album, St. Anger, although personally dissapointing, is also an 'essential' part of assessing Metallica from such a perspective.  In fact, apart from Re-Load, which can be seen as an extension of Load, all of Metallica's releases in the last decade or so - the Black Album, Load, Garage Days Re-Revisited, S&M and finally St. Anger, all mark interesting transition points and cannot be ignored in any serious attempt to understand the band.  More later - it's a Sunday, y'know!
