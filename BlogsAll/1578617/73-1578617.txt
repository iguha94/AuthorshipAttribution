         You came into town on the water wagon  Stuck a feather in your cap and set your tongue a-wagging You stalked into the pub and got to bragging It's dragging us all down can't you leave this town?  Now you're spinning on the whirling carousel  The worldwide market bears the tales you sell Now you're winning because Dame Fortune loves you well She'll feel you up and fuck you up can't you tell?   Dyslexic acid diethylamide coursing through your synapses You stutter, stutter, strut Walk the walk and squawk to talk, shack up with your squaw It's common law, broke your jaw   Whispers among the homeless and screams from on high Your highness sells them a ticket to the sky Marrow for the boneless and smiles from the sly You'll bring them low but they'll watch you die   Dyslexic acid diethylamide coursing through your synapses You stutter, stutter, strut Walk the walk and squawk to talk, shack up with your squaw It's common law, broke your jaw   Marketplace heart attack you're hard of hearing now Lost your friends your soul to spend you don't know how You crawl into the gutter and get to bragging It's dragging us all down can't you leave this town?   Dyslexic acid diethylamide coursing through your synapses You stutter, stutter, strut Walk the walk and squawk to talk, shack up with your squaw It's common law, broke your jaw
