         Light can travel faster than light, apparently, but information cannot. This preserves the chain of causality as we know it, and does no damage to Einstein's assertion that information (defined as any signal that can effect an object or device) cannot exceed the speed of light (c).  Apparently, however, some photons actually can exceed c in certain conditions. One of the conditions under which this can happen is what the boffins call 'gain-assisted linear anomalous dispersion to demonstrate superluminal light propagation in atomic caesium gas'. However, this occurence can be brought on only in specific conditions, in what they call fast-light mediums (there are a few other ways in which photons can be made to exceed c, but except the one just mentioned they seem to create distortions in the light pulses which corrupt the information content). This research had not real implication for projects dear to SF fan like me, such as FTL or time travel, but it did suggest that Information could be transmitted at superluminal speeds. New research published in this week's Nature however, seems to suggest this too is not a possibility.  Apparently, while some photons may exceed c, information does not. The exact reason doesn't seem to be known yet, but researchers have just found that the time to detect information propagating through a fast-light medium is slightly longer than the time required to detect the same information travelling through a vacuum. So relativistic causality is safe. For the time being, anyhow.    Detection rescues cause and effect : The Nature article about this new research, with links to abstracts of relevant papers.
