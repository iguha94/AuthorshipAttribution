         It's getting along reasonably well, I think. Yesterday, I manged to keep off most of the day. However, I copped a couple of drags off a friend at around 6.30 pm. I find it's a little hard to resist a smoke when I'm sitting around in a cafe - the whole setting has become a deeply ingrained context for lighting up. So that's something to keep in mind. Sunday I chickened out totally and bought a cigarette. Then I chucked it away after two drags. Through the day I've taken a couple of drags from friends' cigarettes - I need to be a little more careful about that.   Physical effects seem insignificant as yet - no constipation or anything, but there is a mild feeling of acidity which may not be related. More than anything else, I'm beginning to realise how smoking had become a tool for spending and even allocating time, and also a way to partially distance myself from a lot of things - a smokescreen in every sense of the word. That will be the hardest to deal with.   Still, I figure I should be able to kick this. After all, I've been able to drastically cut down both alcohol and sweet leaf. In fact, I think I've more or less stopped actively wanting to drink - instead, as and when friends decide to have a drink, I either join them or not. I've even said no to a spliff many times in the recent past. All this is just an attempt to re-assure myself that I can do this. Well, that's enough of that for now.
