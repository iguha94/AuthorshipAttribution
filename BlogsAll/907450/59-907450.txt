hey everyone sorry i haven't been around the house, busy and all, plus extremely tired lately. The tori show was soooooooooo great, she is a brilliant musician....some people just get all the talent. When you can play two instraments and sing at the same time, thats something special. Lord of the Rings was always really good. Not reading the book I really don't have anything to compare it with. Some parts were a little cheesy but overall its still great. Saw the preview for T3, it looks cool, but to me it doesn't seem like the previous eps, probably because of no james cameron. Not top 10 lists up yet, still going over my options, it will probably be a top 5 list. Golden globes came out today, good to see adam sandler get a nod for his quirky character in punch drunk love. some nods i'm a little more concerned about....(i.e. the greek wedding and unfaithful...i was told they both sucked, but whatevers to that)......gangs of new york comes out tommorrow, looks awesome.....i liked your new wave impression hedwig that was funny.....hahha.......i guess i should start my shopping now, i'm really bad cause of all my procrastination....oh well, i guess i'll have to endure the masses this weekend....sigh.......has anyone else caught any of VH1's I love the 80s series this week, it has brought back som many memories i don't even know where to begin...o.g. wwf, small wonder, smurfs, atari, just to mention a few and tonight ALF!!!!! man the 80s were weird....haha.......okay i shall return to the house soon.
