so tired .. work is trying to kill me i'm sure of it now.  um random index card-sized ads of bands are pretty cool and yes i used cool ... isn't that so undeck of me. ha ha (go read the hipster handbook)  ohhh hedwig cheap is always good ... not sure i'm vibing with you on the john mayer. he sounds like dave matthews and they are so much better than john ha ha. all of john's songs sound exactly the same ... just my thought but cool about the periodic table, that's always neat.  as for the friend advice thanks to all, i'm not sure what we are going to do, i'll just ride it out ... oh and dorkus seriously that "rock your body" by justin timberlake is awful. ha ha no really and what is up with the video. okay it is offical the 1980's are back ... and don't get me started on good charlotte "the anthem" i think i'm going to be sick .... (barfing) man if this is what music is on mtv then please can i be disconnected ...  hey just a random thought for the guys ... do dumb girls turn you on more than smart ones. i mean do you guys like to look for dumb girls because you know they are easy and aren't smarter than you so they will bruise your precious ego. ha ha just a wonder ....   on the beat box:  out of this world - the cure ... :)
