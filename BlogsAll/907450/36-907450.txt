all this talk about "real" fans of the music and bandwagon sports people is getting OLD .... so i think we should just move on ..... however if anyone wants to continue the discussion by all means do .......  i really really hope you make a super duper great med school hedwig potter. you have worked your ass off and you deserve to go somewhere good :) also, if i have any menopause questions i'll make sure to go your way ha ha ...  hmmm didn't do too much this weekend, just saw red dragon and i think everyone should see it. warning: it is pretty creepy/scary but still very very worth it. of course it is no where near as good as silence of the lamb but much better than hannibal. red dragon followed more the movie format of silence and that's what is great about it.   kinda of old random thought: so i was reading my rolling stone (issue 907, oct. 17) and was so pissed off at the reader's poll 100 greatest albums of all time (if you have a lot of free time you can go through the whole list   Click Here ) ........... so FU*KING STUPID ...... just see what the stupid readers thought was the 100 GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME ..... so lame. at least the top 10 was decent .... oh well ........ ack   music to my ears:  april tenth - garbage (FTC, it is growing on me :P)
