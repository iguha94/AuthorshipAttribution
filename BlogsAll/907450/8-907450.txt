how many emo kids does it take to screw in a light bulb? my answer would be D ........ big time hate the emo kids with their striped shirts and their hearts on their sleeves ....... and the sad, very, very sad truth of the matter is i use to really like dashboard confessional. like truly liked them ......... of course that never lasted because there is only one great and wonderful band and their name is (drum roll) THE CURE. okay how many of you guys saw that coming.  can't imagine going to the warped tour since 1997 ........ boggles the mind  the new red hot chili peppers cd got 4 stars in rolling stones ..... at the same time they did an article about dashboard confessional and entitled it ...... "King of Pain" ..... it states chris c. likes to drink coffee and have a muffin in the morning .... and for lunch and dinner - a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, so that is how he stays so short ......  why is it that once a band/groups gets big you want to hate them but at the same time you are happy for them because they are making money and does it really take away from the quality of their music and shouldn't artist try to change their sounds, we wouldn't want the same repetitive albums over and over and over ........ so where do you draw the line ...... eh (shurg my shoulders)   oh i changed my name if anyone cares or in case you could not figure who this was.
