OH YEA FRIDAY THE 13TH ....... SWEET DEAL :)  i had this interesting chat with my coworker yesterday and i asked him to name me one really truly good band, you know the types that influence other bands to do what they do, that has come out since 1995 ........ keep in mind they started their career in 1995 or at least making music and the likes, not they got big or whatevers in 1995 ....... we were both drawing blanks ...... i'm sorry but all the good stuff happened in 1979 aka the creation of the Cure ... ha ha okay but seriously people can anyone mention a band ...... here are a few for me:   travis  - never really reached commerical success in the US  sigur ros  - see above  doves  - see above and they are under the radar  mum  - see above   belle and sebastian  - see above  sleater kinney  - actually here is a group that could influence other bands to be something ........  saves the day  - band members changed too many times so not really original anymore and they are too "indie" to get big but hey look at dashboard confessional  and i'm sure there are others but i have work tomorrow so i need sleep, why the heck am i even awake still. man i'm strange  music to my ears: motownphilly - boyz II men (i heard that on 92.3 today and got major flashbacks ...... i love that song)
