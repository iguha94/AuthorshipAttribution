so many random thoughts in head ......  hey cheebo welcome to the house, remember to play nice .... well not with dorkus melorkus ha ha.  as for the music thing ... i agree with darth AND dorkus, they both give some good points. after all these people are out there to make their music heard even if it is to the yucky masses who follow whatever is trendy i.e. the swing/big band phase ..... man people were all over that one. yea it would be nice for them to stay small but at the same time i would feel bad that their music was not reaching a larger audience. in a sense if their stuff can drown out the horrible horrible crap on KIIS FM then maybe the world could be a better place ..... ha ha nah i doubt it. my thing is what i mentioned to dorkus before - you are a true fan when you liked them when they were a nobody, a somebody and then a has been. or you could always love the Cure hee hee cause they are a somebody to EVERYONE ...... (sigh) how can i write about music and not once mention the greatest band ever !!!!!!!  as for avril levignes ... yes she bugs, have you heard her skater song about some boy ..... simply awful, but if she is willing to beat the living day lights out of britney then all i have to say to her is ... O Canada O Canada.  this part is for nick edney - after some thought mr. bra and panties boy is pretty messed up for making that "bet" with you. i hope it was his lack of sleep and judgement that caused him to say that. who says crap like that ...... honestly now. especially after never having met the person. sheesh. oh well people can be so strange.  where are reel beet and candy cane >>>>> where in the house are you guys hiding????  music to my ears: no distance left to run - blur (this song use to have a lot of meaning to me a year ago and now listening to it i don't feel the same way anymore. funny how songs do that to you, they remind you of a point of time and place you were at in your life.)
