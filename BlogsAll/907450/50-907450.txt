oh, i'm so happy that the blog house is full of people. yay. (note imood) anyway, i agree with you slut. why are we off to fight another war? our nation is suffering and we have to go try to "help" others. i remember one of my professors said that our country tends to think it's the american way or no way but that's a really arrogant attitude. because our country has its own set of problems. for example, the number of deaths caused by guns. we have over 10,000 gun-related deaths but some countries have just a few hundred (according to 'bowling for columbine'). i'm still complaining even though i didn't vote. hah hah. but seriously, i will vote for the next presidential election. i will make sure of it. alright, so i have been noticing more and more liberal stickers on cars. examples include "no more bushit" and "waiting for 2004." interesting... maybe this conservative tide will turn. soon soon soon. so i agree with new wave: i am too old for these emo punk shows. i mean i could ignore the little high schoolers but i feel out of place. can't relate to math class and senior class photos you know? on an embarassing note, a rep from SPIN came to the office today to make a presentation and one of her slides had a pic of Travis. so i pointed out to one of my coworkers that Fran Healy (the lead singer) is cute. and the rep heard me and said, "oh, this girl likes him eh? he is cute." and all my coworkers turned to look at me. so embarassing. i turned bright red. that rep must have super good hearing.
