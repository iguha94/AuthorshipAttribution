hi everyone. i just got back from wild bill's with new wave, darth, nick, etc. it was... interesting. semi-entertaining. i feel really sick from the food though, which was served in buckets. it's weird, they don't even try to make it appetizing. they just pile on the food and expect everyone to eat like pigs. and the drinks come in pitchers, not a cup at a time. i imagine the kitchen is filled with vats where they cook huge amounts of the soup, the ribs, etc. anyway, the show was v. cheesy but sort of entertaining. if you like song and dance numbers, while eating mass amounts of food, then you would enjoy it. so the mc announced that there was a group from japan. i bet they were really enjoying themselves. can you imagine what they were thinking being served allll this food? and at such a cheap price? only in america.  oh, i was reading this article and it told the amount of calories in a starbucks venti vanilla latte. mind you this is not even the frappe but just the latte (espresso, milk, and vanilla flavouring). it was 870 calories! i think that included whipped cream. it made me think about that mcdonalds case where those people sued the fast food chain for making them fat. it's true that the restaurant can't be held responsible for their bad decisions but there should be some sources readily available that tell people the nutritional content of food. i had no idea a starbucks drink has that many calories... and a whopping amount of fat. i remember being interested in knowing the amount of calories in a latte (since i consume them so regularly) and could not find it anywhere on the starbucks site. and i bet everyone thinks the drinks are zero calories since it's just "coffee."
