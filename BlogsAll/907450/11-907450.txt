yipeeeeee !!!!!!! 3 day weekend. oh how i long for these times. unlike some people, looking your way nick edney ha ha, i don't have any days off except for three day weekends.    yes there are many and i mean many bad bad movies out there. (sigh) but have no fear there are great dvds out there like simpsons season 2 and pulp fiction. and of course fall tv is coming up ........ ohhh i can't wait .... gilmore girls (9/24) and will and grace (9/26) for me but bernie mac (9/18) and that 70's show (9/17) are just as good. i would say x-files of course but ...... may it R.I.P. (sniff) i miss mulder and scully :(  for now i'll just settle for american idol .... go kelly :)  good about the no baseball strike ... go dodgers .... i love popples, like pigern said i use to have a rock star one ..... and seriously jem was truly outragous  random thought of the day: this is actually more for yesterday ..... why do i bother watching the vma's, they are no where near as good as the late 80's and early 90's i.e. paula abdul, janet jackson, snoop dog and dre, old madonna, most 80's hair bands ha ha and the list goes on. the good: michael j. and his speech (that was classic), hives and vines, christina a. with new boobs and being high, jimmy fallon, guns n' roses performing  the bad: no doubt winning best pop song (that is wrong), dashboard confessional winning mtv2 award (come on people), eminem (will he PLEASE SHUT UP), the entire show ........  music to my ears: what about us - jodeci
