THANK YOU NICK EDNEY.........  YES NO ONE BLOGS ANYMORE.  if people don't start blogging soon then there will be some ass kicking going on, ha ha okay but seriously no pressure but if anyone wants out of the blog/board just let me know.   now on to vegas ..... good times had by all ...... well at least i hope. i can't speak for everyone but i had a good time. thanks to reel beat, darth bronger, nick edney, and dorkus melorkus and her two sidekicks. i'm pretty sure i was buzzing that one night but i kept telling myself i wasn't ....... i guess it really is mind over matter. ha ha. hey is it just me was it getting HOT in here "so take off all your clothes" ...... ha ha. oh and darth won big (sorry nick) so that was cool as well. side note - it was fun waiting for the the hoppers to show up (which took forever) and fill the slot machines ...... NOT !!!!!!!! i will end on this note: $1.00 jello shots anyone???????  random thoughts of the day: 1. why is everyone shocked that i drink now ..... i guess it is surprising .... eh 2. why do guys just have to slap on a polo shirt and khakis and they are ready for a club but women have to take over hour to get ready and look all nice and wear painful shoes 3. i wish i got paid more at work 4. when will good tv be back on ...... geez 5. people who live in their bubble world are scary >:oI  music to my ears: to wish impossible things - the cure
