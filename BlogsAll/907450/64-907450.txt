ok, so ive been thinking about my top ten list.  after discussing it with new wave, and after she decided that neither  beautifulgarbage  nor  rock steady  were eligible for a 2002 list, ive made some other choices.  (this is tentative and may be edited in the future)  8.  since music sucks nowadays:  my home-made best of the smiths & depeche mode cd (HAHAHA - anyway, ill be back to finish up later, when i can think of at least 3 more cds that i own and like enough to list here) 7.  paulina rubio -  border girl  (the new songs are cool, but love the new english versions of some of her best spanish stuff) 6.  mariah -  charmbracelet  (not the best mariah work, but ive been with her since "vision of love") 5.  juanes -  un día normal  (just a cool spanish album) 4.  garbage -  shut your mouth  (3cd uk singles  // features some bad-ass b-sides plus two versions of the video and an awesome cover of the stones' wild horses) 3.  shakira -  grandes éxitos  (a collection of most of her best spanish stuff, bronger, check it out) 2.  aaliyah -  i care 4 u  (although not a real best of, it includes alot of good songs and the new ones are also good) 1.  kylie minogue -  fever  (uk re-release featuring a bonus disc with remixes and unreleased tracks, note: "can't get blue monday out of my head" & "come into my world (fischerspooner mix)")
