yes darth there are a lot of cars on the road now ... what is up with that. it is taking me so much longer to get to work now, not that i'm in any rush to get there ... i'm just saying. hey darth sorry about the mix up this evening ... i'm a loser and rude hence my imood.  i didn't vote today ... so i can't say anything, i really wanted to though .. (sigh)  man hedwig sorry to hear about med. school, i always found it funny when people said oh doctors make all this money and blah blah blah ... i mean think about the amount of work that goes into being a doctor and it's not like you have all this time to spend money or even make that much ... eh go figure.   nothing much to really talk about ... you see strange movies nick and you and lisa are SERIOUSLY SICK for going to the bridal expo ... and actually having fun, what is wrong with you ... ha ha. hey dorkus please tell me all the good reel beet stories when you get a chance, i bet they are all classic .. HA HA.   this post was for sunday:  i went and saw me some saves the day  - aside from being WAY TOO OLD for these shows, std gave a good performance, i liked how they played a pixies song which none of the kids there even knew who the pixies were ... ha ha classic, seriously.  personally i don't think it was as solid as it could have been, a lot of stuff from their older albums. and what is up with chris (the lead singer) and his new look, a hanson hair cut with nerd glasses and we are not talking the typical emo kind then there was his strange dancing. the other three bands were not so great, ash was the best of the three but even they were pushing it. although they did bust out jack names the planets and kung fu from the angus soundtrack. one highlight from their show was their cover of a weezer song, pretty sweet.    music to my ears:  love will come through - travis :o)
