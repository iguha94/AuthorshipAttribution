i went and saw me some  narc:  it is a really really really good movie. should everyone see it ... NO. the movie was very dark and grim, which was fitting but most likely you will not leave with a good feeling inside. the movie makes you think and it sort of distrubs you.  random thoughts:  - i have to go to the dentist tomorrow which i am not looking forward to. see i haven't been in awhile, hence my bad breath all the time, anyway yea i'm just worried he is going to find all these things wrong with my teeth and i'm going to have to have all of them pulled out. ack. - how do they greenlight such bad movies out there. i'm mind boggled by that. i saw the preview for the movie "the core". oh my goodness that looks so bad i don't even know where to begin. i also like how i heard that the new j. lo and ben a. movie "gigla" or something was SO BAD that people walked out ... ha ha that is great. - staying on the topic of how bad some movies are let's go to how bad some music is. i like how the new music week on mtv is made up of bands like the donnas, new found glory, good charlotte and the used ... WTF. they all suck so bad oh my gosh where do i even start ... and talking about the used i like how that guy bert who is with kelly osbourne was wearing a midtown and good charlotte shirt on one ep ... man i sincerely hope he was mocking them and not admiring them but i have a bad feeling it is the second one ... BLECH.   on the beat box:  lost cause - beck
