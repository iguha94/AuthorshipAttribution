hmmmm it's been awhile since i'm been home aka the blog page .....  well to catch up on some old stuff ..... people who do "crazy" diets are still lame ... last week i had dinner with my old college roomie who is back in philly now and her boyfriend "the little red headed boy" and we (me and the little red headed boy) were discussing how every woman at our workplace talks about losing weight yet they are still fat so obvious something is not working.  dorkus melorkus - at our office we have a card (usually really corny) that is passed around for some coworker's b-day and most of the time i'm writing "happy b-day so and so. have a good one." i have no idea who these people are ?!!??? oh well. it's almost as great as those lame high school yearbook we would sign with "k.i.t" and "it was nice knowing you in chem. class" and "see you next year". ha ha cracks me up.   my highest at blowing so far is 174 or something like that. not that great ..... eh.  random thought of the day: if supposely you become cynical as time goes on .... meaning you realize a lot of the dreams and hopes you have as a young person say 21 till 30 will vanish as time progresses because reality sets in ..... what happens to those who already are way too cynical at age 21 and on .... do they become even more cynical ..... is that even possible .... i'm just wondering .......  music to my ears: homesick - vines
