waiting for something to finish dl so i guess i will blog ...  hey NKOTB rules you have not been blogging ... do you still want in the house ... if not you're out.  mac the knife and darth ... it was nice having dinner with you guys ... good conversation (wiping tears of laughter from my eyes)  bored bored bored ... not sure what to write about. one pet peeve i have this week is people who have problems in their relationship and then decide well i have my friends to turn to for comfort but it is like hello you hardly talk to us and now you expect us to care. oh and i'm really not into hanging out with couples ... i guess because i'm getting a freak image of what life is going to be like for me when all my friends start getting married. it is hard when you have friends who seem like married people and you are single to hang around that. it makes you feel left out like when all the cool couples would hang out in the far handball court at brightwood school ... ha ha only a few people will get that. yea but seriously i mean i heard when you get married that's pretty much it in the whole friend dept. thing ... in that you won't really have any unless they are other married people ... esp. if you have kids ...    on the beat box:  out of time - blur  ... THIS IS SO GOOD :)
