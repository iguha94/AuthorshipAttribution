another week .... it is almost the end of march, insane.  biggest pet peeve of the moment: when you fwd something to your friends and they have the nerve to fwd it to their friends and their stupid friends hit REPLY ALL and all my friends end up getting these fu**ing mass e-mails from people they have no idea who they are .... what the fu**. people how many times do i have to stress ... use REPLY and not REPLY ALL if you have something to say ... sorry to some people in the house who have been getting mass e-mails from people they don't know :(.  hey hedwig congrats on finally getting your car, i'm sure you have been waiting for that forever. i think you are on your way back to philly now ... man the two weeks that you were here in cali we didn't kick it once. what a bummer. well when you come back in the summer we will def. meet up okay. as for your red headed boy's mom story ... how did the lunch end up going. she sounds like she really likes you and i doubt she would bust some crazy meeting with the two of you .... but yea tell me how it went.  as for the war ... too many thoughts and emotions to write about. i guess like mac the knife i rather not comment about the issue.  man finally T.W.I.F.O.S.L.Y you are back in the mother fu**ing house. ha ha. it felt empty here without you :) yea no worries about my b-day thing which was ages ago, we'll just have to go out again some other time.   on the beat box:  was listening to the part III album from 112 ... they are so good.
