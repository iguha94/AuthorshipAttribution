hedwig... your blog made me tear.  but i don't know how much that means because i'm very emotional (just ask new wave).  just the other day i saw some protesters on fairfax and this made me tear... thinking about their passion against the war and how little it means to bush because he is going to do what he believes is in the best interest of the people.  we are powerless. anyway, i hate most (if not all) romantic comedies because they just make me feel bad.  isn't that weird?  aren't people suppose to feel happy after they see the two people finally together.  yay! happily ever after right?  but it's usually just a fairy tale and not true in this sad, depressing world.   so, i'm listening to idlewild in my car on my way to work and one of the lyrics is "can you tell me ten words that you use to describe the world to people?" and this made me think... what could be the definitive ten words?  because the world is so complex and language itself is so limited in scope and meaning.  i mean how could you describe the world with words that could encompass what people rant about on this blog?  and everything else going on... the threat of war... the failing economy... heartbreak.  hm, bit of a tangent eh? okay, last thought: so my friend and i are venting about our current annoyances, which turned out to be both regarding lame coworkers.  and it's totally trivial because it's just work, "don't let it get to you"... but it does.  and i'm so petty but i think it's unfair that i'm not getting the cubicle i wanted after i got promoted. and instead it's going to the other guy i don't like. but it's so trivial and minor.
