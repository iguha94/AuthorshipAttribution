ahhh finally done w/ all my secondary applications.  i just finished temple.  really highly doubt i'll get anything from the UC's....*shrug*  UC's suck anyway!!!!! :P  anyhoo, just wanted to drop in and say hello to everyone in the house---or shall i say NOT in the house.  I get to go home next week so that's cool...I'm hungry, I want turkey hehe.  I bought Lion King tickets for December so I'm happy about that.  It will be a good Christmas break.  I cant' wait until school is done.  I hate it.  I hate this year.  I need more structure.  I don't like research...it's interesting but I'm too lazy to be doing all that work dammit.  I'd rather see patients and take their history's...can't I get a Master's degree by doing that? hehe...master's in community service.  awesome! :D  i am neglecting my research duties...but I don't care.  don't care!!!!!  mmm oh I watched Dawson's Creek...I didn't really like the ep too much....the show is annoying, but I watch it every week...weird.  i just don't like the fact that everyone gets w/ everybody else.  I guess you need that kind of dynamic to keep the ratings up.  I guess it would get pretty boring if Joey and Dawson were together for the whole duration of the series.  Ah well, I don't like Dawson right now...I like the guy Joey has, but no doubt before the end of the series D and J will get back together....i don't think they should.  I DO however think Ross and Rachel should....don't worry they will.  hehe.  Ok enough of my sad sad sad discussion of TV characters as if they were real people.  *sigh* the life i lead...it's sad hehe.  currently listening to: THE LOUD ASS LATIN MUSIC PLAYING IN THE LOUD ASS CLUB NEXT DOOR.  they play every wed til 2am....i'm livin in the lap of luxury, complete w/ live in mice and cockroaches(well just the one cockroach that i saw and tried to kill today)...soon my room will smell like smoke if it doesn't already.....*COUGH!*....*cough*...*choke*.....*flatline*---"beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep"
