so excited. where to begin ...  NEW RADIOHEAD ALBUM DROPS JUNE 10TH IN THE US  and is titled, of all names, "hail to the thief". 14 wonderful new tracks. i can't wait even though they might not tour in the us.  also expect a new album from blur, althouth i think only ftc knows this, called "think tank" to arrive may 6 in the us. finally some good music is coming my way. i was getting so tired of my good charlotte and arvil cd. (rolling my eyes) yea the freak right.  the oscar's yesterday were alright, nothing interesting or special. it was kinda of like most of the winners were expected. i've already given my long rant about the ameoba workers so i just won't bother. does anyone here watch six feet under ... that show is really really good. not as great as x-files but i still enjoy it. and it is not as good as 24, which comes back tomorrow ... finally.  okay nick here are some cool things to check out in cancun (i know, i know ... new wave girl actually went to cancun where there is sun, how scary is that). try to catch the bull fighting show, if you are really sensitive to animals being abused you might not like it but it is worth seeing. there are bus tours you can take outside of cancun to other cities which is so worth it, just to explore and stuff. oh and go to the myan ruins site, not sure about the spelling. that is really really really worth it but it will be hot but so worth it, seriously. then there is jet skiing, scuba diving, looking at fish, hang gliding over the water, and boat trips to islands around cancun. there should be more than enough for you guys to do in 6 days. oh and don't forget the shopping, it is really good there and you can always bargin over the price, which actually ends up being pretty fun. oh and the food is really good, all you have to do is order an entree and you get unlimited drinks .... UNLIMITED ... so sweet.   on the beat box:  radiohead - a wolf at the door
