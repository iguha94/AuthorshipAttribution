hello everyone. okay hedwig, i also watched dawson last week. i don't watch it regularly... actually i hardly ever watch. i think it was the fifth episode i've ever seen but i was curious since no doubt was on. i think joey (or katie holmes) looks less cute each year. i don't know what happened to her. her coloring is off... too orange. and audrey slept with the guy jen liked! ewww... i think jen looks cuter each year.  alright, new topic. i was pretty upset yesterday at work because me and the coworker i dislike were both given tasks. and i did mine incorrectly because i was given the wrong directions. so while i was fixing my mistakes, my coworker snorts and says "you aren't done yet?" ewww... the nerve! so i lost my temper and replied, "you don't have to be so haughty." but i thought about it more and i suspect that arrogant attitude stems from the fact that he is older (about 30) and born in china. in that culture the man is dominant and therefore more domineering. i don't want to think we can't get along with those from other cultures but i think it can be more difficult. when i was at ucla, i met a great girl from hong kong. she was super nice but i could never really talk to her because communication was difficult. she didn't get my sense of humor and i had to explain more in depth what i said to her. so naturally our friendship fell apart pretty easily. anyway, perhaps if i take into consideration these factors of culture and communication, i'd get along with my coworker more. i hope. i think it'll be hard though. (and by the way, he really did snort. gross.)
