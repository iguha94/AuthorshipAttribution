that justin song...hmm i only heard it once...sounded kinda redundant.  anyway interesting thing about that song.  the girl who sings(not the one on the video b/c i don't think that's her)...well the red head went to h.s. w/ her and supposedly was supposed to go to prom w/ her hehe.   her name is vanessa marquez...random trivia for you.  not really feelin the song tho.  sorry to hear about your job woes...there's a lot of things wrong w/ america right now hehe.  healthcare, econ...oh yeah and that war that no one is backing us on.  *shrug*  i was a john mayer consumer whore today hehe.  i bought his album(which i already had burned), and his live CD.  But let me tell you the geeky, retarded, bio major reason why i bought his CD hehe.  the sole purpose for me buying the "no room for squares" album was because he had a periodic table on the CD AND the squares on the CD cover and back actually made up the periodic table w/o the elements..just the squares and the colors.  isn't that cool?! haha.  He must have been a science geek to do that.  plus on one of his live songs that i heard my cousin play the other day...he was talking about taking out the cereal part of count chocolate cereal so that the girl would have more marshmallows...then he said, "I would increase your marshmallow:cereal ratio for you." haha...it's good to know there are dorks like me out there. :)  hope everyone is having an ok week.  listening to: john mayer--uh one of his live songs that i haven't heard and can't recognize...too...lazy...to walk over...and look at the title. hehe
