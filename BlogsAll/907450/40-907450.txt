ok, must blog after the interesting show last nite.  of course, shirley and the boys kicked major ass, shirley is soooo cool (and no, i do not sound like a girl).  the distillers were cool also, but brody looks like a major druggie and i feared she would fall over and die.  and then there was no doubt...  the set was alright, or it could have been alright.  they are a good band with good songs, but the audience TOTALLY KILLED IT.  i mean, they killed my "concert buzzed" that garbage had created.  once they came out, the audience went crazy, and not in a good way.  too much shoving for the first couple songs, with people trying to get to the front, only to just stand there like bitches, totally no respect for anyone.  it was all them, i-know-two-songs-and-own-the-latest-album-so-im-a-fan peeps.  not that i was so into the set, and im sure people wanted me to get out of there, but i had my garbage shirt on and there were no ambiguities as to why i was there.  anyway, i knew i had withstood the insanity for some reason, because after the "encore", which, yeah, i think is silly.  gwen brought out garbage & the distillers and the girls sang blondie's call me, while the boys played, totally awesome.  of course, all the kiis-fm/no doubters hadnt a clue what they were singing, but i totally enjoyed it.  i was, however upset with myself that i had not saved a couple pics on my camera to take of the girls singing.  oh well, lesson learned.  so, yeah, garbage needs to tour alone from now on. oh, and FTC, the blur song, is, um different, yet good, cos its blur, haha. alright, peace out.
