i went and saw me some  old school:  and man was it funny. ha ha i mean it is not great but pretty funny. i really liked vince v. 's character. will f. was just as good though. yea you guys should all go see it .... earmuffs :)  as for the whole coldplay thing ... don't even get me started. when they first came on the scene with parachutes i thought eh okay. that song yellow was killed by the radio but their other songs like shiver and spies were actually really good. then they came out with a rush of blood to the head and everyone loved them even more. i actually thought that album was weaker. personally i think coldplay is more of a media darling because chris martin is way easier to talk to then strange and weird lazy eye thom yorke. but seriously RAIDOHEAD is brilliant. if you have ever seen the live you would know what i was talking about. so so so great. as for comparing them to U2 that is crazy talk, not even in the same league and i don't even like U2. ha ha.  as for good music mac the knife ... honestly there really isn't anything good. if anything i say pick another genre of music like jazz, hip hop, r and b or electronica beacuse at least you will have another sound to listen to.  working is really wearing me out. with my cowoker gone and the new chick doing only half the work i am so feeling it. oh well .... got to keep doing it ... i hope i get a raise though. that would be great.   on the beat box:  massive attack - special cases
