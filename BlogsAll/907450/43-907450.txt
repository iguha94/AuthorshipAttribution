good to see some people are in the house :o) ......nick why would you divorce or split from the person who you knew you would be good together with, i mean he is not the supposed ONE but if you knew he was good enough to be together with then isn't he was worth the fight of working things out with. and i don't think it would be the end of all relationships for you, just with that one person who is the supposed ONE.   in reality (at least my warped one), there is no ONE person out there, actually my random thought was more on why people use the term "knew/know" was all because i don't think anything in life is for sure. i think people would like to think the person they are with will be the ONE but maybe others don't. and yea maybe people want to settle but see they don't think it is settling, they think it is their true love and that they "knew" this was the person, i just don't like people using that stupid phrase. and mac i agree with you shockingly enough, i mean if there is that special someone then why do people spend so much time looking, don't you think that ONE person will just come when it is time ...... obviously they don't so we as people settle for whatever we have around us and sometimes, key word i used here is sometimes please note that everyone ... i did not say always, end up in unhappy marriages just because society deems it so. ha ha man people are fucked ......   music to my ears:  nothing really ....
