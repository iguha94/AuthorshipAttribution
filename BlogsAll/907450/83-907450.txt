ha ha pigern mocking me about my x-files geekness ... well ... you are correct (pushing my glasses up) i was excited ... after all i get to talk about the x-files :)  the ep you saw hedwig was all souls (ep. 5x17), which is in the same season as christmas carol (ep. 5x05) and emily (ep. 5x07). please note the eps were not run in order because david d. was filming "playing god" at the time. christmas carol (ep. 5x05) has scully visiting her family, which is now just bill (her brother) and his wife and her mother for the holidays. she receives a strange phone call during dinner, which sounds a lot like melissa (her dead sister) to go to a house and investigate a murder. she end up getting mixed up in the case involving a family and their little adopted girl name emily. when emily is given to child services, scully tries but unsucessfully fails at adopting her. at the end of ep she learns after some DNA testing that the girl is her daughter. in emily (ep. 05x07), scully is trying to deal with the fact that she is the mother at the same time helping emily with her disease .... not to give too much away the little girl dies and scully has to try to understand why for a moment she was given the chance to have a little girl of her own only to have it taken it away, which leads to all souls where i personally think scully comes to term with her lost.  okay that was pretty x-files nerdy of me but can i say that ep brings tears to my eyes (sigh). i mean that one is so touching and gillian anderson gives a great performance. another great ep is closure (ep. 7x11) about mulder and his coming to terms with his sister samantha ... man that one made me tear up so bad ... (sniff)
