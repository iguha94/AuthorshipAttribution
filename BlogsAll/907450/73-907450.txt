eh about the whole french people thing ... who cares ... ha ha  i went and saw me some  the life of david gale: not a bad movie but not the best. it was pretty good though, i can't really complain considering i paid nothing for it. kevin spacey was great in the movie but isn't he always. kate winslet was good as well but kinda of forgettable, i think just her character was. i think it is one of the better movie out there for people to go see compared to other crap like daredevil.  yea dorkus sarah supposely gave joe stupid a bj ... nice huh. ha ha. the best of the worst from AI was one giant clip show. it was okay, i didn't watch all of it. seriously what happened to eden's crush ... oh i know i think their label dropped them and all those girls had such huge egos they killed each other. ha ha great if that were true.  anyone going to coachella this year. i wasn't going to but i think i am now because blur is playing ... man they are so great ... but who knows.  random thought: so basically we have nothing to really look forward to as we get older expect getting married and having a family. we can get those master degrees and advance in our jobs/careers but that's pretty much it huh. hmmm i miss being a kid so much, so very very much :*   on the beat box:  grinding halt - the cure (old cure)
