exactly...the year has definitely flown by.  Listening to all these radio call-ins this morning was hard.  A lady from New York talked about how, like any other work day, she was supposed to get off the subway near the north tower at the time one of the planes hit.  but  of all days, on 9/11, she didn't.  i only caught the end of her story so i don't exactly know what caused her to miss it.  but she was definitely blessed.  and it was hard to listen to her say she felt guilty for being one of the fortunate ones... anyway, i remember it just like most of you guys...getting woken up by my mom, telling me to turn on the tv.  when i first saw it, i thought, oh, a fire or something.  but when i found out what had really happened, i was so taken back.  i could not believe that people in this world could actually be this coldhearted and evil.  i listened on the radio the whole way to work not even thinking that the office would be closed for the day.  so i sat in the office for a couple hours with people who had come into work as well.  When i heard that downtown LA was under heightened alert, i kept calling my mom (who works there) to leave and go home, but her office wasn't closing down for the day.  i can't tell you how nervous i was for her.  and  i can't even imagine what it could have possibly been like to be a new yorker that day....
