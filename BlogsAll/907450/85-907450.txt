so i'm bloggin b/c i need to ramble to someone..and this is a lot better than me emailing the red head....must...be...strong!  just missing him that's all...and also trying to decide if i want him in my life or not....like if he came back and was finally "ready"...would i/should i take him back?  i kno u guys don't really kno me or my situation but just wanted to put that out there.  if trust is breeched...even if it was like over a year ago and i'm still having issues with it....is there no hope for the relationship?  anyway that's what my mind's been wrestling for the past week or so.  still no answer.  *shrug*  but on to more important things hehe.  for you ladies....altho, new wave i know you wouldn't have this problem, but maybe some of you might? or even guys i'd appreciate the opinion/advice.  i bought this shirt...clubbing shirt..and the whole back is shear....so i guess it's like borderline backless.....should i wear a bra or no bra?  i mean i would be ok w/ not wearing a bra, but well....u kno, if it's cold, i don't really want EVERybody to know.  the bra i have looks ok w/ it...but is that tacky?...wearing a bra w/ something that i guess is meant to be "backless"?    so those are my two rants...hope everyone is having a good friday....i'm not a very good catholic....all i ate was meat today..i was a christian today :P
