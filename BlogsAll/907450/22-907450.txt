so i was talking to new wave about the state of music.  i think that's what most of our conversations revolve around, but it's cool.  anyways getting back to my point, the state of music pretty much sucks ass.  i really can't think of an influential band since 1995.  i would say that Pearl Jam has pretty much influenced, in a bad way, the likes of Creed and other bands that sound like Eddie Vedder, but they are old.  then there's that whole rap/rock crap that's out there but they all sound different right?  yeaaaaaah.....  whatever happened to the good old bands that actually had talent, and not some gimmick?  even good ol rap music sucks now, everyone ranting and raving about their bling bling, ho's, cars and what not.  all the beats are taken from old songs and remixed, no one is original anymore, Ja Rule, Mystikal, P-Diddy can all take a backseat to Sir Mix A Lot, Paperboy, Vanilla Ice....errr maybe not them, but seriously EPMD, A Tribe Called Quest, Public Enemy, etc.... put them to shame.  but alas i find hope in band of the yester-years of my life, for example Milli Vanilli, now there's a band that was influential.  they influenced all the new "pop" stars out there.  who else could lip sync better than Rob and Fad?  you may say oh well there's Britney Spears, but come on now, she was obviously influenced by Milli Vanilli.  haha okay i'm really lame and i know it, but regardless the state of music sucks, whatever your genre.  any comments?
