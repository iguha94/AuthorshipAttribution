yeah when new wave starts flashing back we are all in trouble, its best to stay clear.....did motown philly make you want to find 3 friends and wear matching sport coats and jeans with hats on and dance around? I know it always does for me. Yes pigern job searches are depressing, hence they are a search, the best idea is to first apply where you'd really like to work, then where you wouldn't mind working, followed by anywhere that is hiring......sorry you spent yesterday watching that show you could have turned it off if you had wanted to......yes new wave there are no good bands of recent times, many groups are good like the ones you mentioned but the problem is that they are inspirational not influencial......like others may here them and appreciate the music but it does not impact the music of today, its in its own category.....sigur ros is a good band, and i'm sure they are appreciated, but you don't find a lot of people who say that they were totally influenced by them.....With commercial appeal being one of the leading factors to what many consider to be "influencial" there doesn't seem to be an abundance of good artist to come out in recent times. If you look back to the 50-80s you can see defining musical styles of the time, mainly because of the social atmosphere of the time, if you look at what many of the bands today are singing about is it really worthy of being influencial on another person? Which goes back to my song meaning vs. song sound rant, which i will go on another time........thanks and goodnight
