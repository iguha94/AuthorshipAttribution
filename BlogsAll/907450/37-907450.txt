u go new wave chick!  yeah i feel the same way u do, but more about like garbage fans.  i dont care if other people like garbage.  i dont care if they havent liked them since the beginning, because it wasnt their fault they didnt know about them.  but then, there are the evil people who think they like garbage because they like "special" or some other song they heard on the radio, or because they bought one album, and then go to the concert and take up seats, while true garbage fans, who know the lyrics and enjoy every single song (not just the singles or the ones from the radio) have to sit in the back and put up with a room full of posers!  FTC! u feel me on that one?!?!  i dont particularly like the angels, i dont like baseball, too boring, so i cant judge whether or not theyre a good team, but yeah, all them wannabe-fans, that will forget about them next year if they dont do well, should get over it and get a life, find something u REALLY care about to cheer for. anyway, pigern, thanks for the welcome!  and the name is from none other than garbage's song "confidence"      "ur confident, so confident, ur full of it, ur full of sh*t.      but you see...       the world is full of girls like you, the world is full of sluts like you,      so u see...       we'll believe it, when we see it." ok well, thats about it. hey, ftc: have u gotten the "april tenth" song?????  its soooooooooo good!
