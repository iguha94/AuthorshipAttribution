hi everyone! omigosh, it's been so long since i last blogged! well, i have been trying to compile a list for best records of 2002... i wanted to put r.e.m.'s reveal until i realized it was 2001. darn! here are some in no particular order... ben kweller: sha sha (dorkus, i'm sure you agree?) white stripes: red blood cells (no, new wave, it's not just because of the whole 'garage rock' thing) bjork: family tree and/or greatest hits (you can't go wrong with bjork!) strokes: is this it -- hee hee, no i'm just kidding. it's good but not the "best" coldplay: a rush of blood to the head (seriously, better than parachutes. it's amazing. and i'm not a big fan but they won me over with this one) idlewild: american english (they just get better and better! i'm counting this one even though it hasn't been released in the states yet) haven: between the senses (produced by johnny marr... come on, anything related to the smiths can't go wrong right? hee hee.) lorien: under the waves (not sure if released here yet but absolutely brilliant. just when you think the last track was amazing, the next one blows you away) badly drawn boy: about a boy soundtrack (surprisingly, it outshines his full length album 'have you fed the fish?') death cab for cutie: you can play these songs with chords (b-sides the make you think, "these didn't make the album?") hm, stuck on the last one... i'll reluctantly end with nirvana: best of collection. (reluctant only because the collection feels like the first 15 minutes of a really good film. it leaves out much of their brilliance found in the rest of their albums. 'you know you're right' is enough reason for the album to make the list though. that single is tops!)
