actually dorkus melorkus it has been about 2 weeks since you lasted blogged so not too bad ...  as for gifts this year i did alright. i got more simpsons stuff than i thought i would but i'm a bit bummed i didn't get as many dvds as i hoped for but hey what are you going to do about it right.   i went and saw me some  antwone fisher  and  real women have curves : AF - was great. i HIGHLY recommend this movie to everyone. it is a good story and the acting is wonderful. RWHC - was good as well but i felt a bit too short. they could have developed some characters more, it almost seemed as though they ran out of money for the movie so they just ended it, eh who knows.  i still want to see gangs of new york, max, adaptation, about schmidt and of course lord of the rings: the two towers again .... hee hee that would no. 3 for me. i kinda of want to see the hours, standing in the shadows of motown and chicago. if there are any takers for these movies just give a me a ring. :)  random thoughts: it is going to be 2003 soon. oh my goodness. what have a done this year .... nothing much i guess, i just can't believe another year has gone by, sometimes i miss school ... well at the very least the 2pm naps and all the tv i use to watch. man i'm getting older and not wiser ... ha ha. okay so i offer this for you people who might actually read or post in the house ...  WHAT ARE YOUR NEW YEAR'S RESOULTIONS  ... i know this is dumb because no one really keeps them but for me it would be to translate the hobbit into latin and like everyone hit the gym more ... ha ha okay that was from snl. not sure what mine really are ... i'll post them next time :P   music to my ears:  warsaw - joy divison
