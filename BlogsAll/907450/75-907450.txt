I am seriously traumatized and damaged for life because of one silly mistake I made while in Vegas. I thought it would be funny to vistit the Celine Dion store while at Caesar's Palace. Boy was I wrong! I will never regret anything in life as much as I regret this:  Imagine walking into a store full of Celine Dion (CD) freaks. "My Heart Will Go On" is blasted on the speakers, so you immediately cover your ears upon entering through the doorway. You don't care if you are offending the CD freaks. They are freaks so it doesn't matter. They are probably just as crazy as Celine Dion herself. You realize you've made a mistake by going into the store, but you can't get out because there is a CD freak to your left, and to your right, and in front of you, and they are holding the latest and greatest CD merchandise in their grubby paws, like CD jewelry, clothes, baby bibs, spoons, mugs, lighters, tampons (kidding i hope). You dart out of their way, but you can't make it out the door - your ears are starting to bleed, you eyes are starting to tear. You can't see so you try to feel your way out, with the hopes of possibly knocking over some CD merchandise. After what feels like an eternity, you make your way out and realize you will never be the same again. A part of you is lost and gone forever. You are no longer naive and innocent. You have seen the horrors of the world. You are ready for anything.
