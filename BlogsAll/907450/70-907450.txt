hello all. it's been awhile since i've last blogged. i've actually started another blog page for a book club i formed with some friends. it's pretty deck (hipster version of "cool"). :o) it will be like i'm in school again... having my discussions in english class. seriously though, just cause i was an english major, people usually want me to proof their stuff. kind of weird since my classes weren't about grammar or anything. anyway, looking back, i wish i did more fun things while i was in school. took more chances and studied less. i guess at the time you think grades are super important (and they do matter) but then once you graduate, you kind of regret what you didn't do. or at least i kind of do... there are all these great events at ucla coming up. one, mcsweeneys v. they might be giants - a type of music v. written word thing. two, david sedaris. and three, the annual l.a. times book fair. i wish i went last year. i lived right in the neighborhood! so i wouldn't have to pay for parking like i will now. ((sigh)) but i hate how filthy the campus gets. thousands of people on campus makes for a big mess. okay, i have a query: if you recommend someone for a position and the company decides to hire her but she backs out kind of last minute and decides she doesn't want the position, does it make you look bad? like, the company will think, why did she recommend this girl when she doesn't want to even work here? just a little concern of mine at the moment.
