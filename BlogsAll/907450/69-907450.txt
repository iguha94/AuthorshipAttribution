man i've so been MIA, sheesh .......  just to let some of you know the blogger page isn't always the best. i know some of you have tried to post before and then checked and nothing happened. well the site sucks sometimes but can you really get mad considering this service is free. one way to make sure you post is to hit the post & publish button at the right top corner.   nothing much to talk about ... i'm back to full weeks of work which scares me. i don't have a day off for at least 95 whole work days. i try not to think about it or i will kill myself.   i hung out with jane and dorkus melorkus this past friday. it was good see jane since i haven't seen her in seriously like AGES. ha ha. it was funny going back to the inland empire aka the ie. i saw bakers and all the white trash people i could handle ... it was great (okay not really) ha ha.   what is with this whack weather people. first it is hotter than ever then it rains and then it is cloudy then super windy, sheesh will they just make up their mind.  did anyone see joe millionarie on FOX. man that guy is dumb and i mean DUMB. he is a perfect example of why people should go and get an education and he's not even good looking. blech ... i like how he is milking this for all it is worth. i guess everyone wants their 15 mins.    on the beat box:  retro - new order ... okay this isn't a song but actually the new order box set that came out this past tuesday.
