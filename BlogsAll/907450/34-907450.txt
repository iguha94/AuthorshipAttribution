  I LOVE THE CURE FOREVER    i seriously LOVE the cure a lot ........ they are so very very great. moving on i saw spirited away this weekend and pigern and i enjoyed it. the animation was amazing and some of the characters were really cute  ..... too bad darth fell asleep towards the end, what a moron. ha ha. in addition, i watched brown sugar this past weekend, i enjoyed myself but i mean it was not great or anything, after all it was a romantic comedy. i also watched dorkus melorkus's almost famous dvd. that was a good good movie, although i was not a fan of penny lane (kate hudson) but loved miller (william fugit).   yes the angels are kicking ass. so juwanna man are you peeing in your pant with happiness as you should be, who would have though they would make it to the world series ......... dang. one complaint though is the amount of poser angel fans, i mean i'm glad people are supporting them but it is getting a bit ridiculous. there are so many people at my work place who went to the game this past weekend but they NEVER mentioned being an angel fan before, i think it kinda of sucks. oh well though.  man hedwig it will be cool to hang out with you and FTC, unless FTC fakes on us AGAIN. ha ha.      music to my ears:  all-nighter - elastica (man i listened to this cd today over 3 times ....... hee hee)
