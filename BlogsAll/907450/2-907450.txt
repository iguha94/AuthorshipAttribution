hello everyone. the cure show last night was definitely one of the highlights of my trip. it was amazing. the weather at hyde park was picture perfect -- sunny but not too hot. all of the opening acts were good but the cure was top form. when they came out, the crowd went mad. i wanted to take pics but felt like a dork. but once the cure walked on stage, cameras were going off everywhere. it was like paparazzi. i think i got some really good shots myself. robert walked slowly from one end of the stage to the other taking the crowd in. and then they started their set, which included many older songs. they even played three imaginary boys, with robert describing it as the song that came out when they were just starting (i think he said as a three piece). robert was wearing a black button down and jeans... actually i think they were all wearing black shirts. except for simon who was wearing a black vest. they did an hour and a half set and then came back to sing two encores. it was hilarious because after the first encore, everyone became even more insistent they come back onstage. the cure ended their second encore with just like heaven, inbetween days, and boys don't cry. all three sent the crowd into a frenzy, jumping fit. fireworks went off in the end and robert said "it's been a great 25 years. see you again in the next 25." even after the show was clearly over, the crowd continued to cheer and no one would move in the hopes they would come back... even after the stage lights were turned off and the equipment was being moved off stage. sigh. good time.
