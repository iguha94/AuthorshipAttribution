coachella coachella .... alright time for my review: i'll make this short since i'm sure not everyone cares about this. it was not a big hassle like i feared it would be .... which is good. first band to watch was south but i must admit i was pretty unimpressed so i just sat that performance out. second was idlewild ... i've seen them before so it was nothing new. third was N.E.R.D. which i have to say was a pretty weak performance. fourth was the hives ... dang where do i even start ... i'm not a huge fan of their music but dang can they rock. they are so full of it and just so cocky ... it was great. fifth band to see was blur ... now this was the group i really paid to see at coachella and i have to say ... it was the damon a. show. i mean he was really working it ... i didn't feel like it was blur ... oh well. yea and damon was really trying to push the new album think tank .... (sigh) oh well. sixth in line was the beastie boys and all i have to say is i have complete newly found respect for them as artist. they are very very good live and i really enjoyed their set. that pretty much concludes my review of coachella. my only real regret was not watching queen of the stone ages ... eh.  i'll write more later.  sleep ............
