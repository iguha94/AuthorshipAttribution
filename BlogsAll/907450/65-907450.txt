i haven't blogged in awhile ...  funny story about the bathroom mac ..... (LOSER) ha ha   hey pigern the reason why people at your workplace don't like books and cds is because YOU WORK IN L.A. where the people are shallow and love material goods, afterall it improves their self worth.  sorry hedwig no idea where you can get cheap disneyland tickets at :(  so yesterday i went with the "i love lucy" crew to medieval times and good fun was had by all. it was actually pretty entertaining considering how expensive it was ... not sure if i would ever go again. the highlight of the night was when this moron picture girl spilled pepsi on me and jason (the b-day boy) ... yea we both LOVED that but our fair bar wench was quite kind about the whole thing and gave us extra desserts.  okay so december will soon come to a rapid end and then 2003 will be upon us ... so i just thought ... to get some  people talking in the house ... you guys would want to do a top 10 for 2002 (PLEASE 2002 ONLY) - you can choose either best/worst albums or best/worst movies .... if you do all four then you are hardcore and have a lot of free time.  i haven't done mine yet but i will be posting it up shortly.    music to my ears:  miss you - aaliyah (go buy the i care 4 you cd with unreleased tracks and bonus dvd people !!!)
