first off i would like to welcome hedwig potter to the house, so happy you have joined us ........ how did that article on prempro study go. ha ha. don't worry hedwig nobody really blogs here all the time, i have to get on their backs about it. they all suck donkey balls, ha ha.   my american idol wrap up - i'm really glad kelly c. won. i have no idea why but i actually want to hear her song on the radio, i usually hate this stuff but honestly this girl has talent and deserves to be shown off. i mean look at all the no talent out there that gets the same attention ..... as for justin i think he was a good sport about the whole thing and he WILL STILL do well ....... and yes the british guy (the pop idol who won over there, not simon who i really like) was terrible, how did he win over there, go figure ..... why did they drag the last ep out for two hours, i guess they were milking it for all it was worth ....... i hate the two host, they are terrible, i'm just waiting to see ryan starr become a porn star ha ha .......  well now that american idol is over there really is nothing to watch on tv. oh well i'll just wait for the season to start, there are some good shows darth but yea you are right ........ most of them will get cancelled right away but i mean there is a new season of 24 - this is for hedwig, keifter sutherland comes back for another 24 hours and they don't bring back his wife cause she died in the last one so he gets a new love interest but the daughter is still in it ....... and john doe looks pretty good as well.  amelie is a great movie. i just like the way the movie was done ...... visually stunning you know ........  random thought of the day: i can't believe it has been one year since sept. 11 ....... it makes you think of all the things that have changed and some the things that haven't ........ (exit the house sadly)  music to my ears: dressing up - the cure
