i miss 5 cent slot machines ..... (sigh) oh well. actually what i really miss is the bonus rounds on those slot machines. ha ha i don't even care about winning. reel beet  let's go back to vegas yea so i can "pretend" to be buzzed. hee hee.   another week has gone by ..... ack ... man life is depressing when all you do is work but at the same time life is even more depressing when you don't have a job. sheeh august is just flying by. then it will be fall and then winter then spring again. okay okay enough reflecting on time. i'm going to start feeling old soon.  random thought of the week: i went to a wedding this past weekend and decided marriages are nice when they are under the eyes of GOD. i just believe marriages are more likely to last than marriages of people who don't marry under the eyes of GOD ... not that i'm saying the people who do not marry under the eyes of GOD won't have a good marriage ..... far from that. it could go either way honestly but i would like to think the ones under the eyes of GOD last longer ..... okay now i'm seriously rambling but you get my point ...... i hope. and yes i agree with pigern that weddings are so final and heavy. i mean that's it people ..... you are closing yet another chapter in the book that is called your life. so i guess the real question is ...... who out of the people you know will be the first to get hitched. i have some ideas but honestly you never really know.  music to my ears: another breakfast with you - ladytron
