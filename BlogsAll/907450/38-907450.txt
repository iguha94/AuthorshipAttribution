so let me get this straight ......... we should never root for a team unless we have been a true fan from the start. what if people are only rooting for the Angels because it is a so. california team (like me) or because they like the color red or whatever crazy reason people root for stuff. bandwagoners have been around for ages ....... nothing new there. i can see how you are annoyed mac the knife because that was how i felt about the Lakers (blech) but i think more people are rooting or cheering for the Angels because it has been A LONG TIME since they made the playoffs so if anything it is an accomplishment for them not like the crappy ass Lakers who buy their wins ....... boooooooooo to them .......... just my two cents .... and personally i think a majority of people know the Angels won't win the entire series so why not root for them now (sorry juwanna but you have to be realistic about this. the Angels have a good chance but not a great chance. i mean i don't like the Lakers but i know they are the best team in the NBA so go figure)  hey dorkus can i just beat you up just because ....... i mean there is no reason for it but just because i feel like it. ha ha ........    music to my ears:  doves - pounding (so excited about tuesday show ..... YAY!!!!!!)
