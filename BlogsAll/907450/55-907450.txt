Hey everyone! just want to say Happy New Years to everyone.....and don't forget don't spike the punch cause it will make you punchy!  Anyway my new year's resolutions are:  1. try to do more outside stuff: i.e. golfing, camping etc 2. read more books that I have been saving up 3. keep my room clean for more than 3 days 4. stop buying stupid crap and save more money 5. stop making stupid lists  and here now are my top lists of the year  Top Movies 1. Star Wars Episode 2 ----Only cause i'm a really big nerd can't believe I have to wait another 2.5 years for the next one 2. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers -- great story and effects, the finale is only 1 year away!! 3. Antwone Fischer -- Denzel directing debut shows his great ability to be a story teller and a character at the same time 4. Red Dragon -- Way better than Hannibal plus it had Ed Norton, he's cool!! 5. Far from Heaven -- This movie leaves you feeling depressed, but it has amazing acting performances by moore, quiad, haysbert hon. mentions: undercover brother(most underatted comedy) jackass (it gave what it promised) panic room(not a great film but jodie foster was cool) punch drunk love (disturbingly cute)  Worst Films 1. Sweet Fricking Home Alabama ---Sweet merciful crap how did this get made? 2. Van Wilder -- I can't believe I paid for this tripe 3. Spirited Away -- Animated Films should not be over 2hours long movies that are bad even though i never saw them: Scooby-Doo, maid in manhattan, crossroads, how does this crap get maid?  i'll have more best of's in a bit.
