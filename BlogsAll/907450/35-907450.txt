why am i the only person f*cking blogging ......... ha ha :oP  so darth tells me some story from another person's blog page about how they went to a chinese cafe and saw some ugly roach there and how gross and nasty it was and then darth added ha ha to chinese cafe ...... look people every resturant is dirty some how some way. if you are telling yourself this is not true then you are in serious denial. i'm sure we would all like to pretend that the place we are eating at the cleanest in the world but truth but told ....... no. anyone who has worked in a restuarnt can tell you it is not the cleanest, i never have but some coworkers of mine did and they told if there are not roachs then there are mice so take your pick. ha ha. as for chinese places, honestly i know they are dirty and i think if you are stupid enough to go there expecting a clean environment then you deserve to be stupid and if they were really as dirty as people think they are then the health dept would have shut them down ......... just my thought. in addition, it hasn't stopped me from eating at sam woo on garvey and I KNOW FOR A FACT that place is really not clean but it is really yummy ........ ha ha so bite me .  i could have sworn i did a rant about this before .......... hmmm i wonder when (shurg) oh well.
