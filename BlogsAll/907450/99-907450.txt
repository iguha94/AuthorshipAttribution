darth and new wave drinks and dinner was good times.  the lesbian reference aboout the "golden #%$^@*" was the best.  i'm still cracking up.    so my weekend is almost over, now i have the wonderful opportunity to drive back down to san diego and work for another week.  man....  sorry if it seems like i hate work, i really don't.  just i like it better up here in la, because of the hollywood scene.  yeah right..  so this weekend i viewed "better luck tomorrow" and "anger management"  both were decent picks as it turns out.  i guess i'll write more about it tomorrow when i'm at work.  as for new wave's comment on the handball court thing, i have a few more memories to add.  sorry if you can't relate to this portion of it.  the far handball courts comment, i think i get it, but i believe i went to a different school (GO MARGUERITA whatever we were).  and no no, you got it wrong, the far handball courts were where the cool people did fake drugs, i dunno if you knew about that, but ya they did fake drugs there.  and isn't that one container next to the bungalow classes where chia pet broke chan-man's heart?  ya i think it was.  haha.  or what about when "someone" couldn't go to disneyland.  hahahaha.  man i don't miss elementary school at all.
