hello again. class is finally over. i just took my final and it was pretty easy. now i have two free days in london, highlighted of course by the cure show in hyde park. dorkus melorkus, i'll try to see if there are any other copies of bk's phone home. there are so many cds i want to buy here but my luggage is already filled to capacity. the bk show sounded pretty good although i dislike chain reaction. i think the floor should be sloped so everyone can see better. i went to a small club called borderline last night and it was really hidden. you know like how in swingers they say the cool clubs are those without the signs? well you had to walk off the main road to another side street and then the club is on another street off that side street. supposedly really famous bands have played there under pseudonyms, like r.e.m., blur, etc. the band that played last night was mediocre though. i think i have to go to a show tonight by myself because everyone else in the group is pretty intent on going clubbing, which i really dislike. has anyone heard of the rapture? sound like early cure and have been given frequent coverage by NME recently. darth, as much as i would like to see dc here, i can't because i will be back home by then. how sad huh? btw, small wonder was such a bad show, it was good. and out of this world is classic. classic i tell you. also, i went to this photography bookstore yesterday and the owner asked me where i was from. when i said l.a. he said, "oh all that smog and those earthquakes!" i thought that was funny because the air in london is pretty bad itself. i think l.a. smog is even better than the exhaust filled, grey air of london. and earthquakes aren't that frequent in california. oh well. i just smiled politely. he was an old man, i couldn't argue.
