yes life does have meaning once you give it one, however do i even know what that meaning is yet ........ i am still trying to figure out what i want to be when i grow up and what i want to accomplish. i'm still confused as to who i will become that it is hard to decide what my life is going to be like. in addition, what might bring us meaning at one point in our lives does not mean it will bring us that same meaning a day later, a week later or even a year later. people drift in and out of our lives everyday, people get sick, people lose their jobs, people lose their security, and etc. yes the life/the meaning of it is not handed to us on a silver patter and yes we must try to search it out, that is i suppose the purpose of living, at least a part of it.  yes i know i complain a lot. people view me as someone who blows things out of proportion, a drama queen if you would like to call it. i'm sure i'm blowing this whole "meaning of life" thing out of proportion and if i am then so be it. however who doesn't whine and bitch about stuff. you think everyone flows through life completely content and the minute anyone says something negative or that comes off as a downer, notice how people are so quick to shoot them down, to agrue with them that every point they make is WRONG, INCORRECT, ERRONEOUS, WICKED, SINFUL, AND THE LIST GOES ON. well i'm tired of it. so here are my negative thoughts and you can think they are wrong as long as you like.
