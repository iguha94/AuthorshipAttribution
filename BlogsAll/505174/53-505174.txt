           Interesting stuff...    Earlier this morning I found that   Glenn  had added in comments to his site...and I rejoiced! But now I see it was just for   one post . Too bad, I think he's one person that  should  have comments, since a million people go to his site daily; I'd love to see their instant reactions to what he posts up there [since most people usually share their more in-depth answers to what he posts on their blogs].   Someone from IRC   posted this link  at noon and made a comment along the lines of: " Total Recall here we come!" I read it over, laughed and shrugged it off. After all, I missed the link in the post that led to the actual article. Then I went to   Drudge  and and apparently, what the kid posted was true...There was the link in bold font, underneath a large picture of Mars:   Ice reservoirs have been found on Mars !!! Damn. This is insane. Well, now I'm gonna have to rent Total Recall and see what's in store for us...       ;)               UPDATE [1:25 PM]:   LOL!  I started this post at around 1, but with all my checking [and re-checking] of links [to make sure they were the right ones] I just missed posting about the Mars ice before   Glenn . Damn my slowness! LOL, oh well. And apparently he has the abillity to pick and choose which of his posts get comments...Too bad. This might be good in the long run [since the smaller articles won't need commenting] but maybe he'll mis-judge which articles people want to comment on...*shrug* Well it's his blog.
