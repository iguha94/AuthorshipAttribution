         Horrible day turned out OK; news at 11.  Heh!  So I hopped on the train to begin my commute to school and not two stops into the commute there was an announcement over the speakers: "There has been a fatality in Mineola so this train is going to be delayed in Farmingdale for an unknown amount of time."  Lovely. I slept through it all and woke up in Penn Station; the last time the train passed by a station where "a fatality" occurred, you could still see the blood and pieces of once-human on the tracks and that was  not  an experience I wanted to relive. When I finally arrived at school, I immediately took my E-Comm test; I feel pretty good about it even though I know that I made two stupid mistakes on it. Ah well, after that train ride, I'm glad I was able to even get through the test. I even managed to stay awake during my Systems Analysis (trust me, that is  quite  an accomplishment) and I even had fun during my C++ tutoring session...So my day was looking up.  I get home, eat salad, go over my day, talk to some friends on irc and check my email when I suddenly realize that the screen name of an old friend of mine from BU was online...So of course I immediately shut down my emailer and IM him...and we talked for a good long while on both IM and the phone!  It was insanely awesome; I  can't even begin to describe  how awesome this was for me...   :D  So all in all, a shitty day turned out to be awesome.  Excellent.  More tomorrow; right now my bed is calling me...
