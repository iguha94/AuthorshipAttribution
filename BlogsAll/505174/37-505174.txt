           So, anyone else having problems with Blogger...?    I keep friggin posting and updating but to no avail; this is getting mighty fucking annoying. GRRRRR!   Well anyway, I read   this article  [via   Sasha , but by email]. I honestly am at a loss for words on this one:    UNIS Director Kenneth Wrye defended the school's no-flag policy. "We're not an American school. We are a United Nations school. It's that simple," Wrye said.     You know what though, Mr Wrye? When your school's  student body , [you know, the one that is made up of the  international students  that you are so vainly trying to "protect" from the world] recognizes the disrespect being shown and understands the issue better than you know [or give them credit for], it's time to bite the bullet and do what's right. Fly the flag.  Dumbass.               Changing lanes here,  I completely forgot that this weekend was   I-CON ; damn, I missed meeting   Voltaire   yet  again  !!!!! ARRGH!  Oh well...next year, hopefully. *keeps fingers crossed* He's one of my favorite musicians; right up there with   Trent ,   Maynard , and a few others...*sigh* Oh well.   ...Not like I was gonna miss the BlogParty...HEH!   There's always next year, Voltaire...   Anyway, enough frustration for one night [bastard Blogger!! You killed my nice long posts! GRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrr......] -- It's time for sleep. I honestly have no desire to try to face another day of school  without  sleep...Nitey nite!
