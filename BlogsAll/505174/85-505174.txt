           Coffee house blues.    A new coffee house just opened up in my town this past week; nice little place, damn good coffee, excellent sandwiches but their prices are a little too steep for the area. Uh, hello? We're not    The Hamptons , nor are we    The City , so if you lower your prices a bit, all will be well. I'm not saying slash everything in half, I'm just saying take a buck/buck-fifty off of each thing on the menu and all will be well. Unfortunately the owners are really nice people so if I wanted to say that, I'd have to find a nicer way of doing so. Doubly unfortunate: I love this place and its sandwiches and am now addicted. Bad Ravenwolf Bad! No Ivory Mocha for you! *whine, whine* Just yesterday I bought lunch there and walked away $16 and change lighter. I got: a large Ivory Mocha, 2 black forest ham sandwiches [one to go that I ate today for lunch! MMMMmmmm!] and the cookie specials, which were apparently raised from 3/$1 to 3/$1.50 [but they were homemade on premises and damn good...*sigh*]. $16!!! Ah well, I guess it's to be expected, being that it's a  coffeehouse , but like I said, we're  not  The Hamptons  nor  are we The City.   Bitch, bitch, moan, whine, complain.   Please excuse me while I go drown my sorrows in an Ivory Mocha. [Damn them for being so addictive...]    :/
