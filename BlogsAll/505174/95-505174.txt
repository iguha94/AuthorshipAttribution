           Frustration/Exuberance    Ok. Quick post:    My dog is still alive and kickin....She's doing well. :D   I'm alive and exhausted but I'm happy because my damn blog FINALLY looks the way I want it to.   Blogger still likes to throw posts into oblivion (this is my 5th attempt at posting, hence why  this  post is straight to the point)   Sorry to those who were nice enough to update their links to include my "new/old" link...I think I'm gonna stick to blogspot because it makes my life easier.   YAY! I finished Nick's template (and am really proud of it) so go check it out right now!   Ramblings of a Blue-Collar Slob    Whee!   Lane says my blog is : "Brilliantly but obsessively focused on whatever interests her at the moment."     Bigwig thinks  my blog smells like talcum powder, baby oil and sweat....   I can't stand by and let Mike Whybark look more fabulous than me   in a real Paul Frankenstein shirt ...   I know I'm late on this, but...Dammit...Dan, those   puppies  are cuuuute!   Again, really late on this (but better late than never, ya know?)...  He who  thinks  he's Randomness  got engaged! CONGRATS!   Also...CONGRATULATIONS to   Steve Gigl !! HE'S MARRIED!!!! Yay!   Old but awesome: Jim finds a site   that has funny smily-faces  for those of us who don't like your run-of-the-mill everyday smilies....   Google! DayPop! This is my  blogchalk : English, United States, New York, Long Island, Ravenwolf, Female, 21-25!    I think that's it for now. I'm loggin off.
