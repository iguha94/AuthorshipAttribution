           Grrr.    So I wrote this nice post inspired by my joy at dancing to Santana's "Black Magic Woman" but when I clicked "Post & Publish" ...my wonderful post was lost to digital oblivion.  Grr!  I   hate it   when that happens! Oh well, not really much I can do about it. Blaargh.    :(    I heard the resounding collective sigh of relief emitted from all around the blogosphere and that's how I knew that   Asparagirl  has returned to blogging. Welcome back Asp!   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~     ~~~ ~~~ ~~~     Annessa ! Sorry it took so long, but I just wanted to say thanks for permalinking me!  I also want to say thanks to   Kyle Still  for adding me to  his  permalink section and also say hello and thanks to    Alan Daniels  for the same thing. While I've been reading Kyle for some time now, I'm not exactly sure who Alan is [sorry Alan!] but I like his site anyway so go check him out.  Hello to   Sashinka  [hella cool name!] and thank you very much for your nice words of praise! Heya   Jessica ! You've got the backing of a lot of the cooler, heavy-hitting bloggers out there so you're definately off to a good start! Don't worry, if you do make it to the party, just listen for the loudmouth attached to the short female. That'd be me...    ; )    Bonjour Emmanuelle! I have to agree with you, the poll did go on   a little too long ; either way it was fun!  Sorry to dissapoint you Rabbit, but I guess you're right; I happen to  love  my   multiple exclamation points , and I guess others do too...   HI RYAN ! [Say hi to your friend Raj too...]  :)   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~     ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   Joy! I had one hell of a workout today at the gym doing something called "pyramiding". What it boils down to is a strength/endurance test to make sure the muscles you're exercising are where they are supposed to be. Sometimes you surprise yourself and realize that the weight you can bear is more than what you were previously excercising with; this is good and the proper adjustments can be made to the workouts. You don't  think  you're doing that much but afterwards, you do feel a little achy being the fact that you just finished testing out your musculature.  Now, while I normally   despise   country music, a country singer has endeared himself to me: Toby Keith. I heard about him during my workout [they have the TV on for the people on the bikes and the treadmills] -- He was scheduled to sing at some big event [only heard parts of it] but at the last minute they canned him because of "controversial lyrics" contained in his new single "The Angry American". They posted the lyrics on the screen and it was just damn good patriotic stuff [in MY eyes at least].  IF I can find the song and/or the lyrics I'll post them up here. Screw the event planners. It was good stuff.  As for other Blogstuff?   Mike 's on a posting roll and [YAY!] his link is working again!  Found   this amusement  via   The Society  [and later found   another link to it  by the VodkaPundit].    Lane explains  the differences between Madonna and Kelly Osbourne [I really can't stand that pink-haired little...]. Yeah. Read it.   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   Last thing:    To   my Nick , the   Evilnet Crew , my fellow Blogger friends, all my other friends from school and life and all the other random people who voted for me in the   Sexiest Blogger Poll ...You guys fuckin  RULE !!! HELL YEAH!!!  It's all good. MMMM HMMMM!!  I won! I still can't believe it...It's cool. *nodnod*      :D    However, I just have to say that the fact that some people took it so seriously is still hella amusing to me. Ahh, these silly people who tried to turn it into some sort of controversy with their childish attempts at insults, inane accusations and finger-pointing, and other such infantile behaviors in the comments sections of multiple blogs...I guess they just can't handle a little bit of fun. Well, at least it was wickedly amusing to read! Thanks! You made me laugh my ass off.     >:)
