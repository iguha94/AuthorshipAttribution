         I rememeber seeing this awesome site of a company that was working on VTOLs for actual use. They were pretty nifty looking and I wanted one...but I couldn't, for the life of me, remember the addy for the site. Then it occurred to me that a friend of mine showed me the site and so I asked him if he had it handy. Voila!   VTOLs  that look pretty damn cool...and they're calling them "SkyCars".  I just keep remembering that commercial that was aired around the beginning of 2000...I  think  it was for a random phone company, but all I remember was some guy raving about when he was young they said that in the year 2000 there would be flying cars. And he kept repeating, "Where are the flying cars?! I WAS PROMISED FLYING CARS!!!"  Heh. Maybe if you remember it you'll laugh along with me.   So I went to the store and saw two of my friends that I haven't seen in a  loooooooooooong  time...Jon and Jenna. That was pretty cool; we played catch-up-with-each-other's-lives. LOL!  At least it wasn't as bad as when I ran into James Goroleski at Borders...now  that  was...Strange, interesting and weird all at the same time. Last time I saw him was in 1998 so...the catch-up game we played that day was pretty intense to say the least.   Never a dull moment :)  See? Not all the things I post are stark-raving-pissed-off rants!  ;)
