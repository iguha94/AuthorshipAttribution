           Another day, another Bomb Scare...    Yeap, you read that right. Let me tell you, that was odd as hell; heading to Penn Station on the E, the train I was on was stopped at 50th Street [2 stops away from 34th/Penn] while the conductor and the station announcer conferred as to whether the train was going to be allowed to stop at 34th. After about 10 minutes, the train continued on and we were allowed to get of at 34th; it was weird. The first thing I noticed was the yellow caution tape blocking all the turnstiles -- we had to walk through the service gate single file. Once I arrived to the usual entrance, it was cordoned off and guarded by police officers who explained that Penn Station was closed and nothing was running due to a serious police investigation. Luckily we arrived at the tailend of the operation; after about 7 minutes of waiting around, they got the ok to let us all in at 2:18PM. I walked into Penn Station and the first thing that hit me was the emptiness and the quietness. All the shops were closed and gated, and there wasn't a soul in sight besides my fellow commuters behind me. Except, of course, for the myriad of police officers and their bomb dogs. I have to say those dogs are beautiful and [obviously] well trained; the first two that I saw were German Shepherds; but not of your usual coloration. One, a large male, was solid black with amber eyes and his smaller female companion was the same except for white markings on her paws [that made her look like she was wearing socks] and white on the very end of her tail. The others that I saw were normal German Shepherds -- still nice-looking dogs, but just not as impressive as the first two that I saw. All I have to say is, these guys have their shit together. Penn Station returned to its normal busy self by 2:30PM.   Weirdness. Like I overheard a fellow commuter say to his friend, "Just another day in NY."  Never a dull moment.  Heh.
