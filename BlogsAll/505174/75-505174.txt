            Names...    David Tepper of Wake Me Up On Judgement Day    found this   website  that supposedly gives you your personality by "analyzing" your name. HE wasn't impressed at all; I just find it humerous! Here's my results...No, it's not my real name, but most of the answers overlap:   Raven :      You make impersonal decisions quickly, but not so with personal concerns.     You like to think things over carefully, but tend to be indecisive.     You have much enthusiasm with a driving attitude toward achievement in life.     You can easily detach from people and situations.     You enjoy unconventional friends.     You can be quite inventive and quite curious.     You can handle details well.     You have a methodical mind.    Wolf :     Take advantage of all opportunities.    You must develop your creativity and talents.    You are determined to prove yourself to others.    You have a great deal of loyalty to those you love.    You have much inner strength.    You have a diplomatic flair to your nature.    Equality and fairness are important to you.    You are naturally friendly.    You can be the life of the party.   Heh. Like I said, some of the answers overlap; a few of them I even like! One answer that I got for my real name was this:  "You enjoy being stroked verbally and physically."  LOL! I love that...  ...And, no, I'm not going to tell you if that's true or not.     >:)
