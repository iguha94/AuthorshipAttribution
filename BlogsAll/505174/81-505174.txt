           Friday excellence...    Yesterday was a beautiful day, I'm sure...The sun was streaming in my windows and all was well, considering that my cable modem decided to go on strike at around 2:30 pm and refused to work for a long time. Enough for me to call up the company and ask if there was a problem in the service area; nope, no widespread problems, just me. Heh! They said they'd send someone over in the morning to take a look at it so I busied myself with laundry, cleaning and straightening up in preparation for some stranger just walking into my house. Joy.  So it wasn't exactly the most incredible of days; it got to the point where I started even cleaning out my harddrive. Paul called me up at around 10 to see if I wanted to hang out and being that I haven't seen him in a long ass time I said, "Sure!"   It's all about Beef Bishop Way.   >:)    All in all it was a good day.   Now I'm late on most of this stuff, but who cares? It's fun: ~~ For my friends who play BattleTech -- Watch out! Now there really is a   ForestryMech ...HAH! ~~   Nick Denton  found a cool link to an article that goes superbly in depth about this whole "blogging phenomenon" by   Rick Bruner .  ~~ Eric Raymond of   Armed and Dangerous  decides to provide an objective male view on   porn ...[forgot how I found that link, I apologize] ~~ And I happen to like this blog now:   Not the Droids You're Looking For ...Somehow, I got a referral from them and I have no idea how that was possible because I sure as hell can't find where they linked me. Ah well, random referrals aren't uncommon for me and I'm just happy that I found this person's blog.   :D   ~~ Is it just me or do the   people at NPR  have something stuck up their asses? ~~ And   some things are better left unquestioned . Come on now, who really cares what's in there that makes you feel good? Just enjoy yourself and don't question it. ~~   New money ? Good stuff! Just don't make it pink or anything... ~~   Another one bites the dust . ~~   EPA says toxic sludge is good for fish  -- That just says it all, don'tcha think?  ~~ I heard   about this  as it was being discussed on   The Buzz ...   Like I said, all in all it was a good day. Let's see what later today brings...
