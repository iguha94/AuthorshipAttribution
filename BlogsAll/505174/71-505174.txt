           Now comes the weeks-long beautiful music of her tortured screams....    Heh. So I'm bored, annoyed at the fact that I wasn't able to buy tickets for Spiderman and I want to get out of this damn house. I'm to the point that I'm debating going to the theater anyway and watching any old stupid movie since the ones I wanted to see aren't cooperating...  The last showing of Ice Age was 4:45 PM.  Damn, and I wanted to laugh... Deuces Wild, a movie about a 1950s-era street gang [damn cool in  my  opinion] looks good, but I'm wary of those 4 1/2 stars when everyone else is saying it was horrendous... Spiderman. It's 9:12 PM by my clock; it's sold out by now. Life...OR Something Like It -- the only redeeming value that this sappy ass looking movie has is that Angelina Jolie stars in it. [She's my favorite actress...]  Whatever. Blaargh. Screw this. I'm probably just going to wind up in front of this damn computer...like always...listening to music [Photek: Modus Operandi's playing right now] and surfing the net. My life is boring even me...  I'll scream later. For now, I'll just revel in my insanity.  Oh, here' s something I found in my travels...Sorry; I'm usually better than this, but I forgot where I found this: my stomach is bothering me right now so I'm not feeling up to par. Anyway, enjoy.
