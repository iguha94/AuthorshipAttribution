         One of these days I swear I'm going to die laughing.   I mean this in a literal sense; I have a  touch  of asthma that really isn't  too  troublesome to merit me carrying around my inhaler  at all times ...It's brought on by excruciating excercise [e.g.,  if I tried to run  full speed  for a mile, I'd just collapse] and severe laughing fits. Yes, you read right,   severe laughing fits  . Anyway, I was in IRC [talking to pretty much whomever will listen to me] and something funny came up...Well...There's no real way to describe this, you'll just have to read it for yourself...   Just keep in mind that:  1.) I'm  demongirl   and 2.) This would  never happen  [LOL]: ________________________________________________________________________________   [14:05] * Gunslinger shamelessly plugs his website http://arrogantrants.blogspot.com/ [14:06]   no work [14:06]   There better not be a NickCam.

Funny, funny stuff...Except for the panicky minute where I couldn't for the life of me remember where the hell I left my inhaler last...  I think I my abs just got a tremendous workout from that.   Thanks guys!  :D  Heh :)  So now that I'm recovered, I'm going to  actually  get something to eat  this time .
