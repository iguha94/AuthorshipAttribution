         Yeah...So I just got back from my workout at the gym. I feel...pretty damn good, considering my small fit of depression yesterday. I can still jog my 1/4 mile with no problem; my weights have increased and I feel like I accomplished something today. I found a couple of good blog sites earlier this morning when my insomnia acted up...I'm not sure if I want to add them to my rather large collection of links yet though. I'll see how I like them over the course of the week and if I'm still happy with them, I'll post them. It's not like I  know  these people, so they can run my gauntlet before I start "endorsing" them.   Heh. >;)  As if I was so damn important that my support would merit lots of people flocking to their sites to see what I like.  LOL!  Ah well, I can dream can't I? Yeah, I can, it's what dreamers do best and I know that I'm nothing but a Piscean Dreamer. Talking about dreaming, I found an interesting book while at Borders yesterday; it's called  The Dreaming Universe:  A Mind Expanding Journey into the Realm Where Psyche and Physics Meet  by Fred Alan Wolf, Ph.D.  Pretty damn good so far; Wolf takes great pains to explain himself and I like his no-nonsense style of writing. As for my previously mentioned books, I finished  L.I.E.  by David Hollander   in record time...after all it was a pretty slim book and the way he writes; well, I just couldn't put the damn thing down. It was interesting, amusing and slightly disturbing...although there were times where I just had to laugh out loud. Really interesitng book. I'm still re-reading   Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time:  The Updated and Expanded 10th Anniversary Edition   -- This one's taking me a bit longer since some of the concepts aren't fresh in my mind anymore and I actually want to take my time while reading so I can fully understand what Hawking is saying.  So that's what's new in my life right now...Pretty interesting huh?   :D
