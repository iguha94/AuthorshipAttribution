         Tomorrow is the blogbash; 25 people are supposed to show up. I'm somewhat worried since a few of the people whose blogs I'm addicted to will be there and I'm not sure how to approach them. This small voice in the back of my head is whispering in one long repeating run-on sentence: "Don't bother going since you'll only make a fool out of yourself, they are all more intelligent than you, you'll never be able to hold your own with all these people, they discuss meaningful things that you will never understand, they don't care about you or your little piece of digitalia, you are insignificant and they know that you're alive, you don't matter in their worlds, they are so far above you that you can't stand on the same level as them, why are you going to even attempt to try, you will fail..."  Heh. Damn that little voice; damn my childhood fear and shyness that likes to pop up at the most unconvenient times to aggravate me. I'm hoping to purge myself of that damn voice at the gym through exhaustion. Honestly, I don't think it will be a problem but we shall see. If it proves to be correct...Well...At least I would have met the minds behind the pixellated thoughts that I read on a daily basis.   Hmmm.... Is there anyway I could plug this party any more?        Nope, not at all.  >:)   If you will be attending the party and are curious as to who I am... I'll be the chick who is with the   guy  in the  black army hat .
