           Grrrr...    So I leave my computer for five friggin minutes and  somehow , in that timespan, I lost my friggin post. How the hell this happened, I have no clue... Grr.  Anyway...  Everyone has their weird searches and I've had a ton of my own...the current ones are as follows:  "sleepy fishnets individual" -- Apparently I rank #7 on Yahoo! Search for this. "Rachel Klein naked" --   Scarily  , I rank #2 for this on Google and I have no idea why, since as you can plainly see, I have nothing... "blogapalooza, Galt" -- I'm both #1 and #2, however this blog is #2...Although I have to say I'm glad I checked this since I came across a new [to me, at least] blog called   Capital Influx ...which decided to   post my blogparty sticker up  on its site!  Imagine my surprise seeing my little creation on a stranger's site! I hope to meet her at the party...  ...and, of course, the obligatory "Asparagirl photo" search, where I somehow come in at #8. Heh.   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   Awww!  Pej is cute as a   resident of South Park .... And  he called me  charming !!! AWWW!!!    ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   It seems like everyone who took the test is very similar to me...  Dev from   Society for the Preservation of Clue  is 74% similar to me and we're 76 % complementary Herebtyger [Ummm, Sorry, but I'm not gonna post your email and I don't know where you're from!] is 77% similar to me and we're 74% complementary Pej from   Pejman Pundit  [but you should have know that already!] is 60% similar to me and we're 88% complementary Paul from   It's a bright June afternoon it never gets dark  is 77% similar to me and we're 78% complementary S. G. from   Fixing What's Been Broken  is 76% similar to me and we're 77% complementary Craig Henry [Sorry, again, I don't know where you're from !] is 77% similar to me and we're 74% complementary  ...And of course you already know my results to Lane.   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   Something hella funny from   Glenn : the   SIRC Guide to Flirting     Clearly, it makes sense to exercise a degree of caution with people who are married or attached. Most people in long-term relationships can cope with a bit of admiration, and may even benefit from knowing that others find them or their partners attractive, but couples differ in their tolerance of flirtatious behaviour, and it is important to be alert to signs of discomfort or distress.    So, if I say to you, "BACK THE FUCK OFF!" -- Trust me, you should.  It is a sign of  your forthcoming discomfort  in which I will rip your fucking head off, introduce my steel-toed boots to your ribcage, wreak havoc on your knees with my baseball bat and run your body over with my car for good measure if you don't step down and look elsewhere.  Capiche?  Good.   I'm glad we understand each other.   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   And I think that does it for now...I need to go check to see if a book I've been waiting for has been delivered to Borders...See you later!
