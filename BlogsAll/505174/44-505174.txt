         Bleh. Well Blogger decided to send my nice long post into digital oblivion. That rots; please bear with me.  Ever run into someone completely unexpected? This happened to me today; I was in Borders talking to some friends of mine and drinking my chai when I turned around and found myself face to face with my old "first-year" English professor from my second college. While this might not  sound  like much, it was to me; he is one of the few professors whom I respect and admire. Plus, he's the one who has encouraged me to continue to follow my dreams, do what I love and be true to myself  other people be DAMNED . It was nice talking to him again and getting caught up with everything that's been happening in his life.  I've recently rediscovered the power of spoken word; since I never find the time to write things down I've been walking around with a mini-tape recorder to tape some of my random thoughts. So far it's come in handy many times, not just for my thoughts but also for class; I've found that my Systems Analysis professor makes  sense  once I listen to his lecture over again. [His heavy Russian accent, thick lisp and vocal monotone makes his lectures difficult to sit through and understand.]   On a completely different note, there's a blogparty being planned and yeap, I'm going to this one, drinking my damn Guinness and hopefully meeting some of the people whose blogs I read. On a side note, "The Musical Box" [the place where the party is happening] is apparently home to some  really hot chicks  [...and with that said, I am  already  deafened by the noise that the stampede which the feet of many males will create...heh!]
