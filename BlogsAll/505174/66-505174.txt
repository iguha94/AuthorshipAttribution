           "By and large, there's nothing like being Right."    I agree with this statement if you read it and take it at face value. Why  else  would we bother to argue with people if not to prove ourselves and our point of views "right" [or, if you prefer,  correct ]? But that is not what the quote means; it's from a WaPo article that discusses the political view called  the Right     that is dominating the airwaves on AM radio stations . Or so they say. I happen to find this fascinating.  See, politics mildly scares me; there are so many different views and groups I easily get lost when they get discussed. So when people start criticizing these things about the Right, the Left, the Conservatives, the Liberals, the Independents and all these other neat little labels, I get slightly put off [since to me, those words have no political meaning]. But I'm willing to learn. The article in itself is especially interesting to me since my broken car radio is forcing me to sit up and take notice of AM Talk Radio; I can see how it is addicting, since I tend to find myself screaming back at the radio when they say something that I consider stupid. So I'm muddling through all these political groups and learning as I go and I have to say...it's fun!  Anyway, I think I should go to sleep now...  Enjoy the article.
