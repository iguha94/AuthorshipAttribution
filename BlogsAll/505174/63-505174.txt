           File under: STUPIDITY.    Not ten minutes ago, I was watching the Fox News Channel and they were talking to one of their reporters overseas and discussing the fate of the 13 terrorists and the 26 stupid motherfuckers who decided to join and commiserate with the terrorists in the Church of the Nativity -- From what was decided, the 26 would be sent back to the West Bank and  jailed  while the 13 would be sent to Cypress and held until they firgured out where they were going to send them.  Sounds reasonable, right? Being the fact that the 26 "protestors" did  more damage  to the Church than the  terrorists themselves  did...but that's a different story. Anyway, the reporter gave an update as to the status of these people. Check it out:       The 26 dumbasses [the ones who were supposed to be  jailed ] are now lounging about in a  beachfront hotel  where they are being treated as/being called  free men  and have been  resupplied with fresh guns .        Cyprus has  also  deigned to put up their charges, these  13 terrorists  in a  beachfront hotel  -- however there was no mention of it these 13 are being treated as or called free men.   All I have to say is.... WHAT ... THE ...  FUCK  ?!  Maybe it's just me, but these people are INSANE!! They shouldn't be treated like tourists or royalty --- they should be treated like the trash they are!! Beachfront hotels, my ass!   If this was  my decision  I'd find a nice  medieval castle  and throw them ALL in one of those  dungeons . Either that or separate them and throw them all into  solitary confinement chamber WITH sensory deprivation . And yes, I'd do the same thing to the 26 -- if they are stupid enough to throw their lot in with  terrorists  they should suffer the same fate  if not worse .
