         So  happy St. Patrick's day  all you happy people out there in that wide digital landscape! Yeah, go have a pint o' Guinness on me!  [Or Killian's....or that Magner's Hard Cider stuff that I keep hearing the commercials for...]  HEH!  Looks like a  lot  of  other people  subscribe to WSJ's "Best of the Web".....my favorite article about the   new military uniform  keeps popping up everywhere, no matter where I look!  :D  On a different topic...ever get so happy that you cry? Happened to me yesterday; felt like everything hit at once and then this just overwhelming joy hit...Yeah. I don't know how to explain it...you just get it or you don't.  It's that joy of...you're  alive , you've got your arms around me, you're not going to disappear, and even though I'm all messed up, weird, crazy and neurotic, you just ovelook that and actually care about me.   Yeah.  It's the little things, it really is.   Something else was brought up, but I'm still pondering that. I thought about it yesterday and it made sense...I could go into it, but I'm sure that if I started talking about it, I'd wind up writing some sort of thesis on why this is and how the events of my life has given this particular psychological problem shape and form.  And then I wonder if I missed my calling...Then again, there are  way too many  psychiatrists and psychologists out there now anyway.
