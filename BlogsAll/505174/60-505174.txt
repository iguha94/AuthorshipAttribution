           Recuperation? Somewhat. Now back to the daily grind...    Yeah, I haven't been getting much sleep this whole past week, and while two nights of it were worth it [he knows why], the others...well...just  weren't , to put it plainly. However a few good things did happen. Some I won't talk about here, but others I will...Such as    Fleet Week!  . Whee! My good friend is coming home for a little bit; while a   good many ships  are attending, to me,   his is the most impressive . That is just the coolest thing happening right now.   :)    Also, about three semesters ago, my friend discovered   Inklink!  [a game of pictionary] via one of his friends, while I discovered   DFILM  [a place where you can make your own little Flash movie] through my friend Jack. We swapped amusing links; I made three movies, he made two and we teamed up to annoy the hell out of the other players in Inklink!. I used to have the links to my old movies, but they have since been lost within digitial oblivion...and then I lost the link to DFILM since it was in my favorites folder at school. Heh. I finally found it again and...joy!  Yesterday, for some reason, something inside of me said, "Violin. Music. Play.  Now ." After a looooooong time away, I picked up my violin, tuned it to my piano, and started to play; I was astounded at how much I remembered. I guess some things you really  don't forget . But damn, some of those passages were hard...Oh well. Just have to work on it. I've decided to never allow myself to let that go for such a long time ever again. The music is in my soul, and my soul is the music.   :D              And of course, what would a post to my blog be like without something stupid to laugh over and make fun of? Yeah yeah, I know, not much. Heh. So a bunch of Latino critics [with a whole lot of time on their hands and a penchant for seeing problems where there are none] have decided to   attack and criticize   Star Wars: Attack of the Clones  for "racial sterotyping"  against the Latino community. Here are a few excerpts of the stupidity:  1.)  Latino critics in particular charge his latest Star Wars epic, Episode II: Attack of the Clones, toys with American paranoia about Mexican immigration with its cloned army of swarthy lookalikes who march in lockstep by the tens of thousands, and ultimately end up serving as Darth Vader's white-suited warriors.    2.)  "He looked totally Latino," says Martina Guzman, a Detroiter who's managing a State House election campaign.     "And his kid," says Wayne State history professor Jose Cuello, referring to the young Boba Fett, "looked even more Latino."     It reminds Cuello a little bit of "those Reagan ads in the 1980 campaign, that suggested if Nicaragua went communist, you'd have wild-eyed Mexicans with guns running across the California border."       Like, are you  serious ?! He, like,  totally  looked Latino? Whoa! And his, like, kid too? That's like, totally wrong!    All I have to say is...  WHAT?!   God DAMN you people have a whole lot of time on your hands!!! I mean, give me a fucking break. Being that I, myself, come from a South American country and share that Spanish background with these people,  I can look at them and say [without any regret], "You people are fucking NUTS!!!"  ...And if you  dare  to lump me in with "the Latino category", I'll break your knees [and your arms, and puncture your lungs, and sever your head from your body] because even  with  my Paraguayan heritage, you couldn't  pay me enough  to allow myself to be shuffled in with  that  crowd. I absolutely  hate  that Lah-TINE-ah accent that all the females of the group seem to carry...EWWWwwww...But I digress, and that's a rant in and of itself...  So there's some quality stupidity that we all can bond over in making fun of. Heh.            Now for some fun stuff: here's something that...well...I can't tell if it's wrong or not, but damn, it's hilarious!!!   Bush has a PET NICKNAME For Vladimir Putin ...I'm just...in awe. This is just too damn funny!   :D    And lastly, two things before I go [I'm going to be late for class...*sigh*]:  Bored of your normal health routine? Try the   Punk Rock Aerobics ...Only in Boston would this happen...Heh!   And keep an eye out for a new TV show...But that's not what's funny...the    original post and comments that follow   are what make it hilarious!  Okokok, I'm going now. Heh. See you all later.
