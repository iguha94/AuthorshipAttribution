           Humor and Fear...    For all my fellow coffee addicts:   Be amused .   :)    I'm not sure whether Richard Ankrom is brilliant or insane; those highway signs are pretty high and there are a damn lot of cars that pass underneath them going 65-70 mph, but he climbed up and   added his art to an existing highway sign . I have to laugh at the highway transit officials who didn't notice this change until someone in the local papers said something about it. Heh. Well, at least it's functional.             All I have to say is,   FEAR  .   Eight humans are getting implanted with ID chips :    The chip will be put in Isaacson's upper back, effectively invisible unless a hand-held scanner is waved over it. The scanner uses a radio frequency to energize the dormant chip, which then transmits a signal containing an identification number. Information about Isaacson is cross-referenced under that number in a central computer registry.   Wonderful. As the article says, this chip is being marketed to " to families of Alzheimer's patients--one of the fastest growing groups in American society--as well as others who have complicated medical histories "...But how long before the government decides that  everyone  needs this implant? This ties in with the   national ID card  that some people have been pushing for; now, here's my question. Don't we already have these? They're called  Driver's Licenses . Almost everyone has one and if you for some reason don't drive, you   can still get an ID card that looks like a driver's license  from your local DMV [of course that link works for NYers]. IF we have those two ID cards, why do we need a national one?
