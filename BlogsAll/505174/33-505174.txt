           Hrrrrrrm....  Friday Five ?    Well, this sounded interesting so I thought I'd join in.   1. What are your hobbies?  Oh boy...waaaaay too many to list here; top favorites include: photography, poetry, dancing, observing people, talking to strangers, RPGs, CAV and now, starting to get into BattleTech [whenever my friends have time to play!!!],  writing down thoughts, bitching/moaning/whining [sorry The Paul!!  >:) ], reading, listening to music, playing my violin and piano...   2. Do you collect anything? If so, what?  Silver jewelry, perferably rings and necklaces. Gargoyles, dragons, wolves, ravens, dolphins, sharks, hawks, jaguars of all kinds; i.e. figurines, statues, pictures, jewelry, whatever. Candles; scented ones, colorful ones, handmade ones...Stones from the beach that I like and feel the need to take home with me. Anything of a Celtic or Native American origin. Books on psychology, metaphysical studies, occult, esoterics, mysticism, spirituality and the afterlife.    3. Is there a hobby you're interested in, but just don't have the time/money to do?  I am currently involved in photography, but unfortunately I miss my time in a professional darkroom...  :(   4. Have you ever turned a hobby into a moneymaking opportunity?  Well, yes and no. Yes because at one time I was hired to play my violin at weddings and other such events. I'm currently hoping to [in the near future] turn my photography and computer obsession into a money-making opportunity. We'll see how that goes...   5. Besides web-related stuff (burbs, rings, etc.), what clubs do you belong to?   Well, I'm semi-involved with the Rotary Club -- that's pretty much the more well-known of the clubs I belong to. I'm also a member of the International Center of Photography, the vice president of my school's Gaming Club, a part of the school's online newspaper and that's pretty much it....  So there's my take on "the Friday Five"....
