         Yesterday was interesting...Nick and I drove around the island trying to find this damn book but every place we went to was either closed or didn't have it in stock. I guess that's what we get for trying to locate things on a Sunday...Heh! Anyway, as we were driving around from one store to another, we watched this white Nissan Maxima drive like a lunatic down Rte. 25: weaving in and out of lanes, dodging cars and trucks to beat them to the stoplight, ignoring the red light and coasting through it a minute before it turned green, things of that nature. It got to the point where there was a clear road in front of a random sedan in the right lane and a red truck in the left. This guy rode the sedan's bumper, squeezed past the red truck, sped up for about 2 minutes before throwing his car into the dedicated middle left-turn lane where he paused for all of 15 seconds and then decided to try his luck cutting off oncoming traffic to get to where he needed to go...  The man pulled into the  Starbucks   parking lot.  I laughed so hard I almost caused an accident. How  sad  is that!? You would think that if someone is driving  that insanely  they would have somewhere  important  to be...You know, the hospital...their burning house...but   STARBUCKS  ?!  I guess the lure of the Frappuccino was just too hard to bear. Heh.   Other than that, it was a pretty good day overall, considering that I got my allergy injections [OWWWW! Painful, but I rather  like  breathing!]. I talked to Sasha earlier and had a nice conversation...  :D    But, tomorrow is class and I need a good night's sleep; rest assured though, I'll probably update sometime during C++....   >;)
