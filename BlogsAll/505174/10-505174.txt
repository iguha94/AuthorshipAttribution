         ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!!!!!!!!  I brought my car in for her inspection on Monday. No big deal. They couldn't pass her because there was some sort of problem with the axles. They said, "We'll order the parts; they should be in by Thursday. Give us a call at 9:30 AM Thursday and we'll tell you what time to bring in the car to replace the parts."  Ok fine. Again, no big deal. I called today at 9:30 AM on the dot; they tell me,  "Oh, only one part came in and the others are on backorder. Sorry. We'll give you a call a little later to tell you what's going on."  Lovely. I go outside to check the date on my inspection sticker. 2/13/2002. Wonderful.   So now I'm screwed.   I told my story to some people over IRC. One tells me that I should always go about two weeks before the sticker's up. Normally I do this anyway...Just this time it came up as a surprise. Go figure, I brought my car in   to the same shop three weeks ago   because of a problem with my alternator.   NONE   of them noticed that the sticker was about to be up soon...  *sigh* Never a dull moment. Oh well. I think I'm just gonna eat some lunch and then start on some of the errands I have to run...  ...I'll just have to be supercareful.  Bleh. This ROTS.
