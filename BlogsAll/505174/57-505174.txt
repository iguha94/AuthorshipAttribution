           Another day, yet another bomb scare...    This time at my school. Imagine my happiness; suddenly half of the school is mysteriously "off-limits" and the place is crawling with cops. The dogs weren't called in so I guess it wasn't that serious, but still...It was scary. Apparently a "questionable package" was left on the second floor of my school; I'm assuming they decided to play it safe, since the school was in session and it is also literally within walking distance to the Queensboro bridge. Wonderful. So there was my heart attack for the day. Heh.  And, my exhaustion finally caught up to me...I normally sleep on the train coming home, but usually I wake up around Deer Park. On bad days, I wake up as they're announcing, "Ronkonkoma, last stop...Last stop on this train is Ronkonkoma!" Today however, I must have been dead asleep. And apparently my joke that I'm easily overlooked has proven itself to be true; no one noticed that I was sleeping on the train. Today I woke up at Deer Park...but as the train was heading  back  to the city!  Wonderful. Imagine my joy.   So I had to get off at Wyandanch and wait for a half hour for the next train; the conductor was in shock that he overlooked me. Heh. Whatever. Fuck you too. Heh.   I'm tired. I think I'm just gonna go to bed and save myself the trouble...Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day. After all, it's   FLEET WEEK!!!!!   Whee!!!!    Yeah.
