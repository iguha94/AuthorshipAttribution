         Tonight I feel like I'm detached from myself and the rest of the world.  Things make sense, but they don't -- the duality of life is hitting me hard today for some reason. I'm antsy; I need to get the hell out for a while and think.  I want to learn things, know things, study things that might seem out of character for me; I just want to  know , to use my intelligence, be an  informed  person. I find myself addicted to the History Channel, listening to 880 and 1010WINS, reading books that I used to read when I was younger [and ridiculed for being "nerd"] and yeah, I still read my Wall Street Journal [don't like it? screw you]. But I still feel like I'm missing the picture. I read the neat-o political crtique bloggers and find myself thinking, "Damn, I wish I understood what is going on in the political world so that I could argue these points right along with you and provide my own point-of-view." I watch others argue their points on IRC and idly wish I could join in. I'm sure that if I set my mind to it, I could figure out what's going on in the confusing and convoluted world of politics. I think this is going to be my next long-term project; teaching myself politics.  It's just that...I know that I'm a dreamer and that my creative mind doesn't like to be focused on such seemingly tedious topics for too long. That and the threat of the information overload that will come with wandering into the political arena freaks me out. I get  frazzled  just thinking about it...Yet, I still want to learn.  But I digress.  Tonight I feel like I'm detatched from myself and the rest of the world...and I'm not sure if I like this feeling. I think I'm going to attempt to find solace in a cup of coffee now...
