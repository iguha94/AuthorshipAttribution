           The Joys of Complab Comps and C++    I hate the computers we get for class; nothing ever works properly in this school. This is pathetic and yet amusing at the same time...Every two minutes the computer  insists  on informing me that the lab printer has run out of paper. This is all well and good, but  I just don't give a damn  AND the printer is stocked with enough paper in the damn tray...I know. I checked. The damn popup is starting to get really goddamned annoying. ARRGH. Heh. Updating the blog during C++, whee! Anyway...  Would someone out there who knows C++ mind telling me what's wrong with this code? My professor wrote it on the board  as is ; I keep having compiling problems with it, and he refuses to explain the code further. He says it should compile fine but I can't get the damn thing to work. I feel like this code is  missing some fundamental pieces , but I can't figure it out -- and the fact that he says it should work fine  the way it is now  isn't helping.  #include   #include    main() { 	int i=0, n; 	char inbuf [1000]; 	char * names [100];  	cout  	cin.getline (inbuf,1000);  		while (inbuf [0] != '\0')  		{ 			intlen = strlen(inbuf); 			names[i]=newchar(len+1); 			strcpy(names[i], inbuf); 			i++; 			cout  			cin.getline (inbuf,1000); 		} }  Anyone? Anyone???  I think I'm gonna start yelling at this man in a few minutes; this is getting ridiculous. Blaargh.
