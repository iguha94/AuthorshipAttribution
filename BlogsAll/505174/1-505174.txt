         Did I mention that I suffer from insomnia at times? Last night was one of those nights when no matter how dead tired I was, I just couldn't fall asleep.

They will do whatever is necessary to preserve that balance, even if it means switching allegiances suddenly.    Race:   Elves  are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently conccern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.    Primary Class:   Fighters  are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.    Secondary Class:   Bards  are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.
