           Congrats to Meg---errr...Jane Galt...    She made WSJ's Best of the Web email today for her   reflective post on what happened at the WTC ....  :)  [sorry if I'm late on this, but I just got the new email about 5 minutes ago...]  Who Is Jane Galt? She's a recovery worker at the World Trade Center site, and she's got a blog, on which she's posted some of her reflections on her months at ground zero.   Excellent. I'm still waiting for the address/website of the place where you can submit posts for the Blogger book...Can anyone help me? I'd like to submit her post as well...            Here's another job I would love to do:   Military Interrogation . The only problem I have with it is the fact that I'd have to do all that military training in order to get into it...Which rots...Since I  know  that I wouldn't last 2 minutes in boot camp. Heh. But on the upside, at least I know this! Anyway...            What a nice way to hammer the nails into your own coffin:   Saudi Telethon Host Calls for Enslaving Jewish Women . What...the...fuck!? I was hoping to see "The Onion" somewhere in that link, but I realized a few things:  A.) I don't think that even the Onion would stoop that low B.) It's so fucked up, it has to be real.  I don't know what else to say. My mind is boggled with the stupidity and arrogance that these people continually show.  Never a dull moment, huh...
