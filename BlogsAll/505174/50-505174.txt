           For some reason...    This article about the   predicted post-9/11 baby boom  really hasn't gotten much attention; so far I've only seen two people discuss it. I like what   Pej wrote  about it; he gets it right on, but I'm not too sure what to think about   Denton 's viewpoint. *shrug*  Sorry, I guess I'm just more along the lines of what Pej was thinking.  As for me? I love kids. Kids are wonderful! ...As long as their mommies come back soon to get them. Right now. NOW~!  I honestly can't see myself as a mother anytime soon; hell I can barely take care of myself, how would I expect to take care of a kid? *shudder*   One day though. One day I would love to have a daughter, to bring joyous fear into the world. She will be beautiful, intelligent, strong-minded and she will not take shit from anyone. I would love to see my daughter wreak havoc and have fun and break hearts and be successful and live a wonderful life.   One day...But not now.    But when that day comes... fear .     >:)               UPDATE [5/30 - 4:45pm]:  Well, add in one more person who has decided to talk about this...  Clay says  it's not gonna be that big of a deal.
