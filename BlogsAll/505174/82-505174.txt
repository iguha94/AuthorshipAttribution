           It's a Monday, but who cares?    Well, besides   Paul , who's not ready for it. [He also has a neatly-linked write-up of the event. :) ]  Ken delivers with humor his   own account of the party  and joy! He still has his thesaurus handy! Doc Weevil has   answered my plea  for   party pictures  and Jim [like Leonard] was apprehensive about the people who were going to the party but it seems like he walked away with a   good opinion  of us...  Elizabeth  also had a good time and Jessica was among those who stayed until closing time [although, *sniffle* she and the others didn't care about the outcome of Paraguay-Germany...Ah well, I'm the only one really with some sort of stake in it and I didn't even really care, lol!] Missed   Caryn  but she reports that she had fun as well and has some amusing advice to female bloggers. [Just as long as you remember that some of the people there will be spoken for...]  It's cool to see so many different reactions, especially from the "first-timers" -- All this apprehension!  We really  aren't  some weird blogger cult [unless you count Queen Galt's court...J/K!!] nor are we computer-crazed blog-addicted sociopaths so it's all good. :)   On another note,   Mike  has a beautiful post about his father and cars. I thought he was cool before, but damn...he just gained some more points for that. Awesome post.  Also, Nick Denton is   working on a project  called the   Blogallery  and is currently accepting pictures according to a criteria that he as posted. So far the collection is pretty cool...  Well, I aced my first final -- Now it's time for lunch and preparation for my next final...Humanities. Joy.    Let's see how this plays out.
