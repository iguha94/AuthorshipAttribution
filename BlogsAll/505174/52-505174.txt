           A Small Tirade (?) for   Sasha .     [Originally posted on May 27th, sometime around 5ish -- I feel the need to say this since Blogger decided to fuck with it and republish it with today's date for some ungodly reason. I'm really starting to hate Blogger now...]   I wasn't going to say anything; I wasn't going to get into it. The memories still hurt. The images are burned into my skull. My anger still smolders. I figured, who would give a damn? I'm no one special;   unlike others , my opinions don't matter and I'm not a   coherent writer  with the right words to move people. All I have is myself. But fuck it. I will say something because it needs to be said, if not for anything but to say it and get it off my conscious. Today of all days, because my heart is heavy even as my soul rages against the images that are in my head.   I made the picture in the previous post for the "front page" of my school's online newspaper a few days after the tragedy. I needed to  do something , to  create something , no matter how small, to try to work through the pain and try to conquer such blatant destruction, knowing full well that the pain would never leave. I remember that day, waking up, hearing my mom hysterically crying and turning on the TV just in time to see the second plane smash into the tower. I remember being fuzzyheaded with sleep watching the horror, not really comprehending, silently thanking God that I wasn't in the city that day, right before I woke up.Then everything hit me all at once and I realized that this was actually happening.   The cell phone still worked for a few...before everyone who knew I was going to school close to the city started trying to call to see if I was still alive. In between that I was trying to reach the people I knew in the city to make sure they were alive. I remember calling the different companies where my friends worked, no answers, no names, no nothing. Staying glued to the TV to see if I recognized any faces. Switching channels, hoping that I wouldn't see a body with a face I recognized. Continued calls to the different companies, telling them I was a cousin, a sister, anything to get information. Nothing. Half the time it was busy signals, the other half it was the recording, "All circuits are busy now, please try your call again later." Insanity. Pandemonium. Crying until my eyes felt like they were pouring blood instead of tears. Hatred, all-consuming hatred for the fuckers who did this. Sitting on the couch, feeling myself shaking with hatred and fear and outrage and horror and the burning desire for vengeance.  I remember the days after this. Taking the train to school; watching the solidarity between strangers as there was a group therapy session, as people recounted stories of co-workers and friends who were lost. Choking on the smell and the cloud of dust that lingered in the air. Constantly crying because there was no other response.  It seemed simpler back then. Cut and dry. You fucked with us. You killed our innocents. You will pay.   Now it's all convoluted; the politicians live up to their undecisiveness and their desire to hear their own voices. They talk when they should act, they second-guess themselves and ponder trivial meaningless crap while those who fucked with us run free. Before, they stood behind the military they sent out to do their jobs; now it seems like all has been forgotten while they ponder other issues that come to their attention.   It is time. Shut your mouths, politicians.  Either ACT, or let us fight.  Avenge those who died so that you can sit there and ponder your trivial meaningless crap.   I was not alive to witness the World Wars and I thank God for this. But I did see the Towers fall, and to hear those who survived through those wars call Ground Zero a warzone was devastating.  I saw a bumpersticker the other day that made me cry. It had a picture of the American flag and the words: "All Gave Some; Some Gave All" on it. With the memories in my head and a remembrance of the past, I thank those who gave the ultimate sacrifice...Be they Military or Civilian. I know they're being rewarded.          All Gave Some      Some Gave All      I know I will never forget.
