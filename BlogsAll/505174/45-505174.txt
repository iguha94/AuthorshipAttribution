         Somewhere in Minnesota there's a place called   Bemidji  (try pronouncing THAT name if you're an outsider like me!) which is home to a   college  where   Professor Morgan  teaches a first-year English course whose focus/major project for the semester is   observing blogs . The only reason why I know this is because one day, I checked my site stats and found a hit from their   "e-classroom" . My extreme curiosity got the best of me so I  just had  to sign up to their e-classroom and see what all the fuss was about! Apparently,   Margaret Jirik  had considered my blog for her project and others from her class decided to stop by for a visit. After reading over her posts, my next thought was, "A class that focuses on blogging? Interesting... must...learn...more... " and I sent an email to the professor asking him to clarify and explain his class to me. He was courteous, pleasant and quick to respond and from his reply I could see that he's a very organized and creative professor.   So far the class looks interesting; I'm starting to take an active part within it as a student has decided to take me up on my offer to help while Professor Morgan has given me the go-ahead to post and reply to his students as I see fit in order to help them with their research. I'm pretty happy with that.    :D    Let's see how this goes...
