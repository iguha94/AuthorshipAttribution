           Yay for Sylvia.    Apparently this kid who I completely hated during my time in Boston has kept a livejournal. Heh. The kid was a self-serving, egotistical, arrogant, short-sighted, ignorant dumbfuck looking for instant gratification and so full of himself...and he had no idea as to why most people weren't cool with him. Heh! Read over a few entries and well, I guess some things never change. Bleh. No love lost there; he annoyed the hell out of me. However he did have some funny i-quizzes that I took and c/p'd the results to   Feeding My Addicion . Gotta love that.            Anyway, there were so many different articles on the tribute for the last day of searching that I haven't had time to read them all...but as usual,   Pej has written a beautiful post  regarding it. Go read it. NOW. NOW!!!            Some interesting/strange/ aroo ? things from around the blogosphere:  Two things to file under "What the FUCK?!": Apparently an   11-year-old girl gave birth to her child by a 75-year-old man  in Connecticut [link via   Cut on the Bias ]; the father has said that he was "seduced" by the then-10-year-old. Kids giving birth to kids -- that poor child's gonna be one fucked up individual when she realizes just what has happened to her...Then again in a world where   Abercrombie & Fitch sells thongs to pre-teens  I guess anything is possible...  I'm not sure what to think about this sick article about a 15-year-old child prodigy who fell hard at the hands of her school's football team. ["  Out of Control ", link via   Sullivan  under "Sexual Abuse and Sports"]. She was 15; out of her peer group, she was isolated and forced to be alone until she found "acceptance" when some football players decided to get "friendly" with her. It's sick because the school did nothing to help her in favor of building up their school's football program, but at the same time, when she was asked if something was going on, she said nothing was wrong. Read it for yourself. I'm not sure what to think.             This article about   photography of the WTC  [via   Vodkapundit ] made me think about my photographical work. I know for a fact that I couldn't go down and take pictures of the site...Hell, I couldn't be near the site without nearly breaking down every time. The only thing I tried to take pictures of was the Tribute in Light. But I know what the writer is talking about; some of the pictures that I have seen are...I don't know. Awe-inspiring. They hit me on two levels; I'm either awed by the beauty of the photograph that stands as a marker for those who died and awed by the fact that someone dared to take such a picture. I know I couldn't.            For something funnier [I'm sure a lot of you will be dancing the happy dance at this news],   Jay Reading reports  that   Ren & Stimpy are making a comeback . I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry; that show was the bane of my existance when I was younger, but now that I'm older I can appreciate the hilarity of it all. Hrrrm...  Last funny thing comes from the caffeinated   Banana Counting Monkey ;   What Women Want in the Star Wars Universe !  I fell out of my chair laughing at #9, #8, #7, and of course...#1. >:)             Joy! I like the happier and funnier things in life. Nothing like talking to Sylvia to make me laugh my ass off...But now I think I'm going to log for a while, go outside and see the sunshine.   See you all later...
