         Today is a good day. I woke up hungry.  This may sound strange, but yes, it is a  good  thing. This means that my metabolism has kicked in for the day and is working properly. How do I know? I kept a 2-week food journal for my weight trainer so she could see what my eating habits were like. Each day I would write down what I ate, how hungry I felt eating it, what time I was eating and other such relevent things. I don't feel that hungry most days and becasue of this, I don't eat. This has always been looked on as " good " and worthy of praise in my family; especially by my mother. My trainer on the other hand, after looking over my papers, was none too happy. She told me that I seriously needed to change my eating habits. That, I expected, but not the explanation to follow:  1.) I am making the correct choices of food 2.) I am not feeling hungry because my metabolism has shut down. It is not working properly because: --- a.) I don't eat enough --- b.) I don't eat regularly  3.) Even though I am eating the right things, I could help myself lose more weight by asking for "light", "low fat" things -- such as low-fat cheese 4.) It's good to fall into a timed eating routine but bad to fall into a food eating routine   They are mostly healthy choices, although she would like to see an increase in my consumption of vegetables  Because of these 2 reasons, my body thinks it's being starved to death, and so it stores everything I eat as fat   e.g. -- It's good to eat at the same  time  every day, but bad to eat the same  things  every day  This was the weirdest thing to hear: I needed to eat... more ??? But I can see the logic in that. There are days that I just don't eat a damn thing at all because I just  don't feel hungry ...it's obvious that I am not eating enough to keep my body going.    As I'm writing this, I'm getting hungry....I'll finish this after I get something to eat!
