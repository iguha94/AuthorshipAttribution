         Yeah.   I'm human and yesterday...my Ego and my Pride both got kicked in the head. This infuriated my Jealous side, which, in a fit of rage, bitch-slapped my Depressive Nature out of its hibernation, who in turn, woke up and immediately went into overdrive. Yeap, that about sums it up. Heh.   Yeah I must've been  great  to be around yesterday.   Ok, I'll admit it; as much as I want to disregard this, I'm only human. How would  you  feel if the coolest thing imaginable to you right at the moment happened and you missed out and the next day your best friend tells you how cool it was? That they went, had a shitload of fun...and then you get to read everyone else's opinions on the event [which pretty much boils down to "This was awesome! This kicked ass! Let's do it again!"] ...while you were left out? Yeah. I thought so. I think the thing that hit me the hardest was that...knowing how cool this is blogging thing is to me, no one let me know. Hell, I would have called and said, "Hey, check this shit out! Maybe you might not think it's cool but...check it out anyway, here's what's happening." Yeah, that hurts. But whatever, I'll get over it. I know I'm probably making a big deal out of nothing but...yeah, it hurts. So I'll just kinda sit back today, do my laundry, let these  stupid feelings  run their course and make myself get over it.   Yeah.  Anyway, my mom returned home today. This is fun. So far, nothing big has happened; I think the jet lag is still screwing with her system. Maybe I'll get lucky and she won't mess with me for a while...I need some time to myself. And yeah, I'll keep up with this blog thing...Thanks  Evo , thanks  Chris !! So I guess people actually do read this thing!      :)    Yeah. :)
