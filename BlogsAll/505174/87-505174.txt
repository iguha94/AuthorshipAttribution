           Caw caw, BANG! ...FUCK! I'm dead...    Ahhh, the joys of your favorite movie and knowing all the words in and out of context. Hearing the movie score and knowing exactly where you are in the movie just by where the music is and seeing the images unfold in the screen of your memory.   "People used to think that when someone dies, a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead. But sometimes...Just sometimes...the crow brings that soul back to set the wrong things right."  "Don't move! "  "I thought the cops always said freeze."  "Well I said, don't move. You move Snow White and you're dead." "And I say I'm dead...And I move."  "Little things always meant so much to Shelly. I always used to think they were kind of trivial. Believe me,  nothing  is trivial."  "Mother is the name for God on the lips and hearts of all children...Do you understand?"  And of course, my favorite...  "It can't rain all the time..."  "Eric?"  or as sung by   he who died : "It can't rain all the time / the sky won't fall forever / and though the night seems long / your tears won't fall forever"   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   *smiles warmly*  Yeah, my favorite movie. Been a while since I watched it; I remember watching it all the damn time when I was younger, understanding what played out on screen because I had memorized the comic; J. O'Barr's The Crow.  "There is a man / playing a violin / and the strings / are the nerves in his arm "  "Ou sont les neiges d'antan?"  "Mine?" "Forever." "Only forever?" "Forever and ever."  "Sometimes I dream of sleepiness. Sometimes I feel like I'm alive."  "We do not recognize our souls until they are in pain..."  (i know why Jesus wept, motherfucker)  Beautiful work wrought out of pure pain, put in print and shared with the masses in a vain attempt to deal with the deep sadness and loss O'Barr felt. If only they knew; if only they read the graphic novel, in which one of his friends, John Bergin [better known to me from the experimental-industrial band:   Trust/Obey ] wrote a moving introduction to, of which I will post the first paragraph:    One day you are going to lose everything you have. Nothing will prepare you for that day. Not Faith...Not Religion...Nothing. When someone you love dies, you will know emptiness...You will know what it is to be completely and utterly alone. You will never forget and never forgive. The lonely do not usually speak as completely and as intimately as James O'Barr does here in this book - So, if anything, at least take this lesson from  The Crow : think about what you have to lose.     Pain.   Fear.   Irony.   Despair.   Death.   The titles of the original five comics; although good luck to you if you want to find them in their original form. Easier however to find them all in the one compendium known as the graphic novel. Each title came with an...explanation of sorts. These two hit home long ago and still do even today...  From Fear: He screams and screams and pounds his head against the wall until wailing phantom firetrucks race across his vision.        All he wants is  pain .         Pain  and  hate . Yes hate. We shall never forget and never forgive.        But never  fear .        Fear is for the Enemy.         Fear  and  bullets .  From Death: It's not death if you refuse it...It is if you accept it.   ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~   It's been awhile since I've watched the movie, but I still remember it as clearly as if I had seen it yesterday. The book I've read countless times and memorized the quotes that stayed close to me.   The things that strike at your heart and soul never leave you. Such is what The Crow has done; the sorrow and sadness and pain and loss and love undying that was conveyed within the inked pages will never leave me and I hope to God I never experience the pain of losing my beloved as O'Barr had done.  But I do feel the pain of losing friends, even if such is not on the same scale.     I remember. I will never forget.  And I will never, ever fear.    Fear is for the Enemy. Fear and bullets.
