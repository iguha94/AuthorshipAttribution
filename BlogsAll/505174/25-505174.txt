         Ah, Lansdowne Street...A one-block strip behind Fenway Park chock-full of trashy clubs [as well as normal bars, fun pubs and   Jillian's  at the end of the street but you'd never know it by the massive amounts of clubgoers]; the land of drunken-eurotrash fat sausage sluts and skinny stick bastards. Did I mention that they were multi-millionaire bastards who drive Mazaratis and Lamborghinis?? Heh. Gotta love that. Yes, the meeting ground for primped-up wanna-be fat chicks in skin-tight lam shirts and spandex-riddled mini-skirts that stumble around in their huge platform shoes too drunk to realize that the sober rich guys aren't interested and the ones who seem interested are blinded by their beer-goggles.   Sausages and sticks; welcome to the land of the sexual shishkabob.   So of course we have to go down there tonight to amuse ourselves and laugh at the drunkards... :)  Yeap. You have to pass them by in order to get to Jillian's anyway so...Might as well amuse ourselves in the process!  Oh yeah... I'm in love with   Mr. Nice ...Must be that accent, baby!  ;)   [If anyone knows what show his song is from, please let me know...I recognize it but I can't think of where it's from; please help me!]  And...staying true to the cause...Here's another result to an internet test [thanks Nick...  ;) ]: __________________________________________________________________________________   Hey ho, you're Calibretto!  Kick. Arse.  Five metric tonnes of hulking, steam powered robo-meat, you are the pin-up boy for death robot technology. Although you are in fact a war golem, you know how to use a minigun, and you can benchpress small settlements. Relatively new to the colossal death robot scene, you were first pencilled by comic legend Joe Maduriera in 1998. Sensitive, stylish, and yet still massive, if you were female and not made of iron I would probably propose to you.  You can tell the world I love you with the following image of truth:      Which Colossal Death Robot Are  You ?   So...apparently I have a proposal waiting for me by the creator of this internet test.  Heh. >:)
