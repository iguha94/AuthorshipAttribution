         Ahhhh, the joy of listening to my launchcast internet radio station. Complete with commercials every 10 songs...heh.  So apparently yesterday was   Get a Different Name Day ...So I decided to switch my name to "Catalina Jaguaravenwolf" for the few remaining hours of said "holiday". Heh. mIRC fun at its best!  So I'm already 45 minutes into Valentine's Day.  Feels like any other old normal everyday Thursday to me. I have to run some errands later on today...such as:   Bring my car into the shop for her inspection  Go sweat my ass off at the gym to further my dreams of weightloss  Drop off my B&W film to get developed  Finish up some labs for C++  Type up my half of the report for the debate  Other random things that my sleep-dep'd mind can't think of right now but will remember to do tomorrow  Heh, leave it to my dad to try to cheer me up on the holiday he knows I hate the most: he got me this really funny Valentine's Day card...Really amusing! Made me laugh my ass off for at least 20 minutes...IT was great!  So I think I'll actually disengage myself from the computer for a little while and go get some sleep...  Yeah, I think I'll be ok this Valentine's Day.  I'm holding onto this unusual Optimism for as long as possible...   :)
