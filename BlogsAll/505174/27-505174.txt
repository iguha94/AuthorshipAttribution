         I've come to the realization that I am addicted to taking random internet tests. Well I guess there's an upside to this...Maybe I'll begin to understand myself better. Hell, I just found out that there's a nice and neat little label to describe my [what for years I considered to be weird and dysfunctional] personality...and they even made it sound wonderful!!!  Come on..."Idealist/Champion"??  That makes me feel  sooo much better  about myself...so...I guess it's  all good .  Heh.  With that in mind, I have taken yet another test; this time on   Ethical Philosophy . What follows are my results. [And no, there wasn't a #20!]  Enjoy...  >:)   1.  Kant   (100%)  2.  Mill   (93%)  3.  Sartre   (81%)   4.  Prescriptivism   (75%)  5.  Rand   (75%)  6.  Bentham   (74%) 7.  Aquinas   (68%)   8.  Aristotle   (67%) 9.  Epicureans   (60%)   10.  Spinoza   (59%)   11.
