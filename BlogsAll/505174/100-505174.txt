           Wow.    I hate my modem; it's toying with me, I swear it! Heh. On a completely different note, I never thought webcams would be so addicting! A friend of mine just got one and it's weird; all it shows is one person as they type in front of the computer and their reactions to what comes up on the screen. Yet...it's addicting. Weirdness. *shrug* Then again, I never considered how addicting blogs would be either, so....Joy.   Vacation is going well as it leaves me enough extra time at the gym and the chance to try yoga. Of course, I cracked my ankle today so I'll probably have to forego yoga this week.Grrrr. I rather  like  yoga; it is the one thing out there that actually  challenges  my insane powers of flexibility. I also signed up for kickboxing...unfortunately my messed up ankle is going to get in the way of my first class. Bleh. This rots. Ah well. I missed out on the mechanics course I wanted to take; registration ended the two weeks ago, but I guess that's a good thing since there's still a chance that I can sign up for my massage therapy course.   Quick shout out to my friend Sylvia who's recovering from getting all four impacted wisdom teeth removed...Hope the codeine is working!  So that's the quick update...Now I'm gonna pass out and hope that my cable modem stays connected.    :)
