           Awwww,  so  glad to see you care...    So, I'm a part of this BlogSnob thing; it sounded amusing so I signed up. It's free, it's wonderful, random people stop by to visit and say hello [hello   Katrina !] and some even stay awhile. However, what happens when people get rejected? Some turn to their thesaurus for comfort:    Look at who they accepted. They are pedantic, arid, dry, dull, dunces, chuckleheads, dopey, dumbheads, noodles, schnooks, bleary eyed, blockheaded, dense, doltish, dull, dumb, numbskulls, pinheads, thick, retarded, simple, asinine, fatuous, foolish, silly, oafish, sluggish, half-assed, crass, backwards, idiotic, nitwits, witless, vacuous, irrational, ignorant, scatterbrained, dippy, irrational, wacked-out, absurd, preposterous, and sappy.    Why doesn't anyone like me?    Yes, each word was linked to a fellow BlogSnob...I'm filed under "blockheaded". Awww, I feel the love!  ...Actually, I'm miffed.  You read my blog and walked away angry and upset because I got accepted into a webring and you didn't [and  that, in itself  is quite amusing]...and the only word you could come up with was "blockheaded"??  Why couldn't I have been "irrational", "absurd" or even "wacked-out"? I mean, come on, you list "irraional"  twice ...Damn, a quick stop at   Thesaurus.com  with the word "blockhead" left me with two main categories ("Fool" and "Imbecile") that led to more interesting choices. I could have been any of the following: "simpleton", "witling", "dizzard", "ninny", "nincompoop", "zany" [although I rather like the word zany], "babbler" -- and that's just under the "Fool" category. Next time put some effort into it!  Ok I'm done now. Heh.    Oh, and...By the way.... Thanks for all the hits!      >:)
