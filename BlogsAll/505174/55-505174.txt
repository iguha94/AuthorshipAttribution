             Friday Five  thingy returns...    And it's about the thing I do best.  Dreaming.  HEH!    >:)     1. What's the last vivid dream that you remember having?   Last night. I always have vivid dreams; I tend to remember most of them too. Some I don't care to remember, others I never want to forget.    2. Do you have any recurring dreams?   Yeap!! Some of the dreams I have are like episodes; there's one in which I'm sort of an assassin/spy/hitwoman and every so often I get a "new episode".    3. What's the scariest nightmare you've ever had?   I'm not going to tell and for a few reasons: a.) it's  way  too personal b.) it's not something I'd be comfortable sharing c.) someone out there who hates me can use it against me   4. Have you ever written your dreams down or considered it? Why or why not?   Yes. I've written down some of the ones that I never want to forget.    5. Have you ever had a lucid dream? What did you do in it?    Yes, many times; I dream lucidly often. I call them "learning dreams" -- Usually these dreams answer a question or solve a problem; I learn what I need to do in these dreams. There's way too many of them to recount here, so I'll just leave that alone. :)
