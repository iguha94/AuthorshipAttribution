           Thanks, Support, and an Update    Well, my internet connection has been shot to shit for the past couple of days and I haven't been able to do a damn thing online for awhile. I just wanted to thank everyone for their support with my dog Lucky's crisis. The next morning, my father took Lucky to the vet to get her checked out. I was knocked out for most of the morning because of the asthma/breathing issues; my dog has since returned to me alive and as strong as can possibly be (considering it all). I don't know what miracle that vet has done, but she's walking, (although she still favors her hindquarters) and still pretty strong (as in she nearly tears my arm off trying to get free whenever we're outside and she spies a squirrel bolting for a tree). At night though, she gets noticably weaker and she continuously whines as she is scared to be alone. The vet gave us a large bottle of pills and she needs to be on a regimen for the rest of her life, yet, no one will tell me how long she has left. She's a great dog and has lived a damn good life so far...I'm happy that we still have some time left together.   On a trivial note, the blog has gone through some updates. As you can see, it is pretty plain if you came here through the Blogspot link. I've created a new page and remade my blog into what I had originally pictured in my mind during my first Web Development class and the end result is here:   Updated Randomness . Feel free to look around and let me know if anything doesn't work. The only thing that I think will give me problems is the fonts I chose to use, but like I said, feel free to let me know if you see any problems. I can probably fix it later on...(Yay for classtime.)     So let me just thanks again to everyone who has helped me through my and my dog's crisis. It's nice to know that there's support out there.
