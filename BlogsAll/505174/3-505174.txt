         And so I was a bit depressed yesterday. The Victoria's Secret swimsuit catalogue came in and I was immersed in the wonderful world of beautiful swimsuits draped on equally beautiful lean female bodies that I will never attain no matter how hard I work out. It must be great having the lithe body-type, the fine bone-sturcture and the overactive metabolism that allows these models to have such lithe, lean bodies.   Damn them.   Trust me, it  sucks  having a bone-structure/body-type that would easily lend itself to be the perfect  linebacker  had I been born  male . Add in the non-functional metabolism and all the excess poundage of flesh that I'm carrying around...and...well...let's just say it was very tempting to run out and buy some chocolate to pig out on. Although I must say, I am proud of myself. I was able to get to the end of the catalogue  without :   crying  throwing stuff  putting my fist through a wall  pigging out on whatever food i could find  >:  Yeah...So, I'm just gonna hit the gym like I always do later on today and continue my fight to lose the excess poundage. I realize that I'll never have the body of a swimsuit model, but hell, I'll be happy if I could just  fit  into a swimsuit [sometime this year]. This...just... ROTS .  Heh.       That's it !!!      In my next life, I'm coming back as a fucking swimsuit model.  Either that or a superstar football player...If I'm gonna be stuck with the damn body of a linebacker, might as well get some goddamn use out of it.
