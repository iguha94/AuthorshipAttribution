           Something else that amused me...    So I'm driving around listening to Drudge on the radio [the man's voice astounds me for some odd reason] and I hear something that makes me wonder if the "  Baron of the Browser " has spent too much time over at   The Onion ...  There are man-eating fish in some pond in Maryland. Apparently, these things can grow up to 3 feet in length and can survive out of water for a time (long enough to catch and eat ducks and geese feeding by the water). Residents by the pond are calling to blow up the pond with dynamite in order to kill these freaky fish before they spawn and infect other bodies of water.   I nearly crashed my car, I was laughing so hard.   Yet there was no explanation as to who was killed and eaten by these fish to brand them "man-eating" so I'm assuming I missed the explanation in a fit of static over the radio waves. Heh. Insanity!   I want a few for my pond; then maybe these damn canadian geese will get the damn message that we don't want them around. (I   hate   canadian geese!!!! They're fucking  everywhere  and you can track them by their mess. ARRGH. I want to shoot them all and have roast goose for dinner. Damn laws. Grrr.)   Heh.  Well I needed something to laugh over today since my mom's dog Blanca suddenly had fits of seizures all this afternoon. She's going to the vet tomorrow to get checked out. At least I have something to take my mind off things; I'm currently painting my   CAV miniatures  (here's the   official gallery ). Painting is therapeutic; so far I have 2 units finished and 3 more started. At least I can control how my minis look.   I hope tomorrow is a better day.    :/
