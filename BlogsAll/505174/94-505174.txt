           SQL and kittens...    Nothing like posting during class. Before the bane of my existance is C++, but it has since been replaced by Database 1. Right now we're learning how to create databases in SQL; so far, it's pretty damned easy, but the professor is Russian and her accent is thicker than molasses. Luckily she uses a lot of powerpoint slides to teach the class. However, I have the feeling that she suffers from OCD over anything feline. Every class password is named after a great cat; the screen saver of her computer is a pink background over which  numerous  pictures of kittens float over. Cute, fluffy, fuzzy-wuzzy goddamned fucking kittens! It makes my head hurt looking at it. Insanity.   Something interesting that Blitz found online...  Vertical Tanks . (Warning, the site itself is in Japanese. Just look for the links like "Cockpit", "VT", things of that nature.) Looks damn good so far...I know it's coming out for Xbox, but the preview has keyboard instructions for you to try the game for about 2 seconds. There's 5 things you have to do to just power up the mecha; once you do everything right it brings up a nice looking HUD with readouts and whatnot. It looks like it's gonna kick some major ass, but I wish you could actually move the mecha out of the bay in the trial screen. Heh.  Hrrrm...What else? Talked to another friend of mine from HS today on AIM; looks like he's gonna be an officer in the Marines. Niiice...  Excellent. Database is OVER! (Sadly this post took about 45 mins to create inbetween furiously typing class notes and whatnot...blaargh!) Joy....But....It's OVER!!!! Whee!  (God, I  hate  kittens...)
