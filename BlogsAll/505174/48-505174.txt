           Sick.    I wish I was had a copy of The Sun so I could read the article he was discussing, but either way   Clay still found it disgusting ; a story about how a father spelled out his hopes for his son [the suicide bomber who set himself off in an ice cream shop]...How he wished his son would have been a  nuclear bomb  instead of a  normal bomb .  These are the  people  scum we are dealing with here.    Normal  parents want the best for their children and usually discuss their futures with pride; dreams and hopes that their children will be successful and happy with what they do with their lives. Since, who knows? Maybe their child will be the doctor that cures cancer or a future Olympian.   It makes me sick and angry to see these  people  scum sacrifice their children for a cause that they believe in. I don't have kids, but I sure as hell know that if my kids were in danger, nothing would stop me from keeping them safe. Nothing. I'd make sure that they were safe at all costs, even if my life is forfeit. If it was my life or theirs, I'd die. Pure and simple. I'm sure that most parents would agree with me.   If the future is so important to these so-called parents, let  them  strap on the bombs so that their children can grow and decide the future for themselves. In fact, I think these so-called parents should gather together celebrate their hatred and blow themselves up in one big bang. They don't deserve to live.
