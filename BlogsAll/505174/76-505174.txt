            Well, if you  insist ...    Fed up with your normal Walk-a-Thons and Bike-a-Thons for a good cause? Then this might just be the   fundraiser  for you...Now, here's my question:  how do they know you're...uh...participating? Honor system, Shmonor system; that's still kinda scary, don't you think? Weirdness...but hey, since they're twisting arms for membership, maybe you all should join in...   >:)   Oh yeah, did you happen to realize that this is the FOURTH ANNUAL event?!  Hah!              On a completely   DIFFERENT NOTE  , go to a Baskin Robbins near you for a   free scoop of ice cream!   Heh, I should charge for these plugs... ;)             UPDATE:    So I went to my local Baskin Robbins to revel in the free ice cream...only to realize that i was a half-hour late on the promotional. HEH! Well, I must have looked pitiful since the guys gave it to me anyway; that and I was the  only one  who was brave enough to try the ice cream named "Tax Crunch". Don't let the "Tax" in the name fool you; it's  damn good !  Yummy chocolate goodness.   Well, until next year...And hopefully I'll remember to check the times on these promotionals...LOL!
