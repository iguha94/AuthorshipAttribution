           These    are    the    faces    of    your     CHILDREN  ...   What    are    you    teaching    them !?  They're CHILDREN for crying the fuck out loud! So young, 3, 4, 5 (?) year olds, their parents dressing them up in fatigues with toy guns and grenade accessories; 7, 8, 9 (?) year old girl being paraded around with fake exploses strapped to her small body. What the hell are you doing?! What is your damn problem?! They're CHILDREN! Children who should be enjoying their childhood, going to school, running around without a care in the world...imagining what they will be when they grow up and playing with their friends. But no, you created this ridiculous war and ripped the innocence away from your children, trying to turn them into monsters like you. Bastards, you've succeeded; when teenagers feel that their lives are so horrible, so unimportant and non-consequential...when they have lost all hope for a real life and feel that they have nothing left to give to this world except the deaths of others by taking their own, you have succeeded. They should know nothing of this so young; all they want is the love and acceptance of their families, to make them proud. This is what you show them, tell them? "If you love us and want to make us proud, strap on this belt of explosives and go blow up that building." Disgusting. So young and already you're trying to stuff their heads with meaningless hate.   Die. Just die; kill yourselves quietly, take the gun to your own head and pull the trigger. Don't send your children to do your dirty work. Just because you feel you were cheated and had, don't force your children to do the same. NORMAL PARENTS WANT ONLY THE BEST FOR THEIR CHILDREN; THEY WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO  GO FORTH IN THE WORLD AND EXCEL, TO FULFILL THEIR DREAMS AND LIVE BETTER LIVES THAN WHAT THEY THEMSELVES AS CHILDREN HAVE LED.   So kill yourselves. Give your children the chance to dream, to LIVE...without your meddling. The deserve at least a CHANCE at LIFE.
