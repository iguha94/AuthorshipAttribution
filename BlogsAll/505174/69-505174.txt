           WSJ's BotW email is finally back...    ...But there really wasn't anything that I really liked.   I don't know, nothing really drew me...So I'll just leave you with some  old ,  odd  things that I happen to find amusing [then again, this could just be the sleep-deprivation talking so I really wouldn't know].  I started out having a bad day today but it progressively got better; things are looking up!            First up is   And they danced...  I have no idea how to explain this other than it's  really  strange; something about the TECHNO! part of it though makes this worth it...Yeah, it's old, but I still like it.  Second is Rachael Klein of the  Daily Californian  -- She happens to write the sex column and I happen to  love  her blatant and blunt way of telling things like it is. This is her   latest article ...If for some reason the link doesn't work let me know.  Third is something that   Lane  found; it's called "  exploding dog ", a website where "Sam" has some [seemingly] simplistic drawings of different random phrases that get sent to him. [I say seemingly, because they look like something created in Flash or Fireworks, and I'm  still  learning how to maneuver in those progs so I know how difficult it is to get what you want...]  Fourth is Rolling Stones' two articles listing the "  50 Coolest Records " and conversely, its bi-polar opposite, the "  50 Uncoolest Records " -- I'm just neither since Rolling Stone and I seem to have a difference of opinion on what's cool...       My "Cool" stuff:  Massive Attack // Protection [I find it strange that the people at Rolling Stone know who they are...] Beck // Odelay [Personally, I liek Mellow Gold  much better  Michael Jackson // Off the Wall [On a RECORD!!! You know, those large weird circular black things with grooves on them? Heh, how much more old-skool can ya get?]  The Chemical Brothers // Dig Your Own Hole [It's the Chem. Bros...'Nuff Said.]       My "Uncool" stuff:  Weezer // Weezer [Can you say: geek rock? Yeah, this was the better album...Sadly.]  Meat Loaf // Bat Out of Hell [OK I take offense that this is on the "uncool" list...]  Pet Shop Boys // Actually [For odd some reason, I  love  the Pet Shop Boys...But I happen to like "Behavior." and "Very." much better.]         Lastly I have the   Guy's Guide to Geek Girls...Illustrated!  'Nuff said. However I don't remember where I got this link from, so...  However...It's time for sleepy.
