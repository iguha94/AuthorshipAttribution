           I love WSJ's emails...but I hate being the last to discuss them...Oh well...    I'll continue on anyway! LOL  So I get my Best of the Web email, read over the articles contained therein, formulate an opinion and then read my daily blogs. Sucks to see everyone else already commented on the things you thought were interesting...and they say everything better than you. Heh! Well, I don't care, I'm gonna talk about this stuff anyway because I like it. :P  Mr. Arnot was doing what he's paid to do; investigating things, reporting on them, doing what journalists normally do...No big deal. He videotaped what he saw fit, interviewed people, jotted down notes on his laptop and went about his business. Business as usual, yes? Surely, but he was in Saudi Arabia at the time; on a lay-over while heading home, officials asked him to step off the plane and speak with security. After that, all went to hell in a handbasket as they searched his belongings, looked over his tapes, confiscated everything and sent him on his way. Lovely. And this is   coming from another country who supposedly has freedom of the press ? Interesting...            Oh, I love the irony of it all...A group of Palestinians are "shocked and dismayed" at the fact that other, harder-hitting   political groups are using children as cheap weaponry to infiltrate settlements . This is in the wake of   3 boys arming themselves with homemade pipe bombs and knives who were shot dead by Israelian soldiers before they could do anything . I say, WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU EXPECT?!  Because for the most part and on the whole, these are the people who have taught their children that their lives are worthless and in order to make something of themselves and make their parents proud, they should blow themselves up to kill the enemy. This is apparent in the suicide note left by one of the boys:   "Oh mother, please be happy with me. I ask you to pray to God to make my martyrdom operation a success," wrote Zaqout. "I am giving my soul for the sake of God and the homeland."   And yet, his mother goes on to shift the blame elsewhere:  Zaqout's mother could hardly choke back her tears. "What can I say? They killed my boy," she sobbed.   Asked if she understood his motives, she said: "Children are tormented by what they see on television. Israel has left all Palestinians, including children, with no choice but to die."   WHAT?! You have got to be shitting me!! They are tormented because you have filled their heads with meaningless hate and stole their childhoods away from them! They are tormented because they may not fully comprehend what is going on and you stuff your ideology down their throats instead of explaining what is happening in the world around them! They are tormented because you are teaching them that their lives are fucking worthless and that they will never amount to anything! THAT IS WHY THEY ARE TORMENTED. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND THEIR LIVES. Just like everywhere else, you don't like what your kids see on TV? Turn that shit off and  talk  to them; spend some damn time with your kids!  THIS WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED IF YOU JUST GAVE THEM THE TIME OF DAY AND TOLD THEM THAT YOU LOVED THEM, THAT THEY WERE WORTH SOMETHING  ALIVE  AND ALLOWED THEM TO MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND THEM.    "It is despair, despair and more despair. Children are unable to cope with the sad reality," he told Reuters, adding that child suicide attackers were motivated more by an overwhelming sense of hopelessness than surging nationalism.   You are so "shocked" and "outraged" and "dismayed" that your children would do such a thing; that's saying something. LOOK AT WHAT YOU ARE TEACHING THEM.

Look at what you are shoving into their young, impressionable minds from the time they are able to walk! They can't cope because they can't escape it. They can't cope because what they see is that each and every suicide bomber is revered upon their death, moreso than they ever were in life! They have no self worth, they have no pride. Why? Think about it, you dumbfucks, think about what you are doing to your own children. You will not survive very long if even your children want to die before they are fully even alive.            On a happier note, there is a possibility that   there might not be an oil shortage after all ...  What the scientists suspect is that very old petroleum -- formed tens of millions of years ago -- has continued migrating up into reservoirs that oil companies have been exploiting for years. But no one had expected that depleted oil fields might refill themselves.  Now, if it is found that gas and oil are coming up in significant amounts, and if the same is occurring in oil fields around the globe, then a lot more fuel than anyone expected could become available eventually. It hints that the world may not, in fact, be running out of petroleum.   This is great news! Of course, I think that research should be continued with other forms of energy as well as the tried and true methods should be implemented more often [solar panels, electricity, etc] but still...great news!  OK enough on the emails...gonna look around the internet and see what else is out there...
