         Back to the daily grind of school. I'm currently working on an ongoing project for my E-Commerce class. It's interesting and fun so far...Then again, I eventually want to start my own business so the tips and tricks I'm learning right now will eventually help me in the long run.  Switching gears for a moment; my Best of the Web email came in with an interesting article   about a quick-thinking father who saved both his son's and his own life from two would-be armed robbers . Reading articles like this make me smile with pride; yes, there ARE still some people around with good, old-fashioned common sense.   Well, I finally have both of my evaluation results sitting here in front of me...The fight for my weight loss and a healthier me is very difficult...but damn it all, I'm proud of my accomplishments! I created a chart that would make the results easier to compare; but when I posted it to the blog, it didn't come out as well as I had hoped. Oh well; I'll have to make a .jpg out of it and throw it up on a website somewhere so that everyone can see it. Heh. Yeah I know I'm obsessing over this but it is something that has taken over my life and I feel the need to share my results. Who knows? Maybe I'll inspire someone out there who has has it with dieting and yet wants to lose weight. [Well, I can dream, can't I?]  Talking about dreaming...I dreamed of someone last night whom I haven't seen since elementary school; well, that's a lie, since I've seen him every so often as I got older, but still...that was odd. I think there's a message there but I have no clue as to what this message might be; maybe I'll get lucky and I'll actually see this person sometime soon. I can only hope; once he was my greatest of friends.   Well I'd love to continue my ramblings, but I really need to get at least a little bit of sleep; these super-early mornings are hell. Heh. A small sacrifice on my way to two degrees.   :)
