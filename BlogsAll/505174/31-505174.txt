           Nothing beats VAMPIRIC CARNAGE!!!    So I hopped in my car, drove over to Nick's house, picked him up and dragged him along with me to  finally  see Blade II earlier this evening; have to say it was  pure cheeeze and $fX , but damn those fight and death scenes ROCKED!  HELL YEAH! Have to give credit to Mr. Wesley Snipes; he makes vampires look damn cool to someone who loves werewolves....And I want his weaponry! AWESOME.  I have three things I really want to link to; the first is   an excellent post by Mike  [you know, the one who understands and appreciates us Tough Chicks] comparing young people of today and young people of past times. The angst is still there [obviously] but before, things were dealt with in a better way; you never saw such a high amount of kids picking up guns and going on rampages against their schoolmates. Go read it now. You should.   The second is this   awesome picture of the world at night  [via   Instapundit ] -- Nighttime is my favorite time; the time I feel most alive and in tune with myself...  The third is a site that   generates your very own Evil Plan  [  thanks to Pej  for a cool link! :) ]   Congratulations on being the creator of a new Evil Plan (tm)!   Your objective is simple:  Soul Accumulation . Your motive is a little bit more complex: Evil - It's my nature   Stage One  To begin your plan, you must first seduce a chosen one. This will cause the world to sit up and take notice, stunned by your arrival. Who is this unholy menace? Where did they come from? And why do they look so good in classic black?    Stage Two  Next, you will seize control of New York. This will cause countless hordes of supernatural creatures to flock to you, begging to do your every bidding. Your name will become synonymous with rage, as lesser men whisper your name in terror.    Stage Three  Finally, you will unleash your horsemen of the apocalypse, bringing about the end of all things. This will all be done from a Obsidian Citadel, an excellent choice if we might say.   These three deeds will herald the end, and the citizens of this planet will have no choice but to elect you their new god.  Trust us, it'll all come together in the end...  *giggles evilly and steeples her fingers*    Excellent.               One last thing before I go....  Uthant   FINALLY  got updated! WOO HOO!  OK go check that out now. :)
