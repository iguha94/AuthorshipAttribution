           Success!              So, Blogapalooza was a success! Whee! Had a ton of fun, although it was damn expensive: $9 for a tiny glass of Midori Sour.   :P   The weirdest thing was the moss garden; I kid yout not! Real moss too; I made the mistake of putting my palm on it...Ick! At least my allergies were nice to me and they didn't flare up. Lots of little rooms to sit and chat in which was pretty cool, but not the best when you want to keep track of everyone and try to meet everyone...Ah well. I know I'm gonna forget a lot of the new people I met so please forgive me...     :(    It was kinda strange being introduced to everyone as " The  sexiest female blogger in the Blogosphere!!!!" all the time, but I had to laugh! Hella funny stuff...  Nick and I came late to the party but it's all good; there were a lot of friendly faces that returned from last time:   Sasha  who wore this awesome blue silk kimono [?] and an InstaPundit t-shirt,   Ken  who shared a really funny story with me,   Paul  who promises that my shirt will be coming soon [   :D   ],   Doc , who as usual was snapping candid shots, and   Clay  with his pictures of barmaids and his pictures with Ann Coulter [sorry man, but she really does remind me of a humanoid giraffe!!] Whee! [And  of course    Jane  was there silly...]   Spent a good portion of the night talking to   Liz  about her awesome ink [better known for her work on the   NYC Bloggers Subway Map  or as   Crafty Bitch ] and   Leonard  about being an outspoken introvert. [It sounds weird, but trust me, it's possible.] He says nice things about us NYC bloggers in   his post  [considering he was skeptical about bloggers being normal poeple, :P ] AND he has pictures! LOL, the joys of having a digicam that works. Lucky bastard! I took the picture of him talking; he also was kinda enough to say nice things about me in his blog too, lol!...I also met the woman behind   Capital Influx , Elizabeth Spiers. She hopes that we all can try to get together monthly...It's a great idea, but it's hard getting everyone together being that we all have different schedules and whatnot. All I have to say is that I'm [impatiently] waiting for   Doc Weevil 's pix to be posted: he took a ton that were more candid shots. I know there's one that Doc took when I was talking to Clay about Ann Coulter and her neck -- I was gesturing while explaining that the neckline on the shirt Ann was wearing wasn't exactly flattering to her  right  when he took the picture so I'm either going to come out looking like I'm strangling myself or pulling down my own shirt. HAH! The amusement abounds.   After the bar we went to a pizza place right around the corner; luckily they were nice enough to accommodate 15 people with short notice. The name of the place was Big Nick's, so I had to take a picture of Nick with the menu...Heeheehee...Well, at least  I  found it amusing.   : )    My table consisted of Nick, Sasha, Doc, Leonard, and Allan [of   Rough Days for a Gentil Knight ]. Sasha suggessted getting a salami pizza; after a few minutes of confusion, we all agreed to try this being that she assured us that it was damn good...It may sound strange, but lemme tell you...DAMN!  Hella good pizza! While eating, the conversation covered a myriad of things and towards the end Doc told us some funny stories. Right as we were finishing, this weird old [I hope, drunken by the way he was acting] smelly guy with a harsh Russian [to my ears] accent decided to take an interest in my table since apparently, we were sitting at "his table". He wouldn't go away! He started bothering us about some book that he was writing and then decided to single out Ken for his strange ravings and rantings: "You are the cause of the downfall of the stock market!", "I want to have your children!", "You are the downfall of the economy!"  Weird things were spewing from this strange man's mouth. If only he knew that he would be infamous on the internet within a day...And had he gone further into his drunken rantings, there would have been 15 people pummeling him. Heh. I also met Jessica, the mind behind   Chlo and Pete . She's a really nice person although I wish I was able to talk to her more; I met her towards the end when we were all at the pizza place.  All in all a good night; had fun with the old friends, made some new ones and all is well...I hope to see them all next time too!     :D       ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~ ~~~      UPDATE [10:57 PM]:     YAY!
