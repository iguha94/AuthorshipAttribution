           Time off...    So far, my vacation has been fun. Saw Lilo & Stitch and alternately laughed and cried my way through through that movie. I don't normally cry at movies but at some parts it just hit a little too close to home. My rating? Damn good! Same rating for Windtalkers [if you can get over the whole MoviePhysics/Reality thing where one bullet kills 6 people and one side can't hit for shit unless it's an important character...You know, the  usual ...However I will say they broke the rules a few times; you  actually see  Nicolas Cage's character  reloading !!   Whoda thunk it?! Breakthrough directing, lemme tell ya. Heh.]  Still freaking out a bit because they only posted one grade so far; I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack soon if they don't post anything...BLAARGH!! But anyway, this whole "I don't have to commute! WHEE!" thing is getting out of hand. I can get used to this, heh!   Hrrrm...Gym is going great; got re-evaluated and am still waiting on the printout of my results; this will come on thursday and then I can update my progress chart. Excellence. What else? Ah yes, got a new radio for my car, complete with CD player so I've been driving around aimlessly just to listen to it. Still planning on a day to hit the beach  during the daytime      in order to work on tanning my skin. I'm disgustingly pale and it sickens me that Nick has surpassed me  yet again , another year in a row. I have to fix that. Somehow I'm gonna catch up. I don't know how, but I will.   ; )   Got a few more pictures, however these damn uncooperative people decided to mess up my shots by going to the beach when I wanted to take pictures. Bastards!  Grrr, that makes me angry. Oh well, it's summertime, I should have thought about that...annoyance...but still...just...GRRRRR!   Heh.  I think that's about it...I'll try to get a few fun links in here the rest of the day...   JOY!
