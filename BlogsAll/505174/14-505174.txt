         Yesterday I was checking all the different blogs I normally read when I came across   this post  by Kyle Still. I read it over [as well as   corresponding article ] and felt the need to go to   VodkaPundit  and read the   original post  and all the different   comments  that were left there...Almost everyone was in agreement; except for   one guy  whose thoughts went against the grain. I don't know what to think about that guy, but I'll give him credit for having the balls to voice his opinion. A few other people ranted about what went down but they didn't hit me as hard; the exception being my   Nick  who also wrote down his own views on the   matter  [and as usual, got   straight to the point ]...I love him for that...  The sun is shining warmly again today and I want to go outside and enjoy it. After everything that has happened, I just want to tune out the world and live a little...  ....And since I didn't make it clear yesterday, [sorry Emily] it's the   tourists for whom the importance of the WTC just doesn't register   that severely piss me off;   the ones who can't seem to grasp   that NO, this IS NOT Disneyland and you should not be happily frolicking about and taking pictures. I  sure as hell can understand  the rest of the people [who like me] wanted to go down and see it, to pay our respects to those we knew [and didn't know] who lost their lives there.   Sorry about that.
