           Feelin' the Blogospheric love...    Dave from   Wake Me Up On Judgement Day  has decided to   send some linkage love my way  because of some of the things I have written...Well, kindasorta... ; )  But also because of my picture in the top left hand corner of my blog. Yeap Dave, those are  my  lips. :)  He's also being really nice and repeating my call for help on my permalinks issue...So when you're done here, why don't you stop by his blog and say hello? His blog has been hanging out in my "Neat-o outspoken political critics" links section for awhile now, but if you're a lazy bum and want instant gratification, you can click   here .   Also, Jimmy Olsen of   The Ends of the Earth  wrote me an email saying hello and other nice things...His blog always makes me laugh...So let me just say, "Heya Jim!" and if point you in his blog's direction too...Again, if you're too lazy to even  look  at my linklist [although you  should  because there are a myriad of other nice blogs there! :P ] or even too lazy to move your mouse up a teeny bit to click on his blog's name you can click   here .  Bum.  ; )   One more person I have to say hello to is Jade from   Reflective Lens . Thanks for trying to help with my permalinks issue...I guess I'm just blind to what the problem is because I'm getting so fed up with it. :(    More instant gratification is found   here .
