           ...And now, something completely different.    YAY!     Nick  finally updated his blog.   :D   Also,   WishWatch  is BACK with a vengeance! Whee!   Clay  has comments on his blog now...Excellent! [And yes, more Drunk Clay pictures are needed!]    ;)     Orchid  has some funny links up... Talking about funny shit,   Lane 's got pictures of the new world leader... And of course,   Jim  always puts a smile on my face.   :)   You should all go visit   The Society  right this second. As far as I know,   Leonard  is the only blogger out there who discusses anarchy, so go read his thoughts on it. I  still  have  no idea  how   The Shmuck  and   Alan  found me, but either way, their respective blogs are good; the former deals with politics and the latter deals with tech stuff. I happen to like   Sarge 's pictures. [I feel weird using his real name so Sarge he stays.]   :)     Katrina warns  about WinAmp3. Tanks! Good luck   Blue Hill !   WAAH!   S.G.  has gone over to the Dark Side. :( Those on short breaks are missed:   Doc ,   Kyle ,   Zilber  and   Mindles .  Yet all of their reasons are understandable.
