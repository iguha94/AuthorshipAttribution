         A recent posting to my PCOS board...   Just feel the need to take a load off...I've really been bumming it the past few weeks.  I have been trying to get myself out of it...but it's not working very well (lol).  I'm so tired of constantly fighting...I'm still fighting to get an appointment with the endicrinologist.  This past week they came up with a new excuse...it's a doozy.  The dr's partners are leaving, so he must now go through all of THOSE files to see who he will be taking on...so no appointment for me and no promise of a date either!  Ugh...frustration.  My hubby gets aggravated because I don't throw a bigger fit about it...he doesn't get that I can't handle the stress that would involve...it is just easier to pretend it isn't happening and plug along.  Then...I decide to call for my yearly.  They want a nurse to see me instead of my gyn.  I told the woman I really need to see the gyn as I haven't had a period in a few months and am starting to be concerned.  She told me no appointments available through September and she can't schedule into October yet...ugh!  And the worst, I finally took the pregnancy test...I didn't want to continue taking the meds if I was preggo...and, surprise, I'm not.  Rationally, I knew I wouldn't be...but why do I give myself the glimmer of hope?  I knew it would be negative...yet I allowed myself to hope it would be positive...  Anyway...sorry for the rant.  I hope you all are well and happy...
