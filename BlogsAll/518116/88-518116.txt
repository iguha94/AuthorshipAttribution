         I'm so bored...I hate being bored...but at least I'm getting paid to be bored...right???  I don't know...BUT since I have nothing better to do and I've visited most of my regular online haunts, I decided to start reading the "most recently updated" blogs...some of that is SCARY but some of it is really cool!  The funny thing is, I hate responding to people's blogs...I feel like I'm infringing, even though I have been wanting to get comments up so I can know if someone is reading mine.  Psycho.  But someone had a halarious posting about people who talk during movies/tv...that is SO me!  Hubby and I fight all the time about this because he will ask me what just happened, then again, and again because he keeps asking me to explain, therefore missing even more...just SHUT UP until commercial!  Plus, keep in mind that because I think I'm going deaf I am usually watching (movies) with the subtitles at the bottom...I can't read the subtitles and explain to you at the same time!!!  Anyway, I responded and told her I was so with her...  Blogger...why can't I ever be on "most recently updated" blog list?  I think this is soon going to become an obsession of mine...I like to see my name in lights, I must admit...ohhh, I'm mad now...I forgot to tell Lis how dorky her older sis really is!  See, I am a rw/rr junky...and I had to report an Abe sighting to my rr/rw site...http://www.therealworldroad.cjb.net/  Well, they thanked me on their website but now I can't get past their most recent bloggings to find what the date was.  It must have been sometime this month, last month at the latest.  If you find out the date, let me know...  So, I mentioned Britney to K.  She laughed and told me she would check her calendar.  Which basically means, do I have to?  I'm not letting her off that easy!  I'll bring it up to her later this week and see what she says...I just want to get rid of my ticket!
