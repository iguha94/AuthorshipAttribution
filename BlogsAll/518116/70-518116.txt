         Okay...so, I had to do one of those jr high things with your answers in it the other day...I was going to cheat and use that as a blog, but I forgot to copy it!  Plus, the opening paragraph was a tad hostile...calling people lame if they didn't do it correctly...whatever...so, of course, everyone did it the "right way" and I never got my answers back!  UGH!  People have to do a lot more than that to be lame in my book...plus, I was funny, so I can't "recreate" it...too bad.  Another cool story about my roommate...she met the Bachelor Andrew you know, the one that chose the cute girl Jen...she and our college buddy stood in line for four hours to meet him...and I guess Jen is even cuter and more petite in person!  Plus, I guess Kelly Jo from KALAMAZOO is hanging out with her mom in Wheaton right now...I know my sis was wondering where she was hiding out at...there you go!  And now, to let you know why I am about to be murdered...I have an obsession...eBay.  EVIL!  I can't stop!  First, I wanted to add a layer to my living room...so I decided to go with a collection I've been wanting to start but know my hubby will not like once he is on to me...kissing.  HA!  So, I am scooping up these figurines and such of people kissing...it is so cute!  Well...then, I was looking under "kissing" on Ebay when I came across the most adorable animation... PUCCA!  She is a Korean cartoon and is ADORABLE!  So, I just won a bag of her and am hoping to have the faceplate in a day...I'm in deep shit.  But I can't help it...you go find her and tell me if she isn't the cutest thing!
