         Okay..I forgot to copy and of course I timed out...so here's the recap!  It's been a while since I have been able to blog...we had the big move that took four days instead of the anticipated 2...and of course, there was the pre-move preparation--packing--YUCK!  But of course, my husband, who is oh so understanding, helped me with the packing...oh, wait, not MY husband...he would just keep looking around and say, what is it that needs to be packed...uh, HELLO!!! see this *@#! all over...all THAT needs to be packed...he just doesn't get it and continues to choose to be ignorant...and it is getting VERY old!  Which leads to his next blunder...remember the bday that was coming up that I was dreading so...thinking I had made this clear to him, made me believe that he wouldn't have the AUDACITY to forget...well, that part was true...however, he didn't make time to get me anything...yes, I know, you are thinking, what a jerk...but, please, don't be so kind!  Ass...big, fat, hairy, horse's ass, would be the correct way of stating it!  He said that he didn't have time...because, oh yeah i forgot, he worked SOOO hard on packing...whatever!!!  So, basically, not a whole lot of people remembered....our parents remembered...my older sister called and sang with the bro in law, but then said she forgot to mail my present...my other sister called the cell, but I didn't get it until this weekend...other sister is still mia...my best friend called that day, but forgot to say happy birthday!!!...my gram called to say she forgot to mail the card...the other grandparents I still haven't heard from...  Exactly why i HATE my birthday...
