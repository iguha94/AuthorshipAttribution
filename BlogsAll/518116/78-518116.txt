Time you finished this e-mail: 8:43am...I'm slow!  Return Directions: Now, here's what you're supposed to do... Copy (not forward) this entire email and paste it into a new email that you will send. Change all of the answers so that they apply to you.   Then send this to a whole bunch of people you know INCLUDING the person who sent it to you. The theory is that you will learn a lot of little known facts about those who know you. Remember to send it back to the person who sent it to you.    Okay...now the funny part...I'll see if any of my friends notice...I accidentally put on the "name on birth certificate" my married name!  Whoops!!!  BTW...sister is not longer MIA...she actually called shortly after I posted the last one...lol.
