         ahhh...Mondays truly suck dookie.  I hate coming back to work...I must say the past month or so, I have had no motivation to work...fire me...please!  I have gotten to a point where I am tired of dealing with all the bullshit...either I have a job, or I don't...just let me know and put me out of my misery...latest rumor?  We'll get word this week that we are all done and have two weeks to clear out...or that we will all be put through one company and our paychecks will get axed.  Now, I'm not that stingy, but...cutting my paycheck would be like bleeding a dead horse, you won't get much!  Can you leave my measly pittance alone?!  Okay...so I am sure some previously departed colleagues may gladly take my check...but I'm thinking, if they cut my pay, I would prefer to get laid off and get unemployment for doing nothing rather than actually working the 40 hours and getting the same amount...ya know?  So...my frugal side has taken over...I'm all eBay'd out for the time...it was pretty funny to watch S bite his tongue when THREE boxes were delivered on Saturday...man, i wish the postman would not ring the doorbell...of course, I was on the phone with my mil so I couldn't run and grab them...oh, well...he seemed to buy the "I'll have the $ when the bill comes" theory...and it was also pretty funny to see his reaction as he is looking at all the knick-knacks in the living room...HA!  I made him put up a shelf in there so I could put pics back out...he just rolled his eyes...but I have to admit they are cute...now if my Pucca stuff could just arrive!
