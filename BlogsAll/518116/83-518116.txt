          Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way....   it's Christmas time!!!  I'm so excited...well kind of...hubby does not have Christmas eve or Christmas off...BUT I get the 24th through 26th off, yippee!!!  Then, the following week, I have the 1st and 2nd off!!!  Plus, I have a couple half days in there because the sitter isn't working...woohoo!  I have just about all of my shopping done...just a few last minute details, which of course, include hubby.  He finally sat down last night to do a list for me, but it is all out of catalogs!!!  I told him I didn't know if that would work since it is so close, but we'll see...  Still no word from Sam...it is kind of funny actually...do I think she got the hint?  Maybe...I'm the queen of no confrontation...so I'm hoping I don't have to spell out the fact that I don't see how she can consider herself a friend, let a lone a best friend considering she STEALS and LIES...ugh.  This so takes me back to high school...it is annoying...  Speaking of which...B and I went to H's house this Sunday...this girl is nuts!  Her ex is getting married this coming year, so of course she is trying to get married BEFORE him...psycho.  To top it off, she is telling me all this drama she has in her life...like it is perfectly normal for an almost 30 year old to have so much drama, like she is back in jr high...she kept saying "now it isn't any of my business, but I said..."  Hello?!  Did you hear what you just said???  It ISN'T any of your business, so stop getting in the middle of every blessed thing...it is so strange that adults still feed off of drama...maybe it was the amount of drama I had in my "younger" days (ha!)...I had more than my share and now, I just try to stay out of everything...if someone asks my opinion, well, of course, I have one and I will give it to you, but I try to bite my tongue until someone asks...  anyway...better get back to work...not really...a friend called...lol!
