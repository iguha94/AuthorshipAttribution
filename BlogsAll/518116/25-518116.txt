         cool...my bf called last night and it was actually a NORMAL conversation...we goofed around, gossiped about the people we knew, you know, bf crap...near the end he got very preachy, but it was more understood from the other things he had told me.  it was good to know that our friendship hadn't become all weirded out...  he is coming to visit! of course, he is arriving the week that I am going to visit my sis in Martha's vineyard and my other sis in NY...but he will be here for a partial week once I get back.  He wanted hubby and I to go to Cedar point with some others...but a) hubby will be out of town, b) b and I will just be getting back, and c) some others are ones that i can't stand for 2 hours...let alone, in a car, for HOURS and standing in line together for HOURS!  He thought it would be all cool because that is what we did on our senior skip day in which only he and I skipped!  yEAH, that would be cool from that standpoint but too many other eghs.  now, my other bf is upset because i told her i might not be able to come this year to TX...Pharmacia was taken over by Phizer so I don't know if I will have a job by the end of the year...also, with this NY trip, it is costing what I would have spent on TX.  I just don't know if we would feel comfortable spending that money so closely together...I used the cop out "don't know if I'll have a job"...but I don't think she's buying it...I told her I would keep my eye out for a cheap ticket but I can't promise anything.  that's all for now...I have to go work:)
