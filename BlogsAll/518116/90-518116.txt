         HA!  I love it when can actually get some stuff to work!  Of course, it isn't really my mind figuring stuff out, just my fingers typing in the right questions and finding it...I FINALLY have comments...I have been blogging for 2+ years and JUST found it!  Yippee!  So, leave a comment...or two!  Hubby thought he was in hell this weekend...I made him help me clean out all the closets.  It feels like a huge burden has been lifted off my shoulders because they are all (okay, one is left) organized.  I know, I need help.  I don't quite know why I have this insane need for complete organization in hidden places...most people think if there is a door to close on it, who cares?  Not me...it is like this unrelenting thought that I have constantly telling me that my closets are in disarray...no more!  Well, it will last at least a month...  Other than that...it was 70 outside yesterday!  Unbelievable...so B and I went outside for a few hours.  I got to clean out the gardens and revel in the fact that the plants survived and are starting to come out.  Friday B and I went outside and had a mini celebration over our first flower of the season, a crocus.  It was so small but so proud, the overachiever of the bunch.  Of course, I got B to get ecstatic with me...hubby thinks I am nuts and passing it down to B...ha!  Purplepanda is gone...it is so weird, we are so off and on with contact...but of all my sisters, she is the one most like me...I miss her, just knowing she isn't 20minutes away...but, alas, she will be traveling the country getting paid for it!  I envy her and I hope she is able to enjoy it...she deserves to have a fulfilling life and I hope this gives her it...
