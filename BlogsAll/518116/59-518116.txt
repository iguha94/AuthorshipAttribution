         whoops!  I guess it has been a little while...I have been expending all of my energy telling half-truths to half the people in my life... My friend is moving so we are having a black sheep party on friday.  She and I thought it would be halarious to have a sex toy party...the other two did not want to, so we are keeping this a secret from them...lie 1.  Then, my hubby wasn't real thrilled so I waited to tell him...lie 2.  I am having hats made up for us...lie 3.  I am in charge of getting her cake at work and getting her to the conference room...lie 3.  The issue is, I talk to all these people constantly throughout the day...do you know how hard it is to remember who knows how much?!  I'm getting my nose pierced on Friday...lie 4.  Then, this girl's neighbor calls and says she has a surprise block party planned on Friday.  She basically wants me to cancel our plans so hers can go through...ummm, no.  So I couldn't handle the stress anymore and just told my friend...she laughed at what a dumbass her neighbor is for planning a surprise going away party...did she not realize she would be making plans and have lots of things to accomplish?!  Now, the other two are dueling what we are going to be doing...I want to go to the piano bar...no I want to go dancing...well if we go there, I'm not going...can anyone say jr high?  So, to keep the peace (and knowing if they are acting like this they are REALLY going to be pissed about the sex toy party!!!) I offered to give up the tattoo/piercing parlor...no one will hear of it.  Shit.  I'm starting to freak out...do I really want a nose ring...how bad will this thing hurt?  you know, normal piercing reservations...oh yeah, will hubby kick me out?  Anyway...watch out KZOO...the sheep are on the loose!
