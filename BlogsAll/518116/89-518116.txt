         I'm so glad that worked!  Anyway...so sis can't make it to the Britney Spears concert...my other friend who is going with us had bugged and begged for her ticket, so when Lis couldn't make it, I told her she could buy it...well, now she is backtracking and saying she "doesn't know" if she wants it or not...ummm, the concert is in two weeks!  I think I'm just being bitchy but I kinda need to know so I can figure out who else to sell it to!  Thing is, until I have it unloaded on someone else, I am going to sit here and worry about it...I'm so weird when it comes to this kind of stuff...ocd.  So, I called her today to "talk" hoping she would mention if she wanted it or not...she didn't.  Well, i'm going out to lunch with a potential buyer, so I am just going to ask her if she wants to go with me...if she does, awesome!  If not, keeping my fingers crossed Red will...but if she wants to go and Red decides she wants the ticket...fuck me...but I'm not going to get screwed with an extra ticket because she can't make up her mind...see???  Obsessive...I'm trying to rationalize and figure this all out and it is driving me nuts!  The bigger question is...why does a 27year old feel the need to go to this concert anyways?  LOL...
