         lol...really hard!!!  Okay...I was wrong, he did call back, but since I leave early on Wednesdays, I missed his call again...so I called him and lm, and he called back...what do you say to a person you don't really know anymore and don't really care if you talk to?!  We talked for 20minutes about nothing...I have nothing to say!  What do I say...um, I was really screwed up and needed some closure so I could finally stop thinking about you...well, I got it and now I wish you would stop calling me?!  I don't know if I can tell him that.  And not because I want to stay in contact, but because I don't want to hurt his feelings AND I don't want to promote any psychoticness...he is all about that he has changed, and part of me wants to believe that, but the other part sure doesn't want to pay the penalty if I'm wrong!   Anyway...he went into how he kicked his girlfriend out of his apartment a few weeks ago...hmmm...no straight invitations, but it seemed like he was fishing!  No, no, no, and NO!!!  Wouldn't have done that when I was insane, definitely not now either!  He finally let me get off the phone, and said...I'll call you soon...and then said, wait maybe you should call me...I just said I'll talk to you later...  Can you tell I have absolutely nothing to do at work???  Ugh...it gets so boring to sit here for 9 hours and dink around.  There are only so many things I can look up on the internet!  Hey...I just got a work-related email...yeah--something to do!
