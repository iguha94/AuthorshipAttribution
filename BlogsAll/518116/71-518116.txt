         Hey! did you know Matrix will be out in about 2 weeks!  I hope they show his naked ass again...yummy!  Halarious, yet true story...my roomie's hubby has put a personal ad in the yahoo pages...I died of laughter when she told me and it was much better when I saw it for myself!  What a freak!!!  He put this picture of himself in a lake...perhaps to hide the "few extra pounds" as he describes it.  I asked her if the fact he lives in his parents basement is a selling point!  Don't think he isn't creative...nope, he took his position as a manager of aquatics at the Y and twisted that to mean Executive Director or some sort of bullshit...hysterical!  And, no, he doesn't sugar coat the fact he had a wife and child yet got another woman pregnant...he admits it...yet another winning facet.  So, my roomie finally admitted she is dating one of our college friends.  She had casually mentioned him when she was here and I asked her about him...she thought I was psychic...lol.  I just told her I was good at reading into people and the fact she had mentioned him told me there was something to that...so, she is secretly dating him, it is complicated.  But he is a sweetie and I'm hoping it works out for her...she deserves a break!  The twitch is gone...for now!  I can't tell you how awesome it is not to have it twitching!  That's all I have time for now...
