         The comments didn't work...oh well...  Awesome weekend...I went to see my roommate in Chi-town...she shipped off her hubby and bubs so we had the night to ourselves...IKEA here we come!!! We tried to remember that our husbands would kill us if we brought home one of everything:)  We had a rip-roaring time at Houlihan's and then went to find the nearest tattoo parlor...the funny thing was, there was some SHADY business next door...hmm....not drawing any conclusions but what do you think with lots of doors and an ATM??? Of course, I had to use the bathroom as soon as we get there...the place smelled HIDEOUS!!! But, using their restroom was worse then squatting against a tree in the African Rainforest...I felt seriously violated and thank god I had spare kleenex--hello, toilet paper!  It was just like old times...we even watched our party videos...boy, were we off the hook back then!!! A little embarassing but mostly just HALARIOUS!  It was great re-visiting Tow-truck Mike, Joe, John...George--I mean Kevin...sigma-kappa...and Kelly...  Hubby was a downer when I got home...he was CRABBY...so we had a huge blowout...ah, wonderful way to cap off the weekend!  I talked to Mr X again Sunday night...it was funny calling because I had wanted to suggest we see each other at some point but didn't have the balls.  So I was just like "um, yeah, hi, uh-hu"--DORK!!!  I think it made him crack up though:)  Just talked about what's new and then got into a deep discussion on happiness and to what extent someone is free to chase it down...but his phone kept cutting out and I was sick of calling back...so I didn't.  But I KNOW he has my phone number...he said he had lost it before--uh-huh, sure--so I gave it to him AGAIN...let's see if he ever actually calls...still holding out for my bd.
