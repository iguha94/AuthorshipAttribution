         wow...I really love calling in sick.  Hence, why I believe that I would be okay to not work...  Yesterday, we had to get the furnace maintenanced.  So, I decided the remote chance that the guy would have to come between the time hubby was gone and we weren't back from preschool yet, I should just take the day off!  Because of the time change, B slept until 10am...wow, that felt nice!  I decided to start painting the basement floor...hubby and I ate lunch, picked up B from preschool, took a nap, planted some flowers, tried out my rice cooker, read...what a productful day!  My heart is so not into work anymore...all I can think about is figuring out a cool job to have!  Hubby is talking about going to state trooper school...how cool is that?!  I am excited for him and am hoping to do the appropriate amount of nagging/encouraging to get him to apply.  One hurdle at a time...he is concerned about quitting work and not making it through.  I suggested that first he needs to apply and be accepted...he needs to get into shape so he can pass the physical test...then we can discuss the possibilities.  I have a big beef with a company that would not support a colleague to further advance.  In my mind, I would find it an honor to have someone advance to state trooper...a selling point.  Ahhh, but that is rational thought...not hubby's department!  Quite frankly, I would be okay if they won't let him take his legally approved personal leave, him turning in resignation.  Then, if he doesn't make it, he will be forced to find a different job.  Scary, yes...potentially financially straining, yes!  But worth it in the long run, hell yes!  I just want him to be happy and I know this is a dream of his...enter the nagging/encouraging...
