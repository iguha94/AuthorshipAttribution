         oh boy...can souls haunt you even if they are still trapped in a live body?  And by saying this body is live, I'm making an assumption because I would  assume  that if this body was no longer alive, I would have heard about it...  It is so very strange...hubby and I are really doing well...obviously, we have a few spats here and there but nothing out of the ordinary...it is like we have finally gotten to the place where we can understand and appreciate each other.  It used to be where we would try to point out what we were doing for the other, now we both can see it, openly recognize it, and bestow gratitude for the actions the other is doing.  I finally feel like my best friend is back...  enter weird dreams...I have been dreaming about Mr X...not ocassionally (is that spelled right?!) but almost every night.  It is really kind of disturbing.  Sometimes it is me running away from him and sometimes it is him running away from me.  Either way, in the middle of a dream we sit down together and talk about how much we still love each other but that it isn't the right time or that it will never be.  So what the fuck is that supposed to mean?  I mean, I haven't talked, seen, or thought much about this guy for quite some time...and now this?  I don't know, it just seems to prove how messed up in the head I am, unless, which I'm hoping is the case, a living soul can haunt you...
