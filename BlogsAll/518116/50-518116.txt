         I finally got to watch BOTs reunion...what a disappointment.  As everyone had reviewed on their site...nothing exciting.  How much more interesting if Emily had come and been her "Emily" self...oh well...  Bachelor finale...how predictable.  At least I can say I give him credit for choosing brains and beauty over just beauty.  Kirsten should grow up and realize, if you are so busy pointing out everyone else's faults, you make people wonder what  you are trying to divert attention from (Like the fact you have a boyfriend waiting for you at home!!!!)  Man...I am so glad I did not waste my time on Mr Personality...now, I understand that I just saw 10 minutes of it...but was that girl a total bimbo???  She seemed like such a flake...I was watching the unmasking (everyone: ahhhhh) hoping a total dog-face would be chosen...is this "reality" show real???  She chose a gorgeous guy who just happens to be a millionaire...hmmm, how coincidental!  American Idol: Sorry guys, I don't do the reminiscing...I'll wait til Wednesday to find out who wins...Reuben?  I hope so...  Not much else is new...went to the Dr.  I have carpal tunnel and possibly arthritis.  My parents both flipped about that...it doesn't run in our family so they are convinced I can't have it.  Well, I don't particularly care what it is at this point, just that someone figures it out and gets me better!  Four more days until Riverdance...two more weeks until anniversary...  I almost forgot!!!  SERIES Finale of Buffy...choose Spike, choose Spike, choose Spike!!!
