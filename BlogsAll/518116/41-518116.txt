         okay...so yes, I still am slightly weirded...and, as any good psychology major would, I have tried to psychoanalyze myself and come up with the following (please realize feelings have absolutely nothing to do with what is reality):  I was nuts because mr x was my back-up plan...yes, yes, very sad to admit...but in my head (not the rational part I might add) he was who would be there when no one else would be...being someone with low self-esteem/self-worth and having had many many many people walk right out of my life, here was a guy who thought I was god's gift to human kind.  Yes, I do realize he was also psychotic, but that really has nothing to do with my point.  So, when I find out he has now replaced that sound philosophy with someone else, it was disturbing...what about our hypothetical children???  What about our rendezvous in 10 more years???  Yes, I know this was never going to happen, but what if???  Now, I have no one as back-up...which, realistically, is good.  Still a little weirded out...tempted to call and say "congrats"...weirded out by the possibility there will be children not involving me...but overall, happy...why?  Because in the real world he was a crazy m'er f'er and this means he won't be darkening my doorstep...no, that is just a defense mechanism...glad because it sounds as though he has moved on and has, hopefully, found someone that will make him happy and is right for him...just like I found the one that is right for me...
