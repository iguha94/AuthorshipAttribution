         ahhh...back to the life of honesty.  I was really starting to sweat all these lies I had to tell people.  But, it was worth it...one of the black sheep ditched us, so then there were three...and only one didn't know about the sex toy party.  So, first, one of my other friends showed up...we started talking and she was like "Who is that?" oh, that's my friend so and so... "Okaaaay"...no clue about what was about to happen.  Then SHE shows up...so black sheep is like "Who is that?"  Oh, that's Brenda... "How many people are coming?  I guess I didn't realize friends...(her eyes see the "Love Swing" Brenda is carrying) OH MY GOD!  I almost felt sorry for her...she broke out into hives...halarious!  She stayed for most of it...pay backs are hell, I'm not scared!  Found out JP and hubby are separated...hmmm...I could be mean, but I'll refrain...  I got my nose done!  I can't believe it, I got so nervous!  I tried to call hubby half a dozen times to see how pissed he would be if I had it done...but I couldn't get ahold of him...so I did it anyway...I'm thinking it's cute but it takes getting used to!  And, I constantly forget it is there, so I go to itch my nose and grab it...ouch!  Other than that though, it really doesn't hurt...and surprisingly it did hurt less than my belly button!
