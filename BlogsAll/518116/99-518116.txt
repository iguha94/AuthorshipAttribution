         I am haunted...the strange part is, as far as I know, the soul that haunts me is still alive.  Does he realize he haunts me?  Is he aware of his starring role in my dreams?  Does he wake up and wish he was back asleep to spend another fleeting moment together?  I don't understand it and perhaps I never will...is this the evidence I wanted for years?  Did I excommunicate my soul mate?  I always questioned why we were so volatile yet I could never get enough.  Such extreme highs and lows, emotions I have never felt again since my departure.    Lord help me.  I love my husband.  He is the best friend I have...I would do anything for him.  I have tried to cut out this piece of my heart because I know if he had any sense of this he would be crushed...but can I control my dreams?  I sit here and think and rationalize about it all...I have been with my husband longer than I was with him...it has been so long, he surely is not the same person, I know I am not the same...it is a dream, only a dream...but why does it keep playing?  In the waking hours, I have made my choice, I am happy with my choice, I would never change my choice if it was ever an option...it is just the night that needs convincing...
