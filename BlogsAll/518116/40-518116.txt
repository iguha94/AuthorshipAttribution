         Ahhh...isn't it lovely to be working on a beautiful Sunday afternoon???  I can hardly take it anymore!!!  I am trying to make up some hours that I will miss...even though hubby said it wasn't necessary...I feel guilty, so here I am!  All that is getting me through is knowing in only 2 1/2 more days I will be on a flight to Vegas...yeah, baby!  I can hardly wait!  I will be driving to meet my flight in O'hare and stop to shop along the way:)  I am bummed only by the fact that due to my rental car, I will not be able to visit IKEA...and I will be arriving to early on Monday to stop...bummer!  But, I will just use it as an excuse to go later:)  Vegas...here I come!  All day THursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday...four whole days of glorious freedom!!!  I pray that bf and I get along the whole time...right now it seems as though our eating habits will be what makes the difference...she sounds like she wants to eat the entire time...I gracefully tried to tell her that I can't do that unless I am tied to the crapper all day, lovely, eh???  Especially now that the curse has come to visit.  I am praying very HARD that it disappears by Wednesday, it could happen!  Not sure what we will do, Celine is not looking real...no response from the damn dj yet...I'll email Sabrina again tomorrow...maybe she can bug her again...she really thought they would be pulling through.  I told bf if we hit big while we are there, I would be willing to go...otherwise, I am not paying $150+ for anyone!!!  I am hoping two things...one, that I have a relaxing, stress-free time...and two, that I hit big enough to pay off a major bill...other than that, no agenda but fun!  Now, mind you, to succeed on number two, it must happen on the $50 limit I have placed on gambling...so, basically, if I succeed with number one, I will be happy!
