         Sorry I didn't have time to actually write something of substance yesterday...however, I thought I should spend a little time working since that is what they pay me for... although, today, I get to be here for longer...so I can goof for longer!!!  Okay...what has been making my brain do crunches...I talked to Mr X about three-four weeks ago...for a LONG time.  It was very nice actually...however, since then, I have an undying urge to call him again.  I did call back once to let him know the (fake) reason for my original call was now void due to an unforeseen (also, fake!) emergency...ah, revisiting the jr high days can be so freeing!... alas, X was not home and I was only able to communicate with the answering machine.  I was hoping I would receive a return call just to say--hey, I really enjoyed talking with you...I've missed you and I wish you well...  Now, I am holding onto the hope that I will receive a message for the dreaded "B" that is rapidly approaching...  Time to psychoanalyze....I have come to the conclusion that I am mortified of commitment...rather humorous looking the commitment level in my life I know...  But I have a tendency to get myself WAY over my head (with commitments) and then start pushing them all away...so, is this another passive aggressive way to kill-off my current commitments?  I mean, come on!!! I used to think the separation from Mr X was the one SANE thing I did in my life...and now, I keep wondering how to wiggle back into his...
