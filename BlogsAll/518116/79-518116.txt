         ahhh...what a lovely weekend.  Halloween was nothing special.  B was Woody and we dressed Spike up as Buzz Lightyear...it was pretty funny.  Spike did not like the costume and came and hid his head in my arm, too cute!    We watched my parents dog...he pooped and pee'd throughout the main floor, I was ready to kill him by the time it was time to send him home...  My in laws came...boy was my mil in an exceptionally bitchy mood.  Oh, this was funny too...they are all telling me (Hubby's aunt, uncle, and grandma also came) how his sil has all these cravings and is oh so moody because of the pregnancy...ummm, hello?! She is only seven weeks along...HA!  Most people do not even KNOW they are pregnant at that time...except for those who are majorly trying...she also has gained four pounds.  Boy, I sure hope she continues to pack them on...to that, I would say KARMA.  But, anyways, I was so trying to keep my mouth shut, but I must have gotten a look.  My fil says, I keep trying to tell them this is all in their head, that it is too soon.  I just said, EXACTLY!  I can't wait to see if they come to B's party and if she is bitching about being pregnant then...ugh.  annoying...  anyway...my sis has gone mia again...oh, where are you?  I need to know about your couch so we can get it out of the garage and park inside again...BEFORE the snow!
