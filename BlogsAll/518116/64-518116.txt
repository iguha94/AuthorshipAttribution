         Okay...I have like five minutes before a staff meeting...but I have to piggy back off the last entry.  Newlyweds...last night...they are at a restaurant with Nick's brother and his wife.  They ask Jessica if she would like any of the buffalo wings that they are all eating.  She says, "No, I don't eat buffalo"...her sil says, "what?" Jessica says "I don't like buffalo"  Of course, they all CRACK up!  SIL "They aren't actually made out of buffalo, they're chicken" Of course, Jessica is royally confused so Nick's brother is trying to explain...finally he says, "didn't you ever wonder how they were buffalo wings but buffalos don't actually have wings?!" She says, "I guess I never thought about that"...halarious stuff! I am hoping she is cool and can watch this stuff and laugh hysterically at herself...otherwise, she is probably humiliated...I say, hey, we are all freaks, you are just getting paid bucco bucks to air yours on national television!  Anyway...not much else is new.  Work is super frustrating, our computer systems are supposed to be merging but no one can make up their minds to press the on switch...meanwhile, the rest of us are going nuts trying to get everything straightened out...  I get to refinish our stairwell this weekend...whohoo!  Hubby and b are going to his parents to help chop wood for grandma.  So, it will give me the time alone I need to do this project...and a weekend alone!
