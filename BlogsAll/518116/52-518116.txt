         well...I've been avoiding.  Not been a good week.  Hubby and I have been going toe to toe...is it coincidence that I have been feeling like shit?  I get tired of whine, whine, whine...so I decided to stay away from the blogger until the whine has left the building.  Anyway...today was actually a good morning...after yesterday, I thought I was going to have to commit myself.  I had been up until 3:30am in hideous pain...ready to cut off what was the root, but I couldn't find the root.  Anyway, this morning I woke up at 5am feeling great...except I had a kink in my back.  I tried to go back to sleep but the kink hurt, so, I listened to my body and got my butt out of bed to work out.  Wow...it is so lame-o, but I really feel great now.  I haven't been able to work out since Vegas...months ago!  So, to feel good, and have the desire on the same day was a mini miracle.  So, I did the A workout on my new Cindy tape and the first set of abs and arms/chest on the original Cindy video.  I didn't want to push too much, knowing I have to survive a day at work and this evening.  But, I did 25 minutes...yippee!  Just a side note...watch Paradise Hotel?  I didn't...but I was flipping through and saw this girl that I "recognized"...so I watched until I could place her...she was one of the girls from Temptation Island!!! Whatever!
