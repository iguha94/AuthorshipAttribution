         Not much new...surprise, surprise, the specialist does want to see me...but doesn't have an appointment until January!  I guess I will take that as a good sign...nothing life threatening?!  I must address a show...NEWLYWEDS.  Can you say frickin' halarious?  Ummm...Jessica thought chicken of the sea tuna might mean it is actually chicken, not tuna.  She makes a mess, which she is utterly clueless how to clean up, while she is making her half ass attempt, she asks Nick is she is doing a good job...then asks if they have a mop.  Nick looks at her like she is nuts and says "How can you ask me if you are doing a good job but you don't know if we own a mop?"  This girl has obviously been extremely catered to..its kind of sad because she has no idea how to take care of herself, let alone her house and husband.  Makes you wonder what she will do when her parents keel over...but, on a non-deep level, it makes me laugh so hard!  I don't know if anyone else is watching it...I looked it up on MTV and it was a little buried in their site, but, I hope people are...it is so funny!  Kind of like what the first season of the Osbourne's was...  Other than that...my bf stole my sweats and shirt she borrowed when she was at my house...I should have known better than to give her name brand shit.  My CK sweats and a JCrew shirt...I'm trying not to be pissed, which would be a lot easier if she wasn't denying that she had them!  She says she left them in my closet, well, I scoured that puppy and was not shocked not to find them...ugh!  I keep trying to tell myself they are just clothes, they don't mean anything, but at the same time, do I need to lock everything up when she comes over?!  I think I'm a little ocd...let this serve as an example.
