         wow...just when I was getting bummed out this week...i heard from my bf...(see 4/4/02 log).  wow, even though it was only two sentences, it made my day.  he is going to try to call tonight so that will probably make my week.  I have really missed talking to him, though i am very worried about the whole mr x thing...i don't know yet if i will tell him because he will be far from thrilled...he'll probably be mad, so i'll wait to see what is going on in his life to see if it is even important enough to discuss.  it's kinda funny how most of my friends are guys...i always thought that it was because i couldn't make girlfriends but guys are a lot less maintenance, plus they don't usually act catty like girls do.  i just don't think that i like to disclose much to others, so i think i only let in a few at a time.  the only problem with that is that when one relationship is on the rocks it knocks out about half of my support system...  okay...so a new admin started yesterday and i had the opportunity to help train.  she was asking me about different people (admins) and i went into this whole spiel about how i don't like to get caught up in the politics of offices...blah, blah, bla...so she says "i'm the same way!" and then rants for 10-15 min about who she does and doesn't like...how do you know after 1 day?!  ugh, admins are an incorrigible bunch of weirdos!    got some cute lingerie for the get-away...now i'm debating a bikini wax...ouch!  but it beats shaving...i wonder if a home waxing system would work.  i also picked up some comfy pj's and am considering any other fun gadgets...hmmm...not quite decided.  since the hubby isn't too into funky i figured the lingerie will be enough for him:)  that's all for now...toodles!
