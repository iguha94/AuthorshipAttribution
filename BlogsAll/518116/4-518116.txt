         Okay...a guy I used to work with sent me this...I thought it was pretty cool--thanks, Dirk!   BITCHDOM   When I stand up for myself and my beliefs, they call me a bitch.  When I stand up for those I love, they call me a bitch.  When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts or do things my own way,    they call me a bitch.   Being a bitch means I won't compromise what's in my heart.  It means I live my life MY way.  It means I won't allow anyone to step on me.  When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak against it, I    .  am defined as a bitch.   The same thing happens when I take time for myself instead of being  everyone's maid, or when I act a little selfish. It means I have the courage and  strength to allow myself to be who I truly am and won't become anyone else's idea   of what they think I "should" be.   I am outspoken, opinionated and determined.  I want what I want and there is nothing wrong with that!  So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame, try to squash every  ounce of  beauty I hold within me.  You won't succeed.  And if that makes me a   bitch, so be it. I embrace the title and am proud to bear it.
