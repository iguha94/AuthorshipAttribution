              Are You A Sex Goddess?        A brilliant bolt of lightning descends! SHAZAAM! The oracle has spoken!   The smoke clears to reveal that inside you is a divine being,   DEMETER, Goddess of the Fruitful Earth.   She is a deity who embraces all that man has to offer.  Sex for you is probably just as much of a spiritual experience as it is a physical one. You are an unconventional lover who doesn't feel the need to obey traditional gender roles or follow the norms set by society. Although you are a firm believer in experimentation, you never rush your sexual encounters. It's important for you to experience sex in a deep and profound way. When in the bedroom, you not only surrender your body to the experience, but you allow your mind and your spirit to join the action. Men find you to be a phenomenal lover, and they never fail to be completely elated and fulfilled when the night is over. Sex for you is much more than the sum of its parts. It's an experience that provides you and your partner with an unforgettable moment. For the men who are fortunate enough to share your bed, it's like a light streaming down from the heavens. Behold, the skies proclaim, here lies a goddess!    That's right, boys...you wish you could get a piece of this!  My hubby will be so proud...
