         Talk about hostility...  Yesterday, b had four of his friends come over to play outside...it was pretty funny.  at first, b was trying to run around to get his toys that they were playing with.  after the 100th time of telling him that if he didn't share he would have to have a time out, he resolved that he would just have to make sure they new the toys were his...so he went around "mommy that's my truck"  "mommy that's my car"...to which i kept saying "yes that's your XXX, isn't it fun sharing with XXX?"  i don't think he was convinced this was fun!  But it was so cute to watch a bunch of 21/2 year olds who are only children play but never really play together...they all had their own thing going on and occassionally they would acknowledge each other...like by splashing each other or trying to swipe a toy.  Hubby and I made nice I guess...I decided, be upset or forgive...ughhh...i chose to forgive.  So, I tried to stay awake to see him but wasn't successful, so I just snuggled with him when he came to bed...hopefully, I didn't drool considering I was still pretty much asleep.  Nervous about possibility of seeing mr x tomorrow.  Hubby decided he wanted to go to the richland parade...he knows i saw Mr X last year and i am hoping the reason he wants to go isn't because he wants to hunt him down!  i don't think he would do that...especially because of his career choice, here's hoping!
