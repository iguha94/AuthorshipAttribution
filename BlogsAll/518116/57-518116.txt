         Wow...do you watch Fame?  It was so AWESOME!  Now, I get tired of American Idol...can anyone say follow the beat?  Those kids couldn't dance to save their lives!  I only would watch for Simon's nasty comments so I could yell at him...yeah, exciting life, I know! Anyway...Fame...these kids could sing AND dance...and quite well.  I mean, even the kids that got the boot right away tromped all over the American Idol kids.  Amazing...well, this week was the finale...and, I must red-faced admit...I actually voted!  I wanted Harlemm all the way.  Don't hate, Shannon, cause you have it going on too...but, please, who remembers the last ASIAN short, OLDER (30-something), male that was a POP icon?!  He seemed to have such a sweet heart...Shannon was beautiful, could sing, and dance like a mother, but she is the white female icon we see everywhere.  So, I was allowed five calls, I placed five calls, for Harlemm...and he won!  My faith in voting has been restored!  Mom saw nose ring this week...can we say maniacal?  I could not believe how explosive she was...then she started in on me going to the club...whew, get a life!  I hated to remind her I'm an adult and her manipulation techniques no longer work on me...oh, well, good to see I can still get her blood boiling!  Look out, the number one black sheep of the family is taking back the throne!
