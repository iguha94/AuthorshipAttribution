         Mr X called...so unexpected!  I thought I was in for a looong wait...but he had left a message on my voicemail that I got this morning.  So, of course, I held off until mid-morning and then returned the phone call--can't seem to excited...he said that I took him off guard with the last conversation and he hadn't really known what to say.  He said it kinda freaked him out...okay, I couldn't bring myself to ask what it was that freaked him out--not really sure, but I think he read way too much into my thoughts and questions...  He feels that I need to realize that I am remembering the past and that so much has changed since then...but no matter what, I need to let go of the past because that will never be.  He also said that he wished he could help me figure out why I wasn't happy because that is what he wished for me...that was sweet.  He said that he will support me no matter what I do but that I really need to take some time to think everything through...he wants me to be sure that I do it for me and not out of spite or emotions.  Ah, what age has done for Mr Xs maturity!  Of course, I had to call my voice of reality...she laughed and said it really did sound like we had role-reversed...haha, what a crack-up, my dear!    I think I need some time to digest everything...afterall, the big move is coming up and that is sure to bring so more emotions to the surface...
