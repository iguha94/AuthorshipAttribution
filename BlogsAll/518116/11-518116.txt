         Wow...what a week and a half!!!  I got a call from an old friend...the type of friend that will always hold a special place in your heart, but isn't really a true friend.  I have known her for as long as I can remember...we basically grew up together.  She just doesn't know what it takes to be a good friend.  She will be there for you when it is convenient and when she is not busy with a boy.  It has caused a lot of pain and frustration but I know that people like that are truly the ones that lose.     Anyway, she called and left a message that she just HAD to talk to me.  So, of course, I assumed she was engaged (again) since this is really the only time she wants to talk to me...so I called back.  Boy, was I blown away!  No, she did not get engaged, she got married!!!  Okay, to say that I was shocked would be a major understatement!  All I could say was "wow, congratulations"...hmm... She told me that no she wasn't pregnant...she assumed that this is what I thought--not so!  I just didn't know what to say...I don't really even know him so I can be happy she is happy and pray that it lasts...  Then, I have been trying to get ahold of one of my best friends...his number was disconnected, so I called his brother.  Now, he was dating a girl who just had a baby--not his--and his brother thought it would be funny to tell me he had gotten married...please, my heart can't take it right now!  But no...he just up and went to TX.  Not sure why and not sure for how long.  His brother said he doesn't have a number to reach him...he didn't come back for his sister's wedding...kinda concerns me, that doesn't sound like him.  He was so excited to come for a visit...but hopefully he has email for when I get off my lazy bum and write:)  That's enough drama for now:)
