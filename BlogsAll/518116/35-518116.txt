         yeah...i'm getting nervous...tomorrow is my big "summons".  I printed off my blog because, as usual, the week of my husband starts acting appropriately and I need to remember exactly what has gone on.  she did it...she called her ex today.  i think it is bogus that she waited until 2days before the wedding, but whatever.  She of course was crying...she thinks he was sending mixed signals.  THe guy told her when they were getting off the phone that they would probably never talk to each other again...hmm, not sure what signal that was sending.  I shouldn't be such a bitch.  I don't really know why I am...I think because I am annoyed.  She is so whatever the current conversation is.  Like before, when she told me she didn't have feelings for him...yeah, I pegged that one...then today, she said that it was different for me and mr x because i never had feelings for him like she does for hers.  I said, well, i did, in a weird way, but yeah, i knew i am in a lot better place...yeah, i need to get hit upside the head with a sympathy stick.  I mean, what if mr x was doing well for himself?  Then, it totally would have been harder to cut myself off AGAIN...and if, on top of it, he was getting married...wow...yeah that would suck...i'm a jerk.  I got my raise finally today...and now i have to go...
