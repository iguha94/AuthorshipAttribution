          Stuart Little Saves His Family  Stuart's family was strange enough before he came along - low self-esteem, Mom was a borderline depressive,  Dad couldn't hold a job, and everyone thought they were weird.  Then Stuart (voice of Al Franken) came along, and things got worse.  Stuart looked exactly like a mouse, and never grew to more than 6 inches tall.  But somehow Stuart survived the constant insults by his father (Hugh Laurie), smothering of his mom (Geena Davis), and teasing by his playmates, and became a famous crisis counselor, eventually helping even his own family overcome their special challenges.  We could all learn something from Stuart's daily mantra:  I deserve good things, I am entitled to my share of happiness. I refuse to beat myself up. I am an attractive person. I am fun to be with. For a mouse, anyhow.   Also features Laura San Giacomo as Stuart's sister, and Michael J. Fox as the voice of young Stuart.  Watch for special cameo by Stephen (Flounder) Furst as leader of Stuart's first sensitivity group.  I'm in, Ching.  Woefully underqualified, but in anyhow...  Thanks for your confidence.
