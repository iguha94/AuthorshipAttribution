          Tale of Two Movies  Weird coincidence - I own these two movies, but hadn't seen 1967's The Graduate in 30 years, and had only seen 1973's Heavy Traffic once, when I bought it a couple of years (?) ago.  But it turns out Heavy Traffic is sort of a parallel movie to The Graduate:  Same theme song plays throughout - Scarborough Fair (TG plays Simon and Garfunkel version, HT plays Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66); Both lead characters are young college-aged men; Both leads are accused of being virgins, and go to great legths to prove they're not;  Both leads are accused by their parents of drifting aimlessly and doing nothing with their lives; and Both movies were Rated "X" when they came out - TG later got an "R".  The big contrast is the environment - TG is upper crust and mannered, HT is low rent, crude, and violent.  HT's low budget shows, too - only name I recognized besides animator Bakshi was Jamie Farr (TV M*A*S*H's Klinger) - no clue as to which role he played.  It's now distributed by Orion, but was first released by the infamous American International studio - the definitive lowbrow source for lousy drive-in fare.  The parallels are subtle enough that I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't watched them the same weekend, and even then, I didn't catch it til both movies were over, despite the repeated hearing of Scarborough Fair...
