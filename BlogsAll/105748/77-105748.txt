          Damn Yankee Doodle Dandies   Jimmy Cagney makes a deal with the Devil (Ray Walston) so he can stop doing gangster movies and finally pursue his first love - musical comedy.  Walston puts him through Hell, where he has to listen to Jean Stapleton sing "You Gotta Have Heart".  Most memorable lyrics, at the end, when Walston changes him back to a mobster, trying to ruin his stage act, but Cagney comes through:    "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy,  Yankee Doodle t'rough and t'rough;  a real live nephew of my Uncle Guido,  Ya can't pin nuttin' on me, ya lousy screws!"   Furious at having been outwitted by Cagney, Walston takes a break from daily operation of "the family business", moves in with his nephew (Bill Bixby), disguising his horns as antennae, and convincing Bixby he is Martian, rather than the Prince of Darkness.  All references cheerfully explained, though you'd get them all if you've seen (a) Damn Yankees, (b) a few old Cagney movies, (c) My Favorite Martian, and (d) - helpful but not necessary - All in the Family.  I fixed the bolding thing at my last post by prefixing my post with [/b][/b] - if you do the same, Net, then only Glee's post will be bolded.    Ching, I'm still trying to do the last letter - first letter thing - should I just give it up?
