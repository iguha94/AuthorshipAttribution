         END OF A DYNASTY   -   (The Kennedy Story)   Ching, the movie game was fun in the beginning,  but then it gets old -especially if we start using movie titles that we have nott even seen.    Why don't we agree to start our blogs with current events.  Things we may have heard in the news that day  or that week.  It can be politics,  crimes, sports, fashion, etc.  This way we can continue to share interests.  Like I would be blogging about the Williams sisters finally losing in the Indian Wells tournament.  Well it was always that they were dominating the majors. Like  was always that 2 of them battling it out in the finals.  In the semi finals this year  Venus W had  retire because of a leg injury, he sustained while battling Monica Seles,  so Kim Clisters of Australia won.  Kim has been playing so well tho (girlfriend of current no 1  Hewitt also of Australia).  And Kim finally beat Serena W in the finals, I did not get to watch the game, I was busy running around but I just check the results in the internet.  But when great people play espcially on a one to one situation, I can't miss the ummmmp..... and ahhhhhhhhh as they battle how to close out a point. Can you imagine, they anticipate, run, hit all in one rush of a moment.  Mind you though, you don't have to be interested in ones current events. It would just be a gist in the beginning  and then you can proceed with personal stuff.    I wonder what golf would be like, when I watch it in TV  it makes me fall asleep (not bad).  I heard the Lakers have been losing more now than winning  (Shaq is out for a while because of a foot injury ).  No I don't play any of those games. If I do what's the point of watching other people play.  My game is bowling - I go out every Monday to bowl and be with my friends.
