         Please don't hold those results against me; those ARE my good qualities. just kiddin'      No, no, no. We should NOT have this constitutional amendment that bans same-sex marriage. I was just trying so hard to sound impartial earlier  just so people could check out the issue and the site themselves. However, I'm not impartial. If this amendment passes, it will be part of the U.S. Constitution thus nullifying any state or local laws that permit same-sex marriage or civil unions--some say it may have a negative impact on domestic partnership rights/benefits. Married couples have benefits: health insurance, medical visitation rights, medical decisions involving a sick spouse, custody rights, adoption rights, inheritance/possessions, etc. Same-sex partners cannot have those rights without having a legal union to legitamize their relationship. Okay, I'm done with my ranting and raving.     Hi, Ching, I'm glad the party went well. You flips sure know how to party in Wichita. My girlfriend is Vietnamese, and she observed Filipino families are fun-loving people. I have yet to see FINAL FANTASY.       I have never seen a VCD before. I have seen a VCR/5-disc changer DVD player and a FM radio/VCR/TV. So, once again I'm baffled. Hmmm...speaking of baffled. I cannot view the pic with Dot. Probably something wrong with my computer. *sigh* oh well. I feel like such an airhead. I cannot keep your names straight. Net = Vince, right?  Net + Dot, right? Daf ? Where is Daf?     ARGH! I can't think straight!
