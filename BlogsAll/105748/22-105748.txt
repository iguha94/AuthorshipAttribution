               content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">                             &nbsp;                       Hey Glee, sounds like a         nice service. We had one yesterday in Detroit (downtown's         about 55 miles from my house). Here's the writeup I did         for one of my church music lists:           It wasn't Yankee Stadium, and Pavarotti wasn't there, but it was a glorious worship experience nonetheless.  My soul was well-fed and nurtured.  About a thousand of us jammed into Fort Street Presbyterian Church in downtown Detroit at 4pm on Sunday to pray for peace, justice, and reconciliation.  Catholics, Jews, Baptists, Muslims, Lutherans, Sikhs, Methodists, Hindus, Presbyterians, Baha'i, Orthodox, and more, all praying for the healing of our nation.  Music was provided by the 100+ voice Spiritual Day Tricentennial choir (this year is the 300th anniversary of the founding of Detroit), a number of cantors (or other faiths' versions of cantors), and a very active assembly.  15 - 20 different folks led us in prayer, and provided reflections, including Cardinal Maida, who gave the statement of purpose.  The high points: ALL the music!  (list below) Baptist Rev. Edward Branch's reflection about where God calls us; Presbyterian Rev. Arlene Wallace Gordon's prayer, based on Ps. 24; Imam Abdul Hakim Jackson's reflection about Abraham, our common ancestor in faith (best snippet for the day - &quot;always act in faith and obedience, let God provide the results&quot;); Prayer litany led by 3 middle school kids - one Muslim girl, one Jewish boy, one Christian girl the common thread through ALL the prayers and reflections - the shared faith and purpose that unite us.  Here's what I know of the song list:  Prelude:  Spiritual Day Tricentennial Choir (I only caught the tail end, and did not recognize the songs, but participated where I could, when invited) Opening: America the Beautiful, assembly and choir Hymn: O God, Our Help (St. Anne, new verses by Carolyn Gillette - I'll put them below with copyright info), assembly and choir Musical Interlude:  Battle Hymn (cool arrangement for B-3 and drums), choir ..........................:  Total Praise (Smallwood), choir (those of us who know (and LOVE) this joined in) Chanted prayer by Jeremy Campion of the Muslim Unity Center Chanted prayer by (n?) from the Hindu temple Closing: T'filat Haderich (Traveler's Prayer), cantor Stephen Dubov of Temple Beth El and assembly - lyrics below   O God Our Help, extra verses: ----------------------------------------------- O God, our words cannot express the pain we feel this day; Enreged, uncertain, we confess our need to bow and pray.  We grieve for all who lost their lives and for each infured one; We pray for children, husbands, wives whose grief has just begun.  O Lord, we're called to offer prayer for all our leaders, too; May they, amid such great despair be wise in all they do.  We trust your mercy and your grace; In you we will not fear! May peace and justice now embrace!  Be with your people here!  copyright  2001, Carolyn Winfrey Gillette, 305 S. Broadway, Pitman NJ 08071.  All rights reserved.    T'filat Haderich (Traveler's Prayer) ----------------------------------------------- May we be blessed as we go on our way. May we be guided in peace. May we be blessed with health and joy.   May this be our blessing.  Amen.  May we be sheltered by the wings of peace. May we be kept in safety and love. May grace and compassion find their way to every soul. May this be our blessing.  Amen.  (no copyright info given)  Jay
