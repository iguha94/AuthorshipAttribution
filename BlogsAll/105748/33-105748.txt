         Hey, Ching and everyone!  I was thinking of updating my Amazon wishlist, but I'm just soo busy. So, here's a list of birthday wishes: relaxing CDs for massage, Ani DiFranco's Little Castle (? or was it Little Pink Castle?) CD, The Complete Works of Audre Lourde (sp?), blank journals, books on Reflexology or Reiki or hilot, pens, stationery, twin-sized cotton flannel sheet sets, aromatherapy candles, organic essential oils, organic cooking spices, vegetarian cookbooks with quick and easy recipes for the single busy person, books on copywrite laws, books on grantwriting...Well, you get the idea. Heck, if you are on the creative bent. Just send me a friendly letter in a decorated (mailart) envelope.    Ching, can you give me some tips, pointers about starting my own personal blog?   I'm going to read at Listen & Be Heard: open mic and jam session tomorrow on my birthday night. My parents are going to treat me for a birthday dinner and then I will have to go it alone at the mic. I practically had to lie by saying I had a business appointment (when I really was going to an open mic poetry event). How long do you think I could keep up hiding the fact that I'm going on tour, creating a book, and aspiring to get on Oprah? My mother is very concerned. She keeps telling me: "Be careful what you write." I think it's her own fears and her own hiya that's acting up.
