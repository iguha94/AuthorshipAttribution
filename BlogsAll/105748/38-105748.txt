         SHREK is my all-time favorite animated movie!  We saw ICE AGE several days ago, but I didn't think it was as good.  I like it, but I still liked SHREK better.  I still haven't seen MONSTERS INC.  We missed it completely when it came out in theaters.  We're waiting for it to be released on DVD so we can watch it.  I heard it's very good.  I still think SHREK will be my favorite for a while, though.    We saw RESIDENT EVIL last week.  It was awesome!  I love Mila Jovovich.  She's so hot!  Michelle Rodriguez was great, too... But she turned into a zombie!  Yikes!  We're planning on watching BLADE 2 this Monday.  I'm excited already!    BTW, I heard about Netflix.  Brian and I were seriously considering signing up.. After all, we are certified movie buffs.  The only thing is, you are limited to three DVDs at any given time.  They won't send you additional ones until you've returned some of the DVDs.. I don't know if they still have that rule.. But when we were thinking about it last year, they had that rule in place.  It kind of turned us off to the whole thing (Brian and I will rent five DVDs all at once sometimes -- yes, we really need to get a life).  Anyway, it helps if you have hook-ups at Hollywood Video.  You won't have to pay at all!! LOL.
