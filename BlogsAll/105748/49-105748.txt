         Ching, you'd love this scene I'm caught up into right now. Rafael's Bar is like the best kept secret in V-town, Vallejo, CA for those not hip to West Coast rap.    Yes, I have done my share of drinking, April. Joe, the Rafael's owner--a  fine pinoy brother who is single BTW, keeps hooking all us up with shots of GOODNESS-KNOWS-WHAT. He also cooks kick-ass filipino and american food in his joint.   I LOVE WHAT I DO! I'm the in-house poet of the most happening scenes in all of Vallejo, I'm a founder of a touring spoken word group, I'm going to be a Reiki Master, and...and...and [*panting* running out of breath]. Oh, and my girl and I are back together again. She is soo sweet. I'm gonna kick myself if I ever hurt again.   I need to call up an attorney so I can I draw up a release form so that I can use Oprah's name for my book title. Since when poets could afford lawyers?   Speaking of Oprah, did you know she was on the cover of FORTUNE magazine? This is the woman I'm supposed to draw up legal papers for? [shivers in fright]   Ching, I will try to chat once I get another computer. I feel weird chatting at the public library computer center.   Monty Python is da bomb! I love the movie THE MEANING OF LIFE. "just one thin mint..."   Angelina Jolie is hot, but then again, I have this secret admiration for freaky, outspoken, weirdoes with amazing talent. Well, then again, her boobs aren't nothing to yawn about. :P' ' '      Someone called me "a giant freak" the other day. I told him, "I resent that! I only stand four foot eleven!"
