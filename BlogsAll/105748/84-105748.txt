         Thanks guys!  I was forced to buy my own hosting coz my free one was deleted without any notice whatsoever.  Ching and I were not sure why that happened but, oh well it was time to move on.  Besides, I always get comments from people about the pop-ups that comes out everytime my free site loads.  At least now I don't have to worry about that.  I love my hosting!  They've got lots of cool features.  I wanted to make sure to take advantage of it.  Ching and I already tried the built in chatroom, guestbook, and forum.  It's very convenient.  Anyhow, thanks Daf for signing my guestbook.  I went and visited your site as well coz I haven't stopped by there in a while.  I noticed you took out your Enetation commenting system.  It's all good though, I had your email address so I wrote you back.  Did you receive it?    In regards to Net's comment, I hope my site didn't cause your computer problems.  I definitely think there was something wrong with blogger.  It took me a while to post my blog yesterday because I kept on getting error messages.  Right now, it looks like it's working.  I don't want to jinx it.    BTW, I read the Goldensushi articles.  You guys are so awesome.  Keep up the great work.  Everyone's piece were very entertaining to read.  I look forward to reading some more.  :)  In response to comments on my really long domain name, I didn't really realize how long it was until Ching brought it to my attention.  By then it was already too late to change it.  Besides, my first name choice was already taken.
