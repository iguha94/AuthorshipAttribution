         PDA's are everywhere these days.  But how many of us utilize its capabilities beyond the things to do, the date book, or the optional camera attachment?  I myself own a Palm III which was handed down to me when Dot's cousin no longer had a use for it.  I tucked away my good old paper filled Filofax midway in June of 2002 and never looked back to it unless my PDA ran out of batteries and I had to re enter all my phone contacts.  When we upgraded to a new computer I installed the back up data into it.  I was reading   Meryl's column  in   Lockergnome  and it got me to thinking about the other things that I could do if I ever upgraded.  These days   Palm's  plethora of PDA's (try saying that a dozen times) can do lots more.  Camera, Phone, Internet, Email.  Then I got to thinking, will I ever get to use these services when I upgrade?  I barely use anything else in my Palm III besides the usual datebook and things to do.  Okay, so maybe Ill upgrade if blogger.com will let me blog it via email. Maybe, I can send Jaba a memo on why we need a new laminating machine.  Maybe, I can send a pic to MM about how messy the store looks when I come in to work on Sunday morning.  Whatever the case may be, I think that we all take for granted what our electronic personal assistants can do and I believe for most of us we use our PDA's for show like those people that come into the store and they're talking up a storm on their cellular phones as they approach the front counter.  So, what do you use your PDA for?
