          YENTL    In my boyscouting days,  Angelicum School let us conduct our camping at the soccer field.  Then rumor started spreading amongs the troops that the field and the whole school used to be a cemetary and that the elementary building was believed to be haunted by a "White Lady".  Some of us decided to investigate this phenomena so that evening we crawled out of our tents taking care that non of the ScoutMasters saw us and sneaked up to the third floor of the Elementary building.  We shined our flashlights to get our bearings.  It was a full moon that night so we could see shadows.  Then all of a sudden it got really cold.  All ten of us felt it. I looked at my friend in the eye and as I turned back towards my peers we all saw the "White Lady" floating and moving away from us.  We all screamed and ran down the stairs and back to our camp site.  Obviously, we awakened the ScoutMasters and they were not happy about the situation.  For punishment, we were told to squat in a line up for a half hour.  It made my legs cramp up but it was better that being with the white lady.  We never fessed up about what we saw but for me it felt real.   More to come... NET
