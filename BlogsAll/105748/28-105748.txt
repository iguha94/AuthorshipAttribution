         More movies:   Cider House Rules  - excellent character development, real tear-jerky, Charlize Theron is hot hot hot (!!!), and the male lead (forgot his name?) reminds me a whole bunch of a friend of mine.  Pro-abortion stance might be disturbing to some, as well as an incest subplot, but very well done.  Best role Michael Caine's had in years!   Caligula  - always wondered what was up with this one - what happens when a star-studded cast (Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud) works a movie produced by Bob Guccione?  Boy, did we ever find out!  I knew it'd be graphic, but the violence was downright evil!  And though I expected sex, I didn't expect stroker porn - but there it was - big 15 minute (?) orgy scene near the end, played like any other porn movie, except slightly better photography, and the sound of Malcolm McDowell hollering in the background instead of a fuzak soundtrack.  Kim hated it, I thought O'Toole and McDowell were very good, though McDowell was uneven.  And I did rewatch the orgy once more, but felt appropriately dirty and ashamed afterwards.   The Players Club  - Tawdry drama set in a black strip club.  Far enough outside my cultural experience that I question my judgment on it, but didn't really ring true.  Female lead was pretty good, and Jamie Foxx was likeable, but the criminal element was really two-dimensional.  Daf
