         I will be offering domain hosting soon.&nbsp; I'm informing members first because once I launch the web design/development section of Golden Sushi the hosting prices will go up.&nbsp; Members still get their free hosting  (http://www.goldensushi.net/~you) ; that will not change..&nbsp; But if you want to upgrade to domain hosting  (http://www.yourname.com) , now is the time to do it!       For only  $50/year  you'll get the following:    30MB disk space  12GB  UNLIMITED EMAIL ACCOUNTS  FTP ACCESS, WEB UPLOAD UTILITY  NO ADS, TECH-SUPPORT  Just about everything you can imagine!          GeoCities  charges  $8.95/month  plus a $15 set-up fee for less features.&nbsp; This truly is an excellent deal!&nbsp; I won't charge you any set-up fees or anything like that.&nbsp; If you've already got your own domain name, then all you will be responsible for is the  $50/year  (THAT'S ABOUT  $4/month  -- AT THIS RATE, YOU CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT) hosting fee.&nbsp; If I have to register your domain for you, it's an additional  $20/year  (or $30 for two years -- a $10 savings).&nbsp; Again, the rates will go up after the Golden Sushi hosting launches.&nbsp; This same offer will be $70/year without domain registration and $100/year with one year of domain registration (the rates are still very competitive, compared to other webhosts like GeoCities as you can see)..&nbsp; But I'm offering a deal to those who want get in on it before the hosting launch.     Interested parties please email me (webmaster@goldensushi.net) ASAP!
