          Anna and The King Kong  Try teaching english to a bunch of young apes fathered by the Giant of all monkeys who once climbed top of the Empire State Building.  Happy Chinese New Year to all! Spent the last 48 hours in Edison New Jersey.  I helped set up 1000 balloons for Dot's Aunt who owns a   Bridal Store .  Not knowing that I was voted to be the play the part of Emperor in the New Year Float!  Friday night, Dot help me try on this outfit for the King.  Its a traditional, yellow, chinese outfit.  Then I helped Dot try on her Queen outfit.  I must say we looked pretty good!  Ill post pictures later.  Early Saturday morning, I was awaken by Dot's cousin who told me that I had to get ready so that I can drive them to the store to get ready for the parade.  I took a quick shower and drove them over.  It was pretty hectic at the store.  The people from Hometown Buffet came over to put on their outfits - they were the Traditional Chinese wedding entourage.  Dot quickly got her hair set and started to don her Queen outfit.  I went to finish up the last of the balloons for the float and began putting on the Emperor's clothes.  Dot's parents finally arrive 2 hours before the parade and made us aware that it was starting to drizzle outside. The parade went on anyway even for the minor drizzle everyone came out to see the drummers on parade with the tai chi dancers and a bunch of dragons and a couple of marching bands.  I am still not that well with the language but here goes...     Gung Shi Fa Chai  ....=)   More to come NET
