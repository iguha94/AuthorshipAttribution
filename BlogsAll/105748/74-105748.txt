          EXIT to EDEN   Went to the Broadway Mall in Hicksville today.  Yes, Hicks ville is a real town here in New York.   Anyhoot, Dot and I walked into the local Delias and were looking at the clearance items in the back of the store.  As Dot was looking for clothes for her little cousins, I spied this book called Girlfriend Slam Book.  I was going over this book when I had the idea that this can also be used for Single Mans Slam Book.  It has subject lines like  Name Address yada yada yada.  But, it also has lines like Zodiac Sign, Likes, Dislikes and also a GIRL-O-Meter which can be called a HOT-O-Meter for the single guys.  I also liked the section where you can put a photo of the girl you are Slamming.  Dot didnt find it amusing, but I certainly did.  Moving right along, our next shop attack was the Disney Store.  They had 10 dollar medium stuff toys which I found highly unusual because Disney rarely puts anything less than 10 dollars unless the item was little trinkets.  I spied on the new electronic Stitch stuff toy which talks back at you.  The responses become repetitive after 8 or so statements but I found it amusing for 15 minutes.  I had 3 Stitches talking to each other by the time Dot passed by to pull me out of the store.  The Disney welcome girl didnt find my networking the Stitches very amusing.  They were still talking to each other when we met up with Dots cousin Kathy and we decided to revisit Disney.  Speaking of silly gifts.  Be on the lookout in the mail if youre an avid receiver of the Victorias Secret catalog.  They send this post card for a FREE yes thats right FREE Panty just for visiting your local VS.  Dot picked up her free panty and I got the opportunity to see the latest thongs on the mannequins and also on the sales clerks as they bent over to pick up boxes on the floors, God bless em.     more to come.
