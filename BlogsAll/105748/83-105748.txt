         Ching, the 'view web page' is linked to -   http://www.blogger.com/ching.imess.net/blog/ . Maybe thats why April's computer is having trouble finding the web page.  I backed spaced and deleted www.blogger.com/ from the   URL  and it brought me to Golden Sushi's Blog.  Anyhoot, I have been tossing this idea in my head to write about XML and OPML.  Lately, this has been my learning focus so be sure to watch for it in your mailbox and post it.  Friday will probably the day I finish this topic.  For those of you that have walked past   myBlog  especially on April fools day, you might have discovered something peculiar with it.  Golden Sushi's Blog was even the victim of my exploits last week.  Anyway, I will post a topic about this in the next 2 weeks.  BTW, Dot and I have decided to move in together.  She bought this house in Flushing, NY for 345K simoleons.  Of course, She and I get to have our own rooms.  Living together doesnt mean living in sin (wink) her mother has given testament that I shall not commit her daughter to the pillages of the devil. =)  Moving right along, I have given thoughts to putting up a webcam at her townhouse after we paint and fix up the place.  That should appease Mrs. Chao and so all the voyeurs out there can take a peek on   No Pants Fridays .  more to come...
