          Hey Ching!   I'm still agnostic on the details.  We're trying to know the unknowable, prove the unprovable.  As (my hero) Douglas Adams pointed out, a God who requires faith of his people isn't going to provide proof, 'cos then who needs faith?  I chose Catholicism (after growing up Presbyterian) so I could worship with my wife and kids, and 'cos I like some of the Catholic music, and they invited me to play in their ensemble.  I accept our theological assertions as possible, but, of course, unprovable.   I spent a long time away from the church... 18-28, I think.  And really only active in the last 9-10 years.  It was easy to walk away, and kind of hard to come back.  Glad I did, though.   And you may have heard this before, but atheism requires as much faith as the most stringent forms of Christianity, because atheists are saying, essentially, that they believe there's nothing beyond their perception or understanding (or that they understand the things that ARE beyond their understanding well enough to know that whatever causes them, it's NOT God).   In my case, I was visited, near as I can tell, by the Holy Spirit, who gave me a fully arranged 6-part-harmony gospel-style setting of the Gloria.  I'd never composed anything even halfway good before, then all of a sudden BAM!  Woke up in the middle of the night, song wouldn't go away for 3 days, 'til I finally sat down and charted it out.  My choir (this was back before I was a director) loved it, and it brought down the house when we debuted it Christmas Eve 1996.   So it's easy to believe when something like that happens to you.  It's much tougher without any overt contact - then it REALLY takes faith.   Sorry if any of this sounded like preaching.  Not my intent.  I'm glad to see you've got an open mind about it!     And I hope your sister straightens out soon.  Her baby needs her clean and sober.   Daf
