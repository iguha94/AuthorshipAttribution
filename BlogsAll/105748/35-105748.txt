           1.   What's the most romantic thing you've ever done for someone else?    In '87, when I moved to DC, Kim stayed in Detroit with the kids for 4 months.  It was really hard being apart.  One weekend I flew home without telling her, had friends drop me at the restaurant two blocks from our house, and called and told her to come to the porch - I was having a present delivered.  I walked down the street and up the driveway.  She was in tears.    2.   [pardon the cosmo question] What are your erogenous zones?    Uh, the usual.    3.   How old were you the first time you had sex? Care to expound?    16.  On a church retreat with a bunch of kids I didn't know.  Fran was 17, and, to this day, the most unattractive girl I've ever been with.  I wasn't ready for this, and it showed.  Monumentally unsatisfying.   4.   What's the most unusual place you've ever had sex?    In an Amtrak sleeper room.  A little cramped, but still nice.    5.   Do you have plans for Valentine's Day or is it just another Thursday?    I'll be working.  Probably overtime.  Sometimes this job really sucks (like RIGHT NOW!  75 damn hours this week.  Aaagh!).  Besides, it'll be Lent.  No fun allowed.     Daf
