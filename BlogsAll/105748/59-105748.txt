          YOU'VE GOT MAIL   Watched  Queen of the Damned  yesterday.. Not as bad a everyone said it was.  Not as good as I expected it to be either.  Spent the day hanging out with Jen.  But first, Brian and I took our two cats to the vet.. Oh, yeah!  I haven't told you guys yet.  Brian finally broke down and got me a kitten!  It's all black & super-cute!  His name is Felix.  We took Felix and Hobbie to the vet yesterday..  Then Brian went off to work and I stayed home with the full intention of veggin' out.  Jen calls me up to have lunch with her so I find myself getting up to go to Applebee's.  I buy lunch to bring to Brian for a mid-afternoon snack.  After lunch, Jen and I go to Planet Hair for my much-needed haircut.  My waist-length hair has been reduced to above the shoulders.. It's a modified bob.. Very much like the hairstyle that I had when I was a senior in high school.  Brings back memories..   Anyhow, we go shopping at the mall.  I took Jen to A&F and to Hollister Co. next door..  Redeemed my Express coupon.. Got some Orange Julius, etc.  After that we came back home to try on our finds.  Jen wanted to watch  Legally Blonde  one of my all-time favorite movies (I love Reese Witherspoon -- I can't wait until  Sweet Home Alabama  is released!).  We load it on the DVD and watch.. We wait for Brian to get home from work.  Dinner was at mom and dad's: porkchops & leftover sinigang.  Yum!  Did some karaoke on the "magic mic."  Watched the US Open women's finals..   This morning we had brunch with Brian's family at Legends.. Good food!  It's his mom's birthday tomorrow..  Anyway, we're going to go see  Swim Fan  later tonight with Kevin and Stephanie.  That should be good.  On Wednesday we get our Road Runner -- yippee!!  I'm so excited I don't think I'll be able to sleep for the next three days!
