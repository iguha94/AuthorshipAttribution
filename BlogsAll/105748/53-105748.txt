          NELL   Just got done watching "Strange Days" --- never seen it before.. Saw it on TV while channel-surfing.  Totally intriguing.. I ask Brian what it's all about as I usually do with movies because I know he's seem them all.  Annoyed, he dismisses my question and tells me that I have to watch it from the beginning in order for it to make sense.  And he goes, "I've got it here somewhere -- if you haven't sold it yet.."  So I watch it in the bedroom while I'm ironing.  Pretty good.  Makes you think.  Didn't James Cameron do "Titanic"?  How can the same guy make "Strange Days" and then turn around and make a movie like "Titanic"?  It doesn't add up!  Then again, a dollar's a dollar..  Brian's just relieved that I have something else to do other than pester him to get off the computer so I can take my turn.  Needless to say, the movies over and I bumped him off the computer.  Shoot, he was just playing Star Trek Armada II, anyway!  It's not like he's writing a manifesto.  Which, if he were, I'd be really worried.  The last thing I need is to be married to a Ted Kazinski wannabe.  What is the deal with those strategy games anyway?  Am I the only one who doesn't get it?  They're all freaking the same!!  Speaking of games, we ran to Best Buy last night at 8:45 PM -- 15 minutes before closing time thinking that we'd buy Tekken 4.. It doesn't even come out until September 25!! Some wacko worker at Best Buy told Brian that it was coming yesterday!  They should give us something for wasting our freaking time!  I need some compensation, dammit!!
