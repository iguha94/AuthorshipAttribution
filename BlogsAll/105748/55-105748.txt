         Heres a story I received in E-mail.  I found it ironic.  Its probably made its round trip in email fwds. Anyway, read on:    A city boy, Kenny, moved to the country and bought a donkey from an old   farmer for $100.00. The farmer agreed to deliver the donkey the next day    The next day the farmer drove up and said, "Sorry son, but I have some   bad news, the donkey died."   Kenny replied, "Well then, just give me my money back."    The farmer said, "Can't do that. I went and spent it already."    Kenny said, "OK then, just unload the donkey."    the farmer asked, "What ya gonna do with him?" Kenny said, "I'm going to raffle him off."   Farmer, "You can't raffle off a dead donkey!"    Kenny, "Sure I can.  Watch me. I just won't tell anybody he is dead."    A month later the farmer met up with Kenny and asked, "What happened  with that dead donkey?"    Kenny, "I raffled him off. I sold 500 tickets at two dollars a piece and made a profit of $898.00."    Farmer, "Didn't anyone complain?"    Kenny, "Just the guy who won. So I gave him his two dollars back."    Kenny grew up and eventually became the chairman of Enron.     More to come...  ~NET
