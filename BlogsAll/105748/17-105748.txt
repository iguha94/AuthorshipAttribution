          Express makes me feel so FAT !      I've been wanting these hip-slung, light-weight jeans from J.Crew for a while now (a while = 48 hours)..&nbsp; but the money is tight (the jeans are $68 bucks) and I can't afford to be buying everything that I want on whim.&nbsp;  Anyhow, I saw this add in a catalog for some Levi's 518 jeans..&nbsp; I was like, "Wow ! &nbsp; Only $42 dollars ! &nbsp;  This is it.&nbsp;  We're there ! "    So we go to the mall right after we drop my friend Misty off at the airport (a whole 'nother story in itself).&nbsp;  We went to both Dillard's and J.C. Penny with disappointing results.&nbsp;  The good thing was, they were cheaper at the mall.&nbsp;  At Dillard's they were only $35 and at J.C. Penny they were $29.99 ~~ shows you how much of a difference it makes going to the right store.&nbsp;  The bad news was that it didn't come in my size:&nbsp;  Levi's 518 don't come in S (short length).&nbsp;  I so wanted to cry ! &nbsp;  More and more, those $68 hip-slung jeans from J.Crew were looking good.    Brian talks me into going to Express.&nbsp; I hadn't been there in a while..&nbsp;  We try to stay away from Express because everytime I go there I end up dropping $200. This time around I only spent $60 and got a pair of jeans, a v-neck shirt, and a $25 Fast Cash coupon (for $25 off any $50 purchase) out of it.&nbsp; Not bad, considering that for $70 all I would get from J.Crew would be a pair of jeans (and a $10 gift card ~~ it's their current promotion).    I'm a 3/4 in Express jeans (in skirts, I'm still a 1/2), though ! &nbsp; Can you believe it?&nbsp;  At least J.Crew jeans make me think I'm really a size 2.&nbsp;  I still like those hip-slug, light-weight, aged denim jeans, though..&nbsp;So today, I'm going to return a pair of J.Crew jeans that I received the other day and exchange them for the new ones that I like !   =)
