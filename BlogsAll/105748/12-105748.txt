         I kind of like  Web Cloggers , but we'll leave it open for other suggestions.&nbsp; If there are no other suggestions that are better than  Web Cloggers  by the 20th of this month then that will be the name of our blog.&nbsp; What do you guys think?    Speaking of tests, Brian took the Gender Test and   TheSpark  said he was a woman.&nbsp; 83% sure, to boot ! &nbsp; I took the test and it guessed me to be a woman also.&nbsp; So basically, Brian and I are a lesbian couple.&nbsp; Kidding ! &nbsp; It's really not that accurate I suppose.&nbsp; Perhaps not enough people have taken the test.    We had a barbecue at our house yesterday to celebrate the Fourth of July.&nbsp; It was a small one.&nbsp; We were expecting just Brian's parents, Brian and I.&nbsp; Brian's mom canceled because she wasn't feeling good.&nbsp; Earlier that afternoon we (Donna, Dave, Kevin, Brian and I) had all gone to watch  A.I.  (it reminded me of  Bicentennial Man , but I liked  Bicentennial Man  better because it actually made me cry ~~ Brian says  A.I.  would've made me cry, I just wasn't in the mood for it).&nbsp; I think the heat may have gotten to her.&nbsp; It was really hot out yesterday.&nbsp; It was affecting my mood: I was being sorta grumpy.    Instead, Brian's granparents (Clark and Betty) and his dad came.&nbsp; Brian grilled some pork chops and we had corn on the cob and mashed potatoes.&nbsp; We also had some cantaloupe and watermelon.&nbsp; Brian and Dave (his dad) opted to skip the fruits and go for Nest&eacute; Crunch ice cream bars instead.&nbsp; Dinner was really delicious.&nbsp; Brian and I are getting good use out of his grill.&nbsp; I don't regret buying it for him.    We played a game of Scrabble to kill time because it was still bright outside.&nbsp; I won.&nbsp; After Scrabble it was dark enough to start blowing up fireworks.&nbsp; We had quite a few: mostly sparklers, nothing illegal (except for the free firecrackers that the store was giving away).&nbsp; It was a lot of fun.&nbsp; I think Brian's grandparents really enjoyed themselves.&nbsp; How did you guys spend your holiday?
