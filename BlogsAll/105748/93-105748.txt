         I got some terrible news yesterday.  My grandmother's sister Laurie Palad passed away in her sleep Sunday.  It was found that she had a heart attack during her sleep.  In the last 8 years her life was plagued with a lot of hardship.  I am surprised she as persevered this long.  Lola Laurie's husband, Lolo Sammy passed away about 8 years ago.  Their estate in Cubao, Quezon City was split up between her and her daughter Joy and son Niels.  Tita Joy decided to sell her part of the property to someone and they put up an apartment building right in front of Lola Laurie's home.  Two years ago, Tito Niels, killed himself in an apparent suicide leaving his wife with 2 kids to feed and the rest of Lola Laurie's estate from Lolo Sammy.  We will be sending money to help pay for her burial since Tito Niels' money is still under litigation from his wife who doesnt want to give a single centavo for Lola Laurie.  I asked my mother if she had life insurance and mom says that it was all set up by Lolo Sammy and when he died it was split up between Niels and Joy.  Its all a big mess.  Please pray for her safe passage to heaven.  Of all the souls in purgatory that need a to go straight to heaven its Lola Laurie.  God bless her soul...
