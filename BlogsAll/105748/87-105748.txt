         I just discovered something loopy!  If WIN2K is your OS and you are operating your blog or web page in PHP or some other language other than html, you will find that the site shows a cache version of the document in internet explorer 6.0.  I discovered that when blogger was uploading all its user's blogs to   DANO .  My   blog site  in blogspot would always show up as a cache file until I removed the template I was using and loaded one of the   current blog  templates used under DANO.  Blogger was posting blogs that were not in DANO under a folder called 'no cache'.  IE6 could not locate the index.html file so it would always show what it had in the network server's cache file.  This of course wouldn't happen on home computers since the cache file on your computers automatically gets updated everytime you visit a website unless of course you tweeked IE6 differently.  So for those of you that are using Blogger for your blog please point to an index.html.  For those of you that are using PHP in your web servers, have the PHP script point to an index.html file.  For those of you that are lazy to create an index.html file in Blogger just recreate your template when your blog gets moved over to DANO.  For those of you that are dazed and confused with this current post, go back to bed and dream of golem and the butterflies...(_)_)
