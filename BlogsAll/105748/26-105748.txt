         Sorry I've been out of commish for a while.&nbsp; Things have been somewhat hectic over here.&nbsp; I have not seen  Caligula .&nbsp; Brian, who is very opinionated when it comes to movies, has seen it -- but he has no desire to see it again.&nbsp; I guess I am out of luck.    I saw  A Clockwork Orange  a while back.&nbsp; I think I wrote a paper on several years ago.&nbsp; I own it on video and and I have the book which has the crucial final chapter that was conveniently omitted from the movie version.&nbsp; It's one of my all-time favorites.    Speaking of movies,  Final Fantasy  is now available on DVD.&nbsp; Brian and I bought it today at Sam's Club.&nbsp; We had to call his parents to bail us out because we needed to buy food for our barbecue this afternoon and both our Sam's Club cards were expired.&nbsp; And Sam's was the only place we could get 40 hamburger patties for less than 10 bucks !     The action figure cake toppers gave Brian and I a wonderful idea.&nbsp; We're going to be copy cats and use action figures as our cake toppers, too ! &nbsp; Brian loved the idea because he is an avid action figure collector.&nbsp; When I first read your message, Glee, I got very excited..&nbsp; "I know exactly which action figure I want to represent me ! " I told Brian.&nbsp; He thought I was going to pick Xiaoyu from the video game Tekken (because I kick ass at the game when I play her -- I am totally invincible, except when Brian selects Eddie Gordo, his strongest character, to play against me).&nbsp; He was completely surprised when I told him that I choose Elektra (from Marvel Comics).&nbsp; "Then I'll be Logan," he says.&nbsp; "Wolverine?&nbsp; Why?" I asked.&nbsp; Brian explains that Elektra and Logan had some sort of relationship 8 years ago.&nbsp; Of course, only a handful of people will know the significance of the characters we selected.&nbsp; I'm so excited already.&nbsp; My mom will literally flip out !
