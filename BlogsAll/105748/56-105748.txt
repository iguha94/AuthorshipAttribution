          SEND ME NO FLOWERS   Doris Day, Rock Hudson, Tony Randall.  'Twas a simpler time, everyone kept their clothes on, no one had skeletons in the closet (poor Rock), girls just dreamed of marriage, which equaled life happily ever after.  Kim LOVES these movies.  I find them wholly irrelevant, but I DO love Kim, so watch them we do...  My vacation starts today - two weeks off!  Yippee!  I'm flying out to Washington State, will meet up with my brother Matt, we'll be visting our stepmom, Dorothy, and help settle Dad's estate.  He died last year, and, we imagine, left everything to Dorothy, but she had mementos, clothes, and the like to pass along.  She lives on the Olympic Peninsula, which is my favorite place in the whole world - mountains, rivers, lakes, rain forests, and the ocean all within an hour - rarely colder than 40 or hotter than 80, and, though most of the peninsula is rainy, she's in a town, Sequim, that only gets 18 inches annual rainfall - they even have to irrigate the farms.  I'll also be meeting up with my son Andy, his new bride Sarah, and their son Wesley.  I bought their tickets (don't believe the ads -   Travelocity  came up way cheaper than   Hotwire ).  Ching knows a bit of the   Andy story  - anyhow, we're trying to put the past behind us and be a family.  We had dinner this past Monday, and I finally got to meet Wesley, first time since he came home from the hospital over two years ago.  Dinner went well, we're all hoping things keep going smoothly.  The Washington trip is only 5 days - the rest's going to be around Michigan - I still have class, but maybe Kim and I can get away for a few days.  That would be nice.  Oh, and Net - you have to go back and fix your recycle - has to start with Y and end with S.  I imagine this game will get a lot harder down the road when we've used up a bunch of the movies we all know.
