         Hi y'all!  I just had a dental cleaning last thursday.  I must say that my dentist was very thorough especially when he was told that I have never been to a dentist in over eight years!  His assistant took x-rays of my molars and also a 360 degree x-ray of all my teeth.  I must say that a lot of technology has overtaken the dental industry.  I could have never imagined how technolgy could invade such a profession, but it has.    I was amazed about the data transfer capabilities of my dentist.  He has another assistant at the front who took all my information and placed it on the computer database.  This database was shared thru out the entire office via ethernet cables and my dentist accessed it on the network like a snap of a finger (well, he really did his fingers do the walking by typing it on a keyboard).  The next technology?  X-ray of course!  His assistant took xrays of my teeth and automatically was data transferred to my files.  All my dentist had to do was pull up my xray folder and voila! On the computer screen were my molars with little rectangles which were my fillings!    Its too bad that the dentist could not automate the cleaning process.  Still had to drill and pick and use that suction/vaccuum system to work on my teeth.  Result? After over 8 long years, I have great looking teeth sans the yellowing from occasional smoking.  See you in six months doc...        </post>
