         Whew! Its about time   The Debut   came out on DVD.  It's been touring the US for over 2 years now.  It came to NYC last year but I missed out in seeing it.  They decided that they will only release it in certain theaters out in Manhattan. Boooo! After much hooplah and long waits in line. I decided not to watch it in the movies thinking it was going to be out on DVD/VCD soon anyway.  I would like to see it on the big screen sometime.  Maybe they will offer to put it up for a viewing at the Consulate where they show artsy stuff sometimes.  And they show it for FREE!  I love free.  Dot and I splurged this week and bought a DELL Dimension with a DVD burner.  One thing one must put in mind when buying a DVD burner is the compatibility factor.  We went to Best Buys which had DVD media on sale.  The problem was that the media they had on sale wasnt compatible with our burner.   If you buy a DVD Rewritable.  The media you should get has to be a  DVD + R .  Any other version will not work.  However, you can still view DVDs that are already burned.  If you have a DVD Recorder you must look at the specs because there are several medias out there that cannot be mixed and matched for DVD recording.  Theres the DVD R, a DVD-R, and your DVD+R that I already talked about.  Needless to say, I ended up back at Best Buys yesterday to return my useless purchase.  Be on the look out for any deals for DVD+R media.  Dot is dying to try out our new toy...
