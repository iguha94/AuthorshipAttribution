          TEXASVILLE   The twenty-years-later sequel to "The Last Picture Show" - I love Larry McMurtry!   "Thanks for the tip, Net..."   Jay/Daf here, Ching - all us guys look the same?  Oh, and thanks for the motel story link - I love English articles where the punchlines are in Tagalog.  Phhtphhtphht!  Maybe you heard our motel story before - apologies if so.  The rest aren't repeatable!  We got married on a Fall Sunday (1978) in a Detroit suburb, and were going to honeymoon in Chicago, but I had a band gig that ran 'til 2am.  We were going to try to drive through, but after 2 hours, we had only made it to Jackson (MI), and I was falling asleep.  so we pulled off at an exit, and found the dumpiest motel I'd ever seen, but we were too exhausted to go on.  so we grabbed a room, tried to make the best of it, but the couple in the next room was incredibly loud.  All night long, the girl was shouting  "Ohh, Walter!  Unnhh-unnhh-unnhh-yes!  Walter!  Walter!"   Kim was just miserable - the first night of our eternity together, and we get loud amateur porn through the wall all night.  She cried herself to sleep.  We woke up the next morning to more of Walter and his loud friend - not sure if the headboard was slamming into the wall, or her head was slamming into the headboard.  The rest of the honeymoon was much nicer - a highrise hotel in downtown Chicago with a view of the Lake from our room, and an excellent romantic restaurant downstairs.  And "Ohh Walter..." is still a running joke, probably 'cos I won't let it die, but Kim pretends not to think I'm an idiot.  Isn't she just the best?
