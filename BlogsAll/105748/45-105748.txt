         Vacation is over and I'm back to work!!! It's sad coz I have to leave my kids again with their yaya. I know my kids hate the idea, too. Everytime I take a bath, Nokee goes "Mommy, work ka?" If I say "no", he smiles at me. But, if I say "yes" he will answer me "No, daddy lang work. Ayaw to work ka." He's still bulol and he mixes English and Filipino in a sentence. He is actually confuse between the two languages. Me and Clay speak to them in English but their yaya and everybody else talk to them in Filipino. That is why we are so eager to enroll him for the coming school year... we want him to be with more people who would talk to him in English. We want our kids to be really good in communication.      Genevieve Amador's 28 year old-brother died few days ago. Eloi, Mhyke, Joeben and Cel went to my place to pick me up but I wasnt able to go with them coz my kids were not feeling well and I had to take care of them. I called Eloi the day after that, she told me that they had a great time with the boys (Elmer Dimayuga, Chris Caylan, Lou Natanawan, Mike Santuile and Joeben Yap). They just played billiards after going to the wake. They are planning to go out gain this coming Friday. Im really hoping things will go well at home so I can go out.
