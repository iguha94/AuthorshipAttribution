260 dollar cell phone bill paid off.  Looks like the upheaval of moving and being dependent on its use lead me to ring it up pretty bad.  But since I FINALLY got my long-awaited check from the insurance company, I can hardly complain about the expense.  So long as it doesn’t happen again.  Bills, bills, and more bills.  Sending out fat checks to creditors, both banks and friends who I’ve lagged on paying back.  Feels fantastic not to be behind anymore.  It’ll feel even better when I have a reasonable savings account balance built up.  When’s that settlement going to come?  A place to live.  And not just mooching off the good nature of friends and family.  Although I suppose you could still call it that.  My parents decided on a condo this weekend, a brand new place near school out here in San Marcos.  Being so close by will surely bolster my academic profile.  Made the dean’s list last semester.  Would be a shame not to repeat that.  I think the place will be ready in August or early September.  I can’t wait to attack Ikea for good ol’ cheap-ass shit.  Two more class meetings before the end of the first summer session.  Three days off and then another two classes start.  Can I manage two at a time?  So much reading and paper writing.  Then again, I’ll be that much closer to finishing having knocked out nine units over break.  I’m a little out of my head as far as my ability to put thoughts down onto paper.  I hope that subsides as I get more and more used to all this medication.  Got a class to attend in a few, then to home to work on a paper with a Thursday deadline.  I’d planned to go out for dinner tonight, but that cell phone bill put me out of the mood.
