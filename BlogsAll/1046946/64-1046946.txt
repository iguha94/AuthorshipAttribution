A nasty case of vertigo for the third day now keeping me from being too present for my classes or the time away from school.  I’m not sure what it’s from save the chemical exposure I’m surely having with all the “new materials” in the ol’ homestead.  Flashing back to the film SAFE with Julianne Moore wondering if it’s that new couch (not yet arrived, but you’d remember that scene from the film) that has me losing my balance.  So here I am, awaiting the third class of the day, doing my reading in between each, then rushing home to be there for various construction workers to come in and tie up loose ends.  Today it was the garage.  Letting wittle mice into the place.  I set a trap last night, and when I awoke saw the little light blinking to signal a kill.  But the thing was empty.  Either one got away with a good shock to send it scurrying, or the thing went off in error.  Who knows.  At least there’re no new poops in my kitchen.  So it’s Friday that I’ll be hooked up again.  Of course, I won’t be home that night to write and post.  Going out with the queers on campus to a film screening at Outfest in Hillcrest, an event I’m coordinating.  Sure hope my energy picks up and I can manage the long drive down there in Friday traffic.  I came out to my neighbours last night.  Yesterday afternoon, really.  My old flame Kerri Lou was on her way out, smokin’ hot in her motorcycle gear to dress up her fat ride.  We kissed each other goodbye, a kiss that ended up a bit more extended than the last.  A little bit of tugging at clothes to punctuate the moment.  Glancing up in between episodes, I see my neighbours getting situated to leave.  The two of us in plain view.  Not a big deal, I know.  But still, the moment was weighted for me.  Still trying to realize that I no longer live at home under my parents’ stronghold over my behaviour.  When will that subside, I wonder.  Best get off the prof’s computer and post this before she comes in and I’m in the way.   stair
