I must be getting older because of what I’m about to say…  Why can’t people take responsibility for themselves?  It’s really simple – it sometimes involves raking in the praise for a good deed, and yet other times it involves a simple issuance of apology.  Hell, I apologise for other people all the time!  It’s easy, and it makes stuff roll along much smoother.  Just ask Matt, our fearless leader of the school’s LGBT group.  Now, I’ve removed my email address from the listserv because of my dramatic tendency to shut down completely in the face of hurt feelings (under the cover of seething anger).  This message reached me by way of another group member who forwarded it to me.  in brief, Matt sought to exonerate all parties from responsibility for Saturday night’s incident of multiple no-shows at the end-of-the-semester night out.  “No one is to blame” repeated twice for emphasis.  Which, as president, sounds really nice, and I know he means well to say such a thing.  Would anyone like to jump in here and tell me why this doesn’t sit well with me?  Correct!  How about letting those of us who were sitting around, stood-up like idiots, grant the reprieves?  Let those people feel the effects of their failure to commit to the plans they made.  It isn’t comfortable to hurt peoples’ feelings.  Nor should it be.  There are no consequences if the matter is dismissed like this.  I think it’s crap.  But since I’m no longer a part of the group, I suppose it’s not of my concern how they choose to move on from here.    Thing is, part of me thinks I really do need this group to get by.  But I can’t stand for more disappointment.  Which is, in itself, a disappointment.  It’s just simpler to need and willingly go without it than it is to need and have it withheld. No, it’s not logical, is it?
