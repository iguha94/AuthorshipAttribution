I’ve got another few minutes before the Simpsons episode comes on, so I’m watching Rivera fill in for O’Reilly.    But what I’m really doing is trying to figure out what to do with myself tonight and this weekend.  Yes, the tattoo buzz is getting to me.  I know what I want; I’m just searching for an interesting drawing of it.  A labrys.  An ancient minoan symbol of feminine power.  It’s a little overused, true.  But still, the weapon’s symbology came from the butterfly along with the association of transformation.  I think of it as a fitting counterpart to my ankle tattoo.  I’m thinking about it.  Wonder if I can find someone to come out and watch me do it.  The last tattoo I got, I did it alone.  No one to go with me, and I really wanted some pain sanctioned by at least one fragment of society.  My body and its markings have been in my head in a new way in past weeks.  I thought about doing what I’d originally intended with my star tattoo and fill it in with wild colours.  But this afternoon… I need balance on my bod.    Wanda Sykes!  On O’Reilly!!  I love her!!  She used to work for the NSA?!!  Holy crap!  Wonders never cease.  She’s cute.  “I’d recognise that toosh anywhere!”  Dumb comment about transgenders by Bill.  What a jackass.  I need to get out and do something tonight.  I think I can drum up some support to get something done with ink and an angry needle.  I want it on my foot.  Will they do it?  I know where I want to go…      but it looks lie a night with luis and robin at her house will suffice.  she lives on ariane!!  the neighbourhood i grew up in!!  luis asks me, "do you know the area?"  i screamed my yes.  my little childhood will be evoked all night long.  lovely... i should go.  lucky me i just stopped off for a 30/bottle of alexander valley cabernet.  perfect.  as soon as i finish the one i started a couple of hours ago.  cheers, y'all.  would only be better if kerri was with me.
