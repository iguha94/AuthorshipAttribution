I did something bad tonight.  No, I didn’t kidnap a beautiful maiden and force her to talk dirty to me in an English dialect.  But it’s not yet 10pm, is it.  I still have time…  I took a drive.  Partly to get a chance to breathe, and to have a chance to breathe in cancer-stick fumes.  But after I was out, I felt I had to have a destination.  Then my project that began a couple of days ago came back to me.  I need addresses for postcards.  And who must I send one to?  You guessed it.  Ok, so I sent Claudia one from Italy, so this isn’t a huge stretch for your imaginations.  But I’d conveniently forgotten her address… so I did a drive-by.  The only time I can do this is at night, hopefully when all the family is already home and tucked away inside, away from view of passing traffic.  Like me, doing a U-ey in their cul-de-sac.  Writing the numbers down a block away in a book I happen to be reading, the only paper I could find, sitting shotgun in my car.  I know it’s a questionable decision to mail her a postcard.  Or to even have her mailing address written down.  But you know…   it’s never over.  Should I send one to Sharon, Sally, Torril, Tatiana, Kerri, Julia, Tamara, Anna, etc…  ok, Anna is one I expect to send one to.  But she’s thousands of miles away.  And therefore safe.  Like Claudia will be for the time I’m in Barbados.  Or was in Italy.  See?  I plan these things out.  Bad, bad girl.  Yet this cute bucket hat and pigtails makes me look so… so… innocent.  Ok.  Scratch that.  All clear.  Proceed.
