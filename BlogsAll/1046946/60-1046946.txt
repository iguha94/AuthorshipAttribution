A healing afternoon spent with the fabulously sexy Kerri-Lou.  She wanted to take me out for my birthday, go down to Hillcrest and see a movie.  So we decided on Thirteen, a film about the hell of early adolescence with the beautiful Holly Hunter as mom.  Pretty rough film complete with drug use, cutting, and a shaky, grainy film style that made my head spin at times.  The cutting was a bit hard to watch… and the scene where mom finally finds out about what her young one has been up to.  The end of the film had me in tears, but since the two of us were cuddled up together throughout the movie, it felt safe to experience.  Kerri held my head and stroked my face and mouth.  So sweet of her to comfort me.  so nice to have a chance to be comforted.  God, I’m still so attracted to that woman.  Even after all that we’ve been through together.  I met her when I was just a babe of seventeen.  Took one look at her and knew who I wanted to spend my weekend with.  Manic and quirky and so charismatic, I clicked with her immediately.  We were talking about that today before the movie, how we became instantly close friends from the very first moment we met.  Too bad it ended so tragically, both of our respective addictions taking the reigns and (thankfully) pulling us apart.  She left town.  And I hadn’t seen her in six years (her length of sobriety now) until the chance meeting at the GLBT Pride Parade a month or so ago.  She still smells the same.  The old familiar perfume of a past lover.  She’s 41 now and still as sexy as ever.  A friendly kiss on the lips as we parted sums it up; I adore her.  She’s much easier to love without the needles.  It’s about time to run out to Japengo for dinner.  I’d better get dressed.
