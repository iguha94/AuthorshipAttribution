Nightly Simpsons episode to ease the stress right out of me.  Not that the day was much of a stress.  Just did homework and hit the gym for an extra long workout.  And IMed Amy for a while, collaborating with schedules and information trying to book a cheap flight to Barbados.  Guess what!  We got me one!  Itinerary as follows:  2:30am Tuesday, August 19th.               Leave my house for LAX. 7:40am				Flight to Miami. 8:45pm				Arrive on the island.  I’ll be a long day, but since I enjoy plane travel so much, it won’t be a bother.  And lord, I’ve got Amy to look forward to!  And the sun and sand of a cute little tropical island for days and days!  I don’t come home until the 28th!!  Hooray for holidays!  And hooray for exercise to tone the bod in time for several days in a bikini.  Got to keep up the shape in case there will be fuckables on the island.  I’ve my priorities in order, you betcha.  Wandered downstairs for a glass of wine tonight only to be sucked into the yelling-at-the-telly session with mom and dad.  Outraged as usual at the network news editorials that colour the presentation of the stories.  Commentary so obviously slanted, I can’t believe folks trust these heads.  My dad’s right… either state your bias or can the adjectives.  Watching this shit frustrates me.
