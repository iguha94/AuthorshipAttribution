Oh boy, oh boy.  Nothing like going out to a killer restaurant with the whole family where I can actually order sushi and no one in our party will complain about the offerings!  I’m still baffled by the lack of interest my fam seems to have for raw fish.  I could eat hamachi for every meal if somehow I could afford to.  But cheer up!  Going with the family means I don’t have to take out a loan to pay the bill!    Cafe Japengo! Check out the bounty!  A somewhat productive day reading up on the boys, Plato, Longinus, and Plotinus.  Sketched out my paper in a skeleton of evidence from their respective works.  All I have to do tomorrow is add some meat to it.  No problem.  It’s that disengaged-voice kind of writing that’s so easy to whip out in a short time.  Even if the ideas are a bit intellectual.    But for now, I cast the books aside, even the Jared Diamond I snuck in for fun, and prepare for an afternoon of gluttony to rival all others.  Luis and Chris are organising a champagne BBQ at the Weez’ house.  I’ve marinated a boat load of tiger shrimp in a light terriaki sauce to later be coated in sesame seeds and skewered along with pearl onions for BBQ bliss.  Simple, but fantastico.  The more involved I get in honing my abilities in the kitchen, the more value I place on simplicity and freshness of ingredients when grading my creations.  Luis is making some puff pastry meat concoction and assorted nibblies to snack on.  Grazing on light bits of flavour is where it’s at.   Now it’s time to create a bit of a mixed CD to fuel my fire on the way down there.  C drive, don’t fail me now.
