This is such a terrible day.  Three fires from Escondido to the border… seems to have converged in at least this mind as one big front.  I just received word from my prof, Martha, that the school will more than likely be closed tomorrow.  I mourn for lost lives.  Strangely, I’m more concerned with the furry little animals and frogs and such that have surely perished.    Poway is being evacuated now.  The fire went north into that neighborhood.  So many people living out there.  I want to cast out an offering to let someone from these places to come to my house to sleep.  So many people displaced.    So I offered to Kerri and her mom.  They can see the fire from their house, soon (I think) to be evacuated.  I just want to help; I can’t stand thinking I’m helpless and with that the folks I love.  It’s getting brighter, and I’m eagerly insisting they come on over.  I’ll even go over there and lend my car to their packing.  I just want to help.    I wonder how all my other loves are doing.  All these other friends of mine in the county that stand in the line of the fire.  Dozens.    I need to eat something to keep awake.  Hopefully it won’t put me to sleep.  If it does, god knows I’ll have the phone on next to my pillow.
