Frustrating waste of time!  Online searches of “self-inflicted violence” in hope of finding a listing of therapists who specialise in the disorder.  Tracy Alderman rules the kingdom (and lives in SD!), but I can’t seem to find any contact information for her – afraid this is because she no longer takes on patients.  Just writes books and consults.  I left a message with another woman who I see co-wrote another book with her on dissociative identity disorder, hoping that maybe either she can help me or point me in the right direction.    Why can’t anyone help me?!  Silly people not calling me back – like Karen who dumped me in the first place.  She said she had another name in mind and was going to call her and then call me about it.  A week later, I still hadn’t heard anything back from her, even with a call from me to follow up on it.  All the names on the list of references given to me by Jill, the last therapist to pass me on, ended up to be dead-ends.  And then even Sherri Kaplan, my mom’s tennis friend who’s also a therapist, gave me a couple of names… either no longer practising or no longer taking new patients.    Nothing, nothing, nothing.  Eyeing my scars and wishing I could cut again without it showing.  Alcohol blunting the focus, buying me time until I can figure something out.  I feel awful.
