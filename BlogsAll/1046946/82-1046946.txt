Doing what I can to prepare for the week.  Homework is minimal, but the reading load is daunting.  Epic poetry is too laden with names and obscure references to mythology to keep it from going by at any reasonable pace.  Then there’s the middle English of Chaucer slowing me down further.  Luckily I have a translation in my copy of the tales to expedite my getting it.  I got a call a little while ago from K.  still at work, about to finish up a 17 hour shift.  Plans to see each other maybe Tuesday night, maybe not until Wednesday late.  The perfumed bear she gave to me lost his scent.  All the more reason for me to make sure I get to see her again soon.  She’s become the bright spot to my life these past weeks.  Loving and being loved freely.  I miss every inch of her.  I think I’m going to take Trevor out to dinner tonight.  If I can tear him away from the PS2.  that game is fascinating, yes.  But he needs to get a little homework done and still have time for a good night’s rest to make up for the cold her caught late last week.  Yes, we both have it.  Both sound like it’ll be gone by tomorrow.  I can’t wait to feel better.  I can’t wait to be back in my own bed and to share it with Kerri.  And to get back into my schedule of school and workouts and all the little things that make up a normal day.  As lovely as it is being with the boy, I need to do my own thing to feel completely human.
