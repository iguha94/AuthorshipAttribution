Dewd.  I didn’t realise this until today’s required reading for my literary commentary class.  The site, this blog… it’s named as homage to Woody’s  Manhattan .  Yes, I’ve said this before.  The scene is the one in the art gallery with Mary Wilke (Dianne Keaton) talking smack about the crap work that’s on display.  13 ½ minutes into the film for those keeping score.  About the steel cube on display downstairs, she says, “to me, that was brilliant.  It had a marvellous sort of negative capability.  It was perfectly integrated… the rest of the stuff was bullshit.”  “Negative Capability,” according to Keats, means the vacuum left by the auteur when creating his work, requiring the audience to supply her own judgement and conscience to determine what morals and meaning are meant to be deduced.  Or as he states the definition of negative capability to be, “when man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact & reason” (Richter 333).  The phrase/literal is clear enough, but the significance takes some teasing out of the context.    Lovely.  Nothing like formal education to bleed over into real life.    Going out to dinner with pally-wally Chris.  Designs to hit the Spirit of Stonewall rally in Balboa Park, the precursor to the parade and festival.  But it doesn’t look like I’ll get there/have the huevos to go it alone.  I vote for beer and vittels.
