Lord, it feels like I just went to sleep!  Kerri Lou just left for work.  Had the alarm set for 4:30  knowing we’d have a little more time together this morning before she had to go off.  Dressed in a wife beater on loan from me and a pair of black work pants, I had to steal a couple more kisses before letting her leave.  Sort of in between sleep and making her coffee.  I thought I’d be off to the gym as soon as she left.  Took a shower in the dark in preparation, but now that she’s gone all I can think about is going back to bed.  So why sit here and write?  Why drink coffee when I could be back in the sheets sleeping sound?  Oh, that was quite a little experience I had with that woman last night.  Me just quaking with pleasure again and again after having her come in my mouth.  So beautiful.  Getting to watch her take a shower in front of me, this gorgeous figure clad in tattoos.  So sexy, this woman.  I’ve been smitten with her for years, yet this is the first time I’ve actually gotten to see her naked.  Lovely.  I love her smell.  I love that she’d been at work for 14 hours and I could taste it.  I love how soft her skin was after the shower when she finally slid into my bed.  I’m excited just thinking about it.  I’m inspired to workout harder this morning.  The five pounds I’ve put back on during these past weeks of woe are a bother to me.  It’s not pure vanity as much as it is a matter of how beautiful I feel, more about how I feel about it than what others perceive.  I can do better, and I shall.  Lord, kids.  I can’t believe how lovely that was.  Fan-fucking-tastic.  I was a little afraid of how this would go down before we got into it; it’s been quite some time since I’ve been with a woman.  Like, how long?  If I can’t remember quickly, it’s been too long.  Shoot!  I can only remember the boys, and those don’t even count as far as I’m concerned.          Such a stereotypical lesbian scene, the jealous cat watching us.  He tried humping her while we were downstairs on the floor earlier in the night.  Does this little thing where he lets out some cat cries and bites down on you, kind of hunkers down in his straddle.  I let him do it once to see if he’d do what the dogs so enjoy, but he seemed confused and lost himself in the moment.  Stupid neutral cat.  Maybe all my hormones are influencing him.  I did start bleeding last night.  Funny how it stops during sex until you come.  Clorox and white sheets, here I come.  Summoning Lupita, my cleaning woman alter ego.  Enough with the sordid details, yes?  Someone’s going to do some search on lesbian sex and my page will turn up.  I did need to take a pain pill to function without the sciatica ache.  Even if Kerri did give me a massage (yet as always, she goes first), my back felt like it always does.  Threatening me to be cautious.  I should have received a million in compensation just for that.  Who has the will to remain cautious?  It’s such a gyp to be handicapped.  Kerri left me toys.  Of the stuffed animal variety, nothing inspired by energizer.  I think I’ll take it upstairs for a bedmate and resume sleep.  Hit the gym in the afternoon.  I just want to get back into those sheets and smell what the two of us became.  At least until the sun comes up.
