Nothing quite like using your femininity to get revenge on creepy guys.  Sure, I don’t have window treatments yet, but does that mean I need smelly construction workers staring into my house?  It’s been happening rather consistently, so this morning I strolled downstairs wearing nothing but a smile.  Part exhibitionism, part hostility, I got one quick glance inside before a guilty face turned away.  Sometimes I feel like opening the door and confronting them.  And yes, I think my arguments have more weight when that’s all I’m putting before them.  Clothes detract from the issues.  Woke myself up this morning in my customary fashion.  A sudden jolt of panic as if I’d gone to sleep with a bomb in my bed.  This morning, it was panic about the new cat.  Wondering if it could escape or whether I killed it somehow through negligence.  Negligence, of course, from sleeping in on a weekend.  Bad girl!    No, just taking the opportunity to admonish myself for going out and drinking last night.  And for having my hands in someone’s pants during the movie.  And maybe too for footing the bill for everyone’s movie ticket (how did that happen?).    I havent’ seen the dogs all week.  And I can tell by the tone of my mood this morning that seeing them will be the only bright spot on the day.  No, I’m not a cranky pants for drinking (took a darvocet when I got up, knocking out the headache).  I’m a cranky pants for what happened yesterday.  The alcohol only helps to delay the impact of shitty things – getting yet another chance to start all over again with a new therapist.  At least this one isn’t crying in front of me to say she can’t help.  Or telling me I’ve got so much going on she doesn’t know where to start.  I just can’t believe this is continuing.  The stability factor is so low, I’m off the charts.  Time for a naked breakfast.  No clothes to remind me why this week of no working out is going to cost me more than my sputtering endorphin level.
