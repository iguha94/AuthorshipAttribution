Darned pain pill nausea punishing me for not having taken any darvocet in a couple of days.  Lucky really not to be hungover post Radiohead, but then again, I had to drive us and therefore had some limits beyond cash keeping me from knocking too many back.  Still, meds of all colours and sizes eith compounded influence of a late night/little sleep has me pretty slow to respond today.  Speaking quietly, blurred focus.  Got another class to attend before I can join my kitty on the bed, stretched out with no movement beyond a twitching nose breathing in the window’s gusts.    I knocked the ball around for a quick spell this morning.  In part for exercise, also for ego reaffirmation purposes.  I dreamt of soccer last night.  And then awoke with that dull aching in my legs and butt reminding me that my days of athletic prowess are far behind.  It hurts my back these days just trying to sit down.  A sickening feeling from the pain… that seems to have no sign of subsiding soon.  Part of me thinks just laying here on the bed with my laptop is enough for the inbetweenclass break, but I know I’m being too indulgent.  I have errands to run, poetry to read.   I can be slothful at 2:15, no sooner.  I love school.  Yet I think I’ve allowed my personal life to exhaust me to where I’m not getting as much out of my classes as I want.  Feels more like endurance than enjoyment.  What’s the point of that?
