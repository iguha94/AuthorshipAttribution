I tried making it to the gym, but it was still too early and this mysterious fluid running down my cheeks wouldn’t have looked good showing it off in public.  So I went for a little drive instead, allowing myself to be swept up in the cornyness of that Peter Gabriel song with Kate Bush “Don’t Give Up.”  Hadn’t heard it in a while, and since Kate Bush has a talent for consistently getting down in there and shaking me every time I listen to her, well… What ever happened to her?  Tori Amos stole her gig, sure.  Did they conference about it and decide there’s only room for one of them?  Did they arm wrestle for the job?  Mud wrestle?  A “devil went down to Georgia” showdown?    Man, I didn’t intend for this new blog page to fall into the same vortex of self-pity that the last one was.  I suppose I’m doing the best I can… only I have different intentions once I can get my bearings and see straight.  Busying myself with school was like wearing blinders, and now that they’re removed it’s going to take a couple of days to adjust to all the light coming in.  I didn’t quite nail that metaphor down, but I’m satisfied with it.  Hit the mark of letting myself off the hook for stumbling here, for feeling raw, stripped down.  Even though it was a strong finish at school, it’s still a loss to have something end.  Kind of like when I ran track and would vomit at the finish line.  Yet a different loss here than the gastric-contents type.  Maybe it’s about time to sit still with some tea and give the ol’ I Ching a toss.  Then maybe go back to bed and see what happens after a little more sleep.
