Lord, I’m tuckered out.  Spent two hours at the gym today – an hour on the elliptical, twenty on the bike for warm-up, 100 sit-ups, lats, arms, quads, hams… Woke up from a coma this morning thanks to Elavil.  Could hardly move.  I took one of those already tonight for dessert.  I can’t wait til it kicks in, taking with it my chance to wake up at two in the morning with excessive worry.  Got an email from Kristen.  A good sport.  She said nothing about my email.  Thank god.  Remorse isn’t good for my stomach.    Looks like I’ll be in Barbados by the 18th of this month.  Amy, bless her heart, has offered to let my plane trip be her first comp-ed airline ticket.  I can’t WAIT to get my little self into that water, to be Amy’s maid for a week, to get on a flight and out of this country for a while.  Using my passport gratifies me like few other things can.  I don’t think they let lesbians into the country, so I’ll have to find me a beautiful island man to fuck around with while I’m there.  Word on the street is that Effexor doesn’t affect your sex drive.  Lord almighty, I’m going to go on a tear!!    Emails to friends have my fingers tired of whomping away at the keyboard here.  But then again, what else am I going to do?  I’m mid-cycle with my laundry.  Can’t sleep yet even if I wanted to.  Did a little walk-through at the condo today with the folks.  Can’t tell you whether it’s going well or not or even what the hell they’re doing.  Thank Dad for understanding all the technical talk.  My mom and I just took a good look at the views, the kitchen sink/stovetop proximity to the view… really technical scrutiny.  I can’t wait.  Thankfully, I’ll have a trip to an island to help break up the waiting with something super wonderful.
