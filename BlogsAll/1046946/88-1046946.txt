Ma lord, it’s so damn hot out here today.  Weatherbug alerted me when it topped 100, kept going to 102’.  Now I see a fire on the not-so-distant horizon.  Not surprised with the weather being so dry, so unrelentingly hot.  I bought new toys for the stupid cat while at Walmart getting him more poop powder.  I think I did irreparable damage to my back picking up that 28lb bucket and carrying it to my car.  Somehow the thought of a cart at that store seemed ridiculous.  Too much crap.  The cat’s beside himself.  Anything with feathers.  He’s pretending like he’s some jungle cat with a fresh kill, staring at it with an open mouth.  But while I was in there shopping, I hear the PA system come on.  “Attention associates.  We have a fire in the toy department.”  Curious looks exchanged between customers.  One employee shouts out, “does that mean we have to leave the store?”  whatever it was, I was right next to that department, and I didn’t see anything.  Maybe it was my smokin’ bod setting off the fire alarm again.  I ought to be studying summore for my early british lit midterm for Hayton’s class.  I reread  Canterbury Tales  and  Sir Gawain and the Green Knight  this afternoon.  Now onto rereading Beowulf, the Lais of Marie de France, and the Battle of Maldon.  And any others I may be forgetting.  It’s looking like it’s going to be one hell of a test.  And bright and early in the morning to take it.  I should try to remember to invoke the muses before my coffee tomorrow.
