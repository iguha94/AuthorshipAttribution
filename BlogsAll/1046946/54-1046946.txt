Revisiting the town of iniquity tonight.  The scene of my last moral/ethical debacle.  Carlsbad, the place where Bryan lives and a part of me jumped head-long into the raging river below.  Only a couple of souls know what that means.  For them, you get the eerie significance.  Bryan had a little thing at his house tonight.  A nice night of making various California pizzas from scratch, drinking beer and wine, and listening to good music.  I walked off with a CD copy of one of my all-time fav’s, Ray Charles.  The entertainment broke up, and we went to a DVD of Amelie.  Still mourning the loss of that one in my collection, but glad that my girls in Minnesota are enjoying it.    I have to be up early for class tomorrow.  Two classes of Hayton, then a fun one with Martha Stoddard-Holmes, followed up by a later course with a new teacher I don’t know yet.  The reading list for her is 90% things I’ve read in the last two years.  The Hayton material is all I worry about.  She’s the one I’m afraid of impressing.    i could hardly speak to her the other day.  i've feared this pairing for the entire time i've been enrolled in this university.  knew i'd cower under her authority, so i dropped a class with her a couple of years ago.  guess i can't avoid her anymore.  i hope i don't fuck this up too.
