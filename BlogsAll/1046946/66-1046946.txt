I got a big laugh tonight.  Talking about Jack London's story _South of the Slot_ in my US Lit class.  So I says, "Is that a euphemism?"  Laughter ensued.  Points won.  Doing a little catch-up work this evening now that the day’s over and my back is feeling better.  Yep, I can sit up pretty comfortably.  Glad I took that extra time this afternoon to sleep some more.  Nothing works better than added rest to fix it.  Ordered a couple of things off of Amazon for gifts.  A Bill Bryson book I think my dad would get into.  And a DVD for Axia.  Hope they show up sooner than our plans to meet for dinner.  Feeling a little crappy still.  I was getting weepy in my afternoon Brit Lit class.  Another thing sleep tends to help fend off.  In truth, I should probably go back to bed now.  Yet I feel like maximising the time conscious and thinking by doing another one of my explications that’s due by Sunday night.  Yet, I know I’m not in the proper state of mind to do my best work.  I’ve got a cat, you guys.  He follows me around the house and poops in a box.  What could be so bad that this fact doesn’t offset?  Vato gato.    Now, time to do what I should have done yesterday before I wrecked my back; sit on the couch and watch tv.  Fucking relax!
