People are such IDIOTS!     Just depressed.  Thinking dark thoughts, simple things about others drawing me in with remorse for our sorry state as a species.  Wanting to see past the mundane implications of our behavior to see us as a more elevated conglomerate of significant individuals.  Looking around me at school, I see people, hear them speak to each other, and my heart sinks with despair.  I can’t hold it, and I can’t let it go.  Shallow and meaningless, all of it.    I awoke in the middle of the night in a bed I didn’t go to sleep in.  Another episode, two this week, of me getting up and moving places to sleep without remembering it.  Is it sleepwalking?  I suppose so.  Kind of unsettling to not be in control of myself while I’m asleep.  Maybe I should lock myself in my room somehow.  Am I moving to help my back, or is there something else that’s so upsetting to me that I’m trying to escape even while I’m asleep?  Did I have another nightmare that I can’t remember?  What happens when I live alone, have no one there to notice that the front door was opened in the middle of the night for a sleepwalker to make her way out into the street?  Worse than that, the dog followed me into the room and peed on the bed.  The bed with the comforter I don’t know if I can wash.  I didn’t have time this morning to augment the situation.  Just enough time to get out the door and make it to school in time for a decent parking spot.  What do I say to my mom?  Do I have to take those sleeping pills to keep me deeply asleep so that doesn’t happen?  Why do I feel guilty for what’s happening to me?  Went into the bathroom once I got here, sat down on one of the toilet seats and muffled some tears welling up inside of me.  I could hide out alone and let it out if only I had a safe place to do that.  A place to go where no one would follow me or be a witness to it.  I’m trapped in autopilot until I can construct that space.
