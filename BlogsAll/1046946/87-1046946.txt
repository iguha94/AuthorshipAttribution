What a day, what a day.  Yes, I awoke on time to get to class with my usual 30 minute buffer for proper parking options.  Then to class where I took my first ever Hayton midterm.  And you know what?  I think it went really well.  Not only did I pass it, I think I got a mid to high B.  which is saying something for her classes, yo.  We’re all afraid of her exams.    And tonight I got back a paper written for my 309B class.  American Lit, late.  Not a stellar performance at an 89%, but it’ll do for a paper I waited until the last weekend to write and never read through before submission.  I’ll kill the next paper, and there’s only two more to consider.  So I went to all my classes tonight and even spoke up on a pressing comment I had to make on Edna Pontellier in Chopin’s The Awakening.  A text I’ve read, what?  Like four times now in my literary education?  I’m sick of it.  Sick of the themes, talking about the ending, listening to peoples’ judgment of her character (or lack of).  S-i-c-k.  but I stuck it out until the bitter end while my colleagues who’ve taken the early US lit class with me this summer WHERE WE JUST READ IT were walking out bored.  And what do I come home to?  Some time with the XBOX playing RoadRage until I realized there was a World Series match on.  Tuned in just in time to see the Marlins win in the 12th.  Now I’m happy.  Tied at 2 a piece.  I feel like going out.  But where’s Kerri?  I thought she might come by tonight, but now I’m assuming she’s going to call on her way to bed.  So I’m going out to the Lane for a brew and some time alone.  I need – no, I deserve some downtime.  I did good today, god damn it.  I passed a Hayton exam.
