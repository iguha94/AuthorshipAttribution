HOO-RAY!  I'm gay too!  What am I grateful for?  One, my car didn’t get towed from an almost-red parking spot.  And two, that I was able to park it AND get it home without overheating.  Silly thing.  I saw the gauge when I got down there at 9am this morning.  Never seen my car threaten me to overheat before.  Suspect, indeed.  I’ll have to get that looked at this week.  Whilst mom and dad will help me pay for the repairs.  And what did I come away with this afternoon?  Hmmm, let’s see… I’ve got some stickers in here, about a gallon worth of lube in handy little individual packets.  Um… beer.  Got that.  Um… and a new purple vibe to substitute for the pinky that no longer hums as advertised.  Madon!  It's much more lovely than the old kitty.  Stand aside for the    new     purple bunny!    Blister potential in my little feet-sies after walking a good 5 miles+ from the parking spot to the parade to the festival and back.  Lotion lubricating the sore suckers as I type.  Hip flexors and legs aching from all the travel.    I’m a touch inebriated, or I’d write a bit more.  About all the old friends/acquaintances I ran into, all the glory of walking the parade route holding our school’s banner, hootin’ and hollerin’ at the crowd in celebration.  I think I’ll set the Tivo to local news shows tonight – see if we made it to the networks.  Lord, I need a BBQ.  Shish kabobs a la lesbian.    Or just my burrito en fuego hell.  Yup.  5-Alarm.  i'm dying here.
