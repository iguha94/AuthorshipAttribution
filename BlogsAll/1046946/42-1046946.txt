There’s this sweet boy I know from school.  His name is Terence.  Something about his disposition, his demure grace, the way he dances with so much freedom and sensuality…  well, he’s a really good soul.  Of all the new pals I’ve met through this group of ours on campus, he’s surely the most compelling character.  I might not ask him to father my children until I know him better, but the thought did cross my mind.  He likes my blog, it seems.  I hope he reads this entry soon.  You rock, Terence.  I hope we can be better friends as time unfolds.  I spent the night with Bryan having greasy pizza and cask-conditioned beers at Pizza Port in Solana Beach.  After driving him back to his car, I thought I’d stop off for a cigarette refill.  When I saw who sat outside…  An older man in a lawn chair stroking his short, peppered beard.  And a lump of blankets a few feet in front of him.  A dog, large from what I could tell, tucked beneath a pile of blankets.  Save for his little rump that stuck out unprotected.  Could have been a great dane.  I couldn’t tell by it’s toush.    But it was touching nonetheless.  This big, noble animal tucked in with blankets and sleeping without any fearful reservation.  Its hindquarters sticking out trustingly, innocently.  And a man not fully able to take care of himself, yet his pet creature lies heavily upon the concrete with enough warmth to feel overly cared for.    And with that image I take leave to join my own puppy-love in a bout of sub-lucidity bliss.  So sleepy…. The pain pills, sleeping pills, and beer must be reaching a sort of critical mass.  Time to retire.
