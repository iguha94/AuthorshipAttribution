Struggling to readjust to all that’s happening.  The word “endurance” flickering in my head over and over again like a sputtering flame.    Assaults from all sides.  Legal, financial, health, mental health… and now it’s my family.  My core support, right?  Estranged suddenly from my mother, I can’t bring myself to reengage with her and let it slide.  I’ve been doing that for nearly ten years now, allowing her to make me feel like a pariah for my sexuality, as if it’s a mark of mental dysfunction.  I could attack her, I’m so angry.  There’s no excuse for what she did to me the other night, and there’s no room to let her try again at this tender juncture with her track record for abusive comments.  I simply can’t let her near me.  too dangerous.  Still not a penny to play with.  Worries about getting a check to my therapist on Wednesday.  She doesn’t take Visa.  Which means I’ll have to ask my mom for two hundred bucks for the past two sessions.  Which means I’ll have to talk to her.  Maybe I’ll send her an email since that seemed to be an acceptable medium for her apology.  I’ll send her an invoice in reply.  Days without sunshine.  Inhospitable for beach outings.  Could use a little time on a towel.  Computer problems.  Something is wrong with it, but my brother is nowhere to be found.  Guilty about asking him again to help fix it, knowing he’s too busy as it is.  Whatever.
