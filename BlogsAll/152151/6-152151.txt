well hello there! :)  so here i am at work, dead tired!  just a recap, we went raving yesterday~ and it was pretty damn crazy. hehehe.  like we left berkeley around 7:30ish i think, and we headed for the billy graham civic auditorium, which is right in the middle of all the cultural part of SF, like the opera house and symphony place and everything. omg, parking was SUCh a bitch.  like we seriously circled for like an hour until we finally gave up and went to pay parking underneath max's opera house cafe.  pretty trippy, we found a parking lot that was full, but the guy who worked there said that for $5 we could park in the middle, just not block the other cars.  so we're like cool! but as we're about to leave, people who parked like us also tell us that that guy is a homeless bum just trying to get money out of us!  so everyone left and we still didnt have parking.    by the time we finally got through the line and inside it was like almost 10pm.  and the rave was going to end at 2!  but in those 4 hours, my gosh, it felt like 10 hours.  we went with my friend fei and her bf phil, and we met lots of people there, but u know, its always hard to remember actually.  lets see, there was sarah, and miniphil, and jenny and her bf james.  sarah is like 18! trippy huh, she's a senior in high school, wow makes me realize how innocent i was back in high school! haha.  it was miniphil's first rave yay!  jenny and james are 4th years at berkeley, they are so cute! :)  i think thats all i remember for the moment..oh and oreo! :)  then we came back to our place for a little afterparty and we were all so tired by like 5ish we all fell asleep!  but here i am at work, since 8am! i took a break at 11 to go pick up will and bring him here to keep me company and i fell asleep at home for like an hour, ahah, so much for my 15 minute break!  k k, im so tired! gonna try to take a nap! byee!
