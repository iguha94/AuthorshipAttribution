justice at last.  ack! i got a B+ in my history class!!!!!  how could that have happened! man i was totally expecting an A, at least an A-!  must have been the final..argh...but i guess B+ is still good, it'd help my GPA regardless hehe!    today i helped a friend move out of his apartment.  it was tiring yet fun :) .  even though it was crazy hot!  we're heading down to LA for the day tomorrow im going to the dentist!  hope everything is fine!  ooh i bought a kate spade laptop bag!! i'm waiting for it in the mail.  YAY!!  im so excited about it, its beautiful!!  gosh lakers HAVE to win on sunday! they must!! it was an awesome yet stressful game today, but i knew they could do it! :)  nothing too interesting is going on in my life- im on a crazy diet- plus exercise.  i want to look good in vegas! hehe.  wish me luck on that!  ok not much going on i guess, im going to go think about packing maybe..or maybe i'll just do it tomorrow morning.  we'll see.  im just worried about how hot its going to be in LA!  oh well- bring stuff with me to do i guess.  we're down for such a short time its silly- we'll be back in time for laker game on sunday for sure!    nothing juicy..byee
