today is a big day.  it is a HUGE monumental day.  serious. hope things go well today.  but i dunno, i forgot the vietnamese sandwich i had saved from yesterday at home! i was going to have it for lunch! but nono, no bad omens- honest mistake, i was just running late and trying to decide what to wear..honest mistake! not a bad omen! :)  we tried to make 2 new dishes last night, and only 1 of them turned out edible.  but thats what happens right? trial and error.  the failed one was pickled cabbage. the one we made was pretty icky...too much salt?  i have no clue- im not a cook!  ooh we have dirty dishes now, i get to use my new baby blue disneyland apron! ehe..  on the way dropping off one of our friends last night we stopped at hollywood video cuz will has these like rent up to 3 of anything for 99 cents each coupons.  thats pretty good- especially since like renting games can get expensive.  so i picked up 3 different n64 games..lately i've been itching to try out their games.  we have a n64 at work here, but mostly we just play mario kart.  the other games they have here are like weird games.  they have the supermario though, the 3D one, it looks cool but really time consuming.  so anyway, i picked out 3 games.  a powerpuff girl one, pokemon stadium2 and yoshi's story.  get home?  inside the powerpuff box is MADDEN!  football!  ack!  pretty bummy.  but the yoshis game seems pretty fun.  im still kinda clueless on how to play the pokemon stadium2.   gotta work! byee!
