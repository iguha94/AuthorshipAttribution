boy am i bummed! i got my midterm back today, the midterm that i studied SO hard for and i did so horrible! actually mostly i missed this one problem, 20 out of 75 points! like it was Such a simple problem that i thought it couldnt possibly be that easy..so i did my own thing and got some crazily wrong answer! and that 20 points killed me! ugh!  at least i can drop this midterm, which is good cuz i did well on my first one, but then that just means that i have to do well on my next one- which is going to be pretty damn hard im sure.  i seriously think i studied too hard for this midterm, like i warped my view- that problem  was so simple and here i was thinking of like complex complex ways to do it! oh well..ugh!  im feeling better now though, i was REALLY bummed earlier.  i have a new band i like- well i guess i cant really say i like them cuz i only heard one of their songs.  they're called 'linkin park' and the song i like is 'crawling'.  see ahah, i was watching mtv the other day and their video came on, and its like u know a hard rock-ish song?  so im like ok ok, no big deal, didnt really like it or anything, but didnt not not like it? so this guy is singing and stuff and theres like this part where one of the guitarist like looks into the camera and says like two lines really forcefully or something- and i dunno- from that i was hooked! ahaha he was so sexy! ahaha ok ok..strange huh.  oh i had a full weekend!  friday- we ate at isobune, saw jurassic park and then went to fentons. yum yum.  saturday we went to cobbs comedy club in sf, and sunday we went to chevys and rented wedding planner ( i had to work all day).  we've been spending too much money going out with friends, so i think we're going to try to lay low for a while- just stay home or something.   oh my best friend from high school is coming up this weekend- yay it should be fun! sucks i have to work sunday though, but at least saturday i dont have to so we'll do something crazy.    ok back to work!
