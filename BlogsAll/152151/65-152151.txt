so i got my math midterm back today! i got 99/100!  im just amazing myself!  amazing!  i have an ee midterm next week on tuesday, and a cs midterm on monday.   this past weekend seemed to go by so fast.  friday was the sisterhood sleepover which was actually alot of fun! we ended up all going to sleep really really late which was not good cuz we had icc cleanup the next morning.  we had to leave the hotel by like 715-730ish.  i had to drive which sucked even more ehe cuz i was so tired!  but it was ok i guess- even kind of fun cleaning up mission street (between 19th and 20th).  so funny- like the block we were assigned was the EXACT block i had gone to before like a couple years back with some friends trying to get a fake ID..coincidental!  anyway.  so like my back was hurting alot right? by sunday it was getting a little bit better, not much thanks to friday sleeping all funky on the hotel bed.  but anyway, we go to costco on sunday to get some food- and i end up making it worse!!  how?  well you know those little dolley things, like where you can put heavy things on them and then like wheel it somewhere else?  i have no idea what we were thinking.  will got on it, and i tried to like tilt it back right? and push him a bit?  i managed to tilt it back, but right then i realized that it was tilting a bit too back and i didnt have the strength to push it back up right!  moment of panic! i  didnt want to drop will on the floor! so somehow i managed to lower him slowly (well not that slowly) to the ground, putting immense strain on my back- like exactly where i had hurt it before.  clever huh!   i have no clue what we were thinking.  we ended up both on the floor- and at the moment it was hilarious....but not anymore! i think my back is worse than before now.  i had a cig today and it was unenjoyable.  thats good!  i think cigarettes are starting to wear off on me..  well i have LOTS of homework to do today! ttyl!
