happy new year everyone!  so I'm back up in berkeley..I'm actually glad to be home, everything back to normal..ready to start another semester of school!  I think I'm going ot have a positive outlook for this semester, instead of complaining about how hard my classes are, I'm just going to study study study, no last minute waiting!  New year resolution!  I made a few for this year- that i'm determined to stick to.  first, I'm going to be a better girlfriend- not that I'm a bad one! haha.  just going to try to be not so high maintenance u know?  also, I'm going to try to quit smoking! yup!  I dunno if I want to quit quit yet, but i'm definitely going to cut down drastically- maybe 1 a day or on certain occasions!  and three! exercise and lose weight! ehe, thats probably the hardest one! :)  we'll see though!  so for the rest of the break i'm planning on working working working- get money money money, cuz i really dont want to work when school starts- at least cut down hours drastically then.  man i'm trying to check my balance in my bank account- but bofa.com isnt working!  too much traffic!  i guess everyone is trying to see how broke they are the holidays..not me!  i didnt shop in LA at all! i'm really proud of myself for that- even with all the deals!  good job!  hmm..im going to get washed up, maybe go into work later today..anymoney is good!
