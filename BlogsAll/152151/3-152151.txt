i was talking to some friends yesterday and we were talking about how strong relationships are and stuff, and about cheating and various things like that.  and it made me wonder how my boyfriend can trust me!  cuz like when i met him, i was actually with another guy who i thought i was gonna share my life with and next thing i knew, kablooie, i plan on sharing my life with will.  so how can he feel sure that its not going to happen again?  cuz its not!!  this girl i know, is supposedly in a really intense relationship, like they plan on getting married and stuff even though they've only been together for like a year or so.  but the other day, we were hanging out, and she was calling this guy who was supposedly just a friend, but she was like all nervous before calling him, like asking, oh does my voice sound ok?..and stuff like that.  and it made me wonder, wtf u know? like if you're so happy with someone why would you care about trying to impress some random guy..so i have doubts about how long that relationship is going to last..  but anyway, back to will and me.  i totally trust him and i have no doubt he totally trusts me.  like as a couple we've really grown so much in 2 and a half years.  like before i think we were both crazy jealous or protective and stuff, (ehee, there's this girl, one of his co-workers- that i'd LOVE to see face to face...) and like by now, i tease him about other girls, but i dont think i'm actually worried about losing him or him losing me.  we're just an old married couple. :)   ok back to work..byeee!
