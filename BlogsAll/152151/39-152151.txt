whoohoo first day of school over!  well the day isnt exactly over cuz im still at work.  but its a sacrifice i decided to make myself.  i'm going to close for the rest of week- wed, thur AND friday!  amazing huh!  but i figured that i really have no interest in going to any of the rush events and the percentage chance that i'd actually be interested in going to a rush party are extremely tiny, so i might as well and work to make $$ to pay off all my damn bills.  paycheck isnt for another 2 weeks though..i can rough it!   i think that im going to start helping will out with the rent in march.  cuz i need the money for february, but def. hopefully by march.  whew.  its going to be nice to pay off bills.  and u know what?  february isnt even that far away! its already the 22nd! so like only over a week!  yay!  ooh we went boarding on sunday to sierra with friends.  it was a lot of fun!  my poor calve muscles were really sore though..i think we're going to go again this weekend to kirkwood. yay!  i guess like the weird part of the weekend was that like the people who rode with us in the car there didnt offer to help with gas!  i dunno, like i guess im used to being around people who know to offer and stuff u know?  and it definitely surprised me that they didnt offer.  i dunno, its not that like its so much money u know? its just the whole being considerate thing u know?...oh well....  yay its almost 9! that means will's going to be done playing golf soon and head over here.  im going to trick myself into not hating working at night because its just for this week.  only this week!  and plus i need the money so i can brainwash myself into accepting that its a good idea.  i'd probably be at home watching tv and vegging out anyway- exactly what im doing here.  i dont even think i've gotten a phone call since like 6:30...  ok..im going to try to entertain myself some more...byeeee!
