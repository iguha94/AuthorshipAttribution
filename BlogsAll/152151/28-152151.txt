yay at work. this sucks. i need to study. ooh i had a dream last night that i was in vegas with a bunch of people, and me and shirley? were trying to find our way back to our hotel room, but we were getting kind of lost- and then i thought i saw jet li dressed in a blue shirt go into a room so i was like ooh! so we followed, but turned out that guy wasnt him- BUT jet li was there like lying in bed on the phone! and we were like..!!  but then he was like i really do not feel like having visitors right now..and we were like but..and he was like.. REALLY..so we left. strange eh?  i guess watching the one last night did have some effect on me afterall.  i dont think it was that bad! and his english has improved alot!    im a little annoyed at will right now.  like often on sundays he always says that hes going to come to work with me- like and just hang out with me- they have this really comfortable chair here thats great to nap in.  and then the next morning when its time to go he's always like..ehh..he doesnt want to get out of bed. its not like a big deal if he doesnt come with me but i just get annoyed when he says he will but he doesnt.    oh well. i really need to study today. gotta go byee!
