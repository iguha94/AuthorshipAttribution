next final tomorrow morning!!! ackkk!!!  i think if i study my ass off tonight i should do ok ..not terrifict though!  im starting to panic about my friday night final...which is not good cuz i need to save my panicking for my tomorrows final and get that done with before i can allocate all my panicking-ness to my cs final on friday...not enough panic to go around! hehee.  yay we had curry tonight again.  we had it last night too.  i dunno what it is about curry..all of a sudden i really like it! but theres really no reason.  its simple and just rice with sauce!  little things can make me happy.  but also big things too. hehe.  vegas is less than 2 months away! yay!  so this weekend should be nice because im done with school for the semester! yay!  next weekend we're heading down to LA i think but not for sure, and the weekend after that we're going to a wedding!  then the weekend after that- its only 1 month till vegas! i enjoy vegas- yay!  gambling gambling gambling!  i found this really cool website today about how to tell if a kate spade bag is fake or not.  it was really helpful!  amazing how many fakes there are out there.  did u know its illegal to sell fake merchandise- regardless if the person knows its fake or not- its like violating some copyright infringement or something..and its against the rules to do so on Ebay too~ you'd think they stop people from doing so- the site said that like fakes to real kate spade items are like 6 to 1.  fakes suck! i hate them! ahah.    oih my tummy hurts, must be from the panicking! hehe.  9 more hours till my final.  i dont think im going to sleep tonight- im going to try not to anyway, but i probably will- must go  study! i cant believe its 11 already! kkk be back tomorrow after my final! wish me luck! PLEASE GOD!! :) byee!
