u know, the color of this blogger is starting to get to me.  im a big fan of blue..but eh- i dont know about this color anymore. hehe.  ok big plans today! NOTHING! hehehe.  well not nothing.  but it still rounds up to be about nothing.  we saw insomnia last night- i wouldnt say the movie sucked? but it wasn't THAT great...i cant wait to watch bourne identity!  kareen wants to watch spirit and will wants to watch undercover brother. haha.  yay my summer has started! i have one month like almost exactly to make the most out of it! :)  lakers lost last night.  it was VERY VERY sad.  they HAVE to beat the kings they must they must they must! i dont know why i get so stressed out over basketball haha, i just love the lakers!  i think i like them so much because they're soo....unGhetto?  ahah yeah i think thats it.  almost all of their players are like decent and well spoken (except shaq..hehe..but his skills make up for it!).  they MUST MUST win!!  i'll keep my fingers crossed till friday!  i had the funkiest dream last night.  will wanted to get with this girl we knew cuz she was skinnier and had bigger boobs than me.  isnt that strange!  and something about my friend's wedding or something.  yah i forget.   oh my cousin is getting married in september!  how exciting- so fast! my mom says its because her fiance is a navy seal (WOWWW!!) and he's getting shipped off overseas.  that must be harsh though, like getting married and having ur husband leave- maybe my cousin will go with him? i have no idea.  my mom says they're getting married up here- like in some really really popular getting-married-at park up here- my dad is coming up and taking me and my sister i think.  no dates allowed for us! but thats ok- its not like its a friend's wedding u know?  my mom was saying that me and will should get engaged after i graduate- but i still think its too early.  i'll be only 22!  thats just too young for me.  we'll just let time take its flow.
