finally its friday!!!  FINALLY!  i dont think i've ever been so happy for a week to be over.  this week has majorly sucked bigtime!  my two midterms at the beginning of the week- one i didnt do great on and the other one i dont know yet but im not going to hold my breath.  plus i didnt go to both of my math discussions cuz 1) i was studying for my midterms and 2) i was just too damn tired from studying for my midterms.  plus my ee lab was so horrible and frustrating!  the only high points was me actually finishing my cs homework this week! and also actually understanding the cs lab. yay!  today.  class till 10..i love fridays.  i kind of want to go shopping, but i really shouldnt until i have my laptop paid off.  im planning on getting a pedicure today though.  plus we're going to see scorpion king tonight! yay!  tomorrow night i have to go to berkeley lambda installs in SF..joy.. i need the external points!!  oh well- even though its the weekend- i should probably keep up with my studying. it sucks to fall behind!  yesterday was me and wills 3 year 7 months anniversary..not really an anniversary but you know what i mean.  we're getting old! hehe.  but its ok cuz we're very much in love u know?  like u know how sometimes couples just get sick of each other over time? not us! :)  i think our biggest obstacle in our relationship is my passion for shopping! ahaha.  ok i gotta head to class be back later!
