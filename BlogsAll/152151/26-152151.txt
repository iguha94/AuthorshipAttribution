i need to get more rested sleep.  i swear- like every night i have like vivid dreams- and i wake up feeling still tired.  like last night- i had a dream that i was like in this fighting arena- against 3 other guys. and we all weapons.  and we were throwing knives at each other and everything, and i accidently cut my own finger a little bit so i called a time out to get a bandage.  yeah- so it was a pretty stressful dream- dodging knives and blocking swords.    saw harry potter last night.  i was SOOOOO excited!  but i was so tired too! it was good!!  its been so long since i've read the books though haha, i was like- oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah i remember!  its nice :).  i think today is going to be a no carb day.  im going to try! hehe.  formals are like in 2 weeks- yikes!  i havent even thought about what im going to wear.  ooh- will's making the fish filet tonight. yum yum yum.  im a big steamed fish fan- and i like the bbq chicken he makes. hehe.    not sure what im going to do at work tonight- i do not feel like studying- but maybe i will- some light studying.  i still want to sleep. Zzzzz.  maybe do some early christmas shopping. haha just kidding.  at least look around online for ideas though.    okok..byee!
