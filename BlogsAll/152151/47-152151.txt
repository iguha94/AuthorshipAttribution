good morning!!  back at work..  i wanted to put in here my dream that i had wednesday night..its kinda shady now..but its one of those dreams that are just soo strange!  but since it is friday already its not as clear as it was yesterday. basically i was trying to save the statue of liberty! and i was with that huge guy from 'the green mile' or something, and then i was trying to run away from bad ninja guys and i could turn myself invisible..weird action dream..usually will has those, not me..  anyway.  i worked an 8-10 shift..8am to 10pm shift that is yesterday.  crazy huh! i dont know if i ever want to do one of those again!  it was harsh!  but lets see..thats 13 hours (with an hour lunch), so i get paid for 8 and then 5 hours overtime! yay!  today im here 8-4..so thats another 8 hours. yay.  i brought my gameboy advance with me today too.  for some reason, yesterday, everytime i tried to play it or read my harry potter book i kept dozing off..strange...  i am DETERMINED not to get a ticket for my car today.  i got here around 830, so i should definitely go check/move my car at 10:30..damn tickets.  i might go snowboarding on sunday!!  i dunno how excited i am though, haha, im so out of shape i feel, im going to be so sore!  my brother has a layover at SFO tomorrow, which is cool, so we're going to pick him up and have lunch or something..his layover is 9-2 though! 9am! thats so early in the morning!  and since its an international flight he's going to be catching, he probably has to be there at like 12 to check in, so thats like only a 3 hour difference.    what should i do today.  hmm. i have magazines to read. i have my pokemon crystal.  there is a n64 here- they have supermario- i played it for a bit yesterday- its pretty cool! so cute! kind of want a n64, but will says theres really no point cuz its going to be antiquated soon...but it has so many pokemon games!!  oh well..hopefully the gamecube will develop lots!  im bored. ahahahaah. lovely!
