yay 5 minutes till im off work.  just thought i'd drop by real fast.  i suck at mario kart! im so bad at it!  but im trying not to give up.  we play when we're at work so its pretty fun here.  going to costco/99 ranch today!  gonna buy much needed food...i usually stock up on shampoo/conditioner when im there but i dont think i need to this time- my hair feels so short!  but im getting used to it..it feels so much lighter and healthier than long long hair.  what are we going to do tonight..i dunno.  kareen and some people are going to vegas in april.  i want to go to vegas, but we just went a few months back.  plus like its only fun if you go with people who are like in the same budget group you know?  like when me and will go we spend money like crazy, doing lots of gambling and stuff.  i dont think kareen and them will be that loose with their money anyway.  i guess since we just went to vegas, we should try somewhere new next time.  i really dont know- maybe new york.  but i dont really know anyone there we could stay with. actually- my uncle lives there, i really like this uncle he's my favorite uncle- i think he'd be happy to have us.  we'll see. but a trip like that takes lots of planning and money..and im still paying off bills hehe..so much for lots of money! but maybe in the summer or spring break or something. it should be fun!  ok im off! byee!
