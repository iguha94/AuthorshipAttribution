man it is raining HARD!  which is good cuz that means MORE SNOW in tahoe!! but alas, its only wednesday night and the weekend is so far away.  i was actually contemplating ditching formals this weekend and just heading up to tahoe on friday...but then i realized that i have to work on the calbot this weekend with dave cuz the competition is monday!  wish us luck!  im really excited bout it actually, so excited im actually going to tell you about it!  dave's doing all the coding mostly cuz im pretty confused with that stuff, but im doing all the wiring! isnt that exciting! yes yes, wiring isnt THAT hard, but just the process of me doing it is pretty exciting to me!  we have lots of plans for our little bot, its going to be a 'search and rescue' kind of robot. :) isnt that nice- its got a good purpose!  we're using sonar and infrared sensors and mikes and lights and a little broadcast camera!  i'll keep u posted on that!  im SUCH a procrastinator.  i have a quiz tomorrow, and i've been playing this damn computer game online. its at www.real.com/games/webgames/ .  its called infest or something, like pretty much i have to build these walls to keep these aliens from attacking my little guys.  it keeps crashing my computer, yet i continue to play...some satisfaction in saving those little guys i guess! haha.  ooh my pledgesis nancy won for president of our sorority next semester! im really happy for her, and excited!  that may probably be the one thing that could actually convince me to go back active next semester..we'll see..  !! it stopped raining!  nono! keep raining!! wash my car!!
