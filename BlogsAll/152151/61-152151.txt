where to start my studying!  no where! hehe.  so somehow..i dunno how..i got convinced into buying makeup from yves saint lauren yesterday. YSL.  i dunno how you spell it.  but the guy (obviously gay) was so convincing that i decided to return all the other stuff i had boughten from like clinique and stuff and go with ysl.  cost me like 3 times as much..but we'll see..oh well!  so last night we went sake bombing- it was actually kinda fun.  im not a big fan of beer, so the aftertaste was kinda gross, but at least it wasnt like a vodka shot aftertaste u know?  my friend from LA is up this weekend- i think they're going to go clubbing tonight but i dunno if i want to go- like i really want to hang out with her and stuff cuz i never see her and all- but i am really not a clubber- like i can say that i almost detest clubbing as much as i hate mushrooms and tofu.  its a very strong feeling.  but oh well- maybe if they dont go clubbing we'll be able to hang out.  ooh i got a 90/100 on my math midterm! wow huh!  like getting a score like that makes me feel like im back in high school again. hehe.  so i was all happy- and then i got my cs grade back. KABLOOIEEE...any happiness is long gone.  but ohwell- that just means i gotta work harder- and with my laptop coming- i will be able to!! yay!!  ok i really should do some studying then..heres my order:  math- do the reading and homework...then ee- catch up on reading? look over previous homeworks (midterm on thursday), then watch the last 2 lectures for CS and look at homework!  thats my plan!! i have 1.5 hours!  then us and christians are going to go watch we were soldiers.  byee!!
