whew two midterms down!  i swear these classes are really driving me nuts, sometimes i feel im just not smart enough! like serious! i study study study, well maybe not study as much as i should, but theres always that one damn problem on the midterm that makes me feel completely stupid! oh well..i hope i did ok..  im not getting enough sleep..i should go take a nap.  yay, july 16th!  lets see..ooh..2 days until lets see..2 years 10 months anniversary? yeah something like that..heheee..whew its been a long time.  like i was talking to one of my friends about it the other day, me and will have been together for like an amazingly long amount of time. of course like in the wider perceptive, 3 years isnt that long, but for like college aged people?  like when we got together, like lots of other couples were getting together too, and i dont really know any of them that are still together! like sure, theres this girl i know i think she's been with her bf for like gosh knows how long, but like shes cheated on him numerous times, so like, i dont think that really counts.  but yeah anyway, like i remember like all these couples that were around at some point in time and now they're all broken up.  i guess i'm just really lucky to have found the one while others just keep looking and looking.  i went bowling this past weekend- i have never bowled so horribly in my life. seriously, i think it was the pressure of guys against girls.  it was pretty bad, i gave up at the end and just started studying my eecs stuff- whatta nerd huh! ehehe, you'd think i would have done well on my midterm today! sheesh- damn load lines!  actually there was a problem on there that was so unfamiliar to me that it was crazy- like it was with inductors in functions of time- i dont remember ever having to do a problem like that- and if you read a problem and u dont even understand what its asking, u know ur pretty screwed.  well well will is on his way home, better do some cleaning..heehee.. bye!
