vegas is less than 2 weeks away!!! yay!!  we saw the powerpuff girls movie tonight..i dunno..im a huge fan..but this movie was soo....dark!  like i wanted it to be more light hearted and cute..but it got pretty serious and very ..DARK..at some parts.  oh well.  afterwards we headed over to diamo in el cerrito.  i had told kareen about this dessert they have there- its like tapioca in coconut milk with honeydew.  its REALLY good.  we got there like a bit after 9 and we had to wait a while to get a table.  it was pretty packed!  mojo is a very different kitty now.  sushi's been gone for a little more than a day and he's completely changed.  we returned sushi yesterday morning..it was pretty tough.  she was so cute!  then afterwards we went to the pet food express store in pinole (yah there is one in berkeley but we already scoped it out last weekend).  we had a 20% coupon off and we still ended up spending like 200 bucks.  lets just say mojo is going to be a very very spoiled kitty.  last night he even slept in bed with us! hehe. he's so cute.  he's so much more social now, like he'll actually come find us and kittynap with us.  before u come near him he'll run away just like that.  my little mojo. :)  its going to be a tough week.  eck.  cs cs cs.  hopefully i'll be able to hack it.  by the time thursday comes around (cs midterm) it'll be only 1 week till vegas so it should help me get through these agonizing times! haha.  ooh we're going bowling on saturday!  yup!  i gotta see if i have time to actually make the reservation at albany bowl for the 'bowling party' that will won.  it should be fun. :)  i really suck at bowling though- but hey i cant be good at everything!  hm..going to maybe do some reading..or just go to bed..we'll see! 99!
