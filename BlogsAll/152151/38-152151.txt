so like i had the weirdest dream last night!  it was really strange- like in it will and i had broken up for some weird reason- and then i was like back home and i was watching old videos, and some of the videos had like taped tv news programs that had been about me and my ex breaking up.  isnt that strange?  oh well.  i just thought it was really odd.  and there was something in there about a breakfast buffet place, but they were almost out of food because it was almost past breakfast and i was complaining that i wanted another piece of pancake cuz they had cut them into like pizza slices and the slice they gave me was really small, but they said only one per person, so i pretended to be like 'oh hey will-i'll get one for you' even though i wasnt going to give it to him.  something strange like that.  something fishy is going on..im not too clear though.. u know how like something strange is going on but u dont want to accept it and u just keep trying to convince urself that there has to be an explanation behind it?...well hopefully this fishy thing has an explanation behind it...we will soon find out!  i have lab at 8pm tonight.  fun.  i hope i dont feel too entirely clueless.  oh no! theres a new friends on tonight! i dont want to miss it! hopefully i can get will to record it for me..he's not allowed to play golf today eheh, cuz i need a ride to lab- all the way at soda!  oh i think theres a rush even tonight too, hopefully it will go well.  ok ok. back to work!
