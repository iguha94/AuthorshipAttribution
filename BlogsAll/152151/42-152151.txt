yawn..still so sleepy!  ooh friday was a GREAT day.   hm yesterday we went to this place called sonic?  its like in jtown on top of dennys.  i guess its a thai karaoke bar but seriously like the only people thai there were the people who worked there! mostly it was like cantonese people.  we went to meet up with fei and her friend cindy there.  and we bumped into henry!  so coincidental!  henry is this like OLD school paphi, like i met him back when I was a freshman.  Like i had totally forgotten but Henry was there the night that i met will!  like the night of my sopi presents, like there were 14 of us pledges and like 13 of the paphi ones, so we we short one to escort one of us down the walkway or whatever?  so i ended up getting escorted by henry! ahah yup i was very cool, i had a ACTIVE escort me and not a pledge. haha. jk.  anyway like bla bla bla afterwards we went to lyons then music box.  and like so trippy that night, i have a picture of me and will right?  like its special to me because its the very first night we met..and hilariously i totally forgot- like in the picture im in the middle and will is on one side and henry is on the other!  its actually on my website!  trippy trippy trippy.  anyway, hanging out with fei and cindy was pretty fun.  like i see fei so unoften cuz she lives in foster city, and she usually drives out to berkeley to hang out.  but i think last night we kinda decided to like meet in SF, its in the middle! :)  and cindy's from SF too i think.    ok anyway.  the plumber man is coming today.  i've been complaining to will forever about the water pressure here.  like its really strange- the cold water is fine, lots of pressure.  but the hot water's water pressure is like almost non-existent!  like for the shower or the kitchen sink, you turn the hot water COMPLETELY on and its still really small.  its been annoying me.  plus im going to have him put up the blinds in the living room.  dunno what else..he's still sleeping!
