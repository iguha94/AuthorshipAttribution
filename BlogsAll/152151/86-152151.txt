what a day yesterday was. im so pooped!  me and kareen headed out with will to sf in the morning and did shopping shopping shopping.  not too crazy though- well at least not me!  it sure is tiring shopping!  then we headed over to metreon and watched the 2:30 showing of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood- it was SUCH a chick flick! haha.  then me and kareen had sashimi at the sushi place in metreon- it really wasnt that good, i still like sushi house better!  then will met up with us and we went to macys cuz he wanted to try out those dockers pants? the ones with the hidden pocket? hehe.  - which he bought two pairs of!  then we headed home on the bart and andy picked us all up at the ashby bart station.  then we headed home and watched the lakers game!  by this time me and kareen were so pooped she fell asleep and i had a headache so i took a nap.  we woke up when the game ended and we headed to baja fresh and then to go see sum of all fears at emerybay.  but it was pretty much sold out so we ended up watching undercover brother- which actually wasnt bad as i was expecting it to be!  but yes what a long day.  today we're going to a wedding!  i hope i have time to get my hair cut this morning- its really getting too long.  but we'll see about the time constraints.  i'll let u know more about it when we get back! byee!
