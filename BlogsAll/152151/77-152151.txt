ok maybe we will get a kitty. who knows.  i havent seen one that i really liked yet. we're going to take a look tomorrow.  can u believe it! im almost done paying off my damn laptop!! ahaha!  seriously, i could have paid it off way sooner if i hadnt shopped so much.  well i didnt shop THAT much?? but yes im so close to done im so happy! this laptop is like my baby ahaha.  seriously!  like its the first like thing that was pretty damn expensive that i paid for all on my own!  like my parents didnt pay or anything!  i guess at a certain age (21? hell no!) you gotta start weaning yourself off your parents.  by the time i graduate, i want to have a good amount of money saved, (and of course a job!) so that way i can really try to be more independent.  its kind of exciting isnt it?  to like go out into the world and be independant!  i wouldnt want to be like 25 and like still living at home and having my parents buy me stuff!  maybe 22? 23? haha. just kidding.  i dont think i could ever live at home though- not that i dont mind visiting every once in a while- but i definitely need my freedom!  i dunno how will does it- being so independent- he pays for everything himself (well he is 25..)..like rent, utitlities, food..etc..and on top of that he's got me too! tsk tsk.  but we're trying to be better and not spend so much money.  vegas 3 weeks from yesterday!  it still seems so far but its arriving soon!  ok back to my cs homework...im just stupid! hehe.   bye!
