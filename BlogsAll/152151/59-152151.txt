hmm blogger seems to be acting so slow lately...  anyway..lets see..hm i thought i had posted more recently..but anyway.  last night was divine- a party that my sorority throws each year- like i wasnt looking really forward to it at all, just because i feel like i've been around for so many of them.  but i actually had fun last night!  it was actually fun!  and whats even more cool was that i didnt drink much and STILL i had fun..haha..i guess there's something to be said about maturing...  so anyway i was so tired today, like really really tired.  i stayed in bed and just was lazy.  i was soo unproductive today its like today didnt even happen!  very very bad.  tomorrow will be a more productive day- i promise!  oh guess what- its 10pm and i havent had a cigarette all day!  isnt that great?  im wondering if its really that im good like that or just that i've been too lazy to smoke?  cuz i know if i had actually gotten out of bed before 5pm and actually did something with the day i would have smoked- but being all lazy i felt no urge to smoke..so im not addicted?!!!  yay!  oh well ahah, we'll see..i cant stay in bed everyday..  spring break is coming up.  i feel SO bad.  one of my best buds from high school- her bday is this friday and i REALLY REALLY wanted to be in LA to celebrate with her u know?  cuz i hardly see her, even when i do go down south.  but i have class on friday- and the plane tickets are so expensive- plus i have to work on my damn cs project and get it done asap with my project partners before they leave for spring break- that i just cant get down there. i feel really really bad!!  i suppose i def should call her asap to let her know- but i feel so guilty!  argh!  i hate feeling guilty!  oh well!  byee!
