so let me tell you what happened yesterday! talk about stress! so im working on my cs homework right?  i tried not to procrastinate but i thought i only had one part left to do and turned out thats the longest part..smart huh..so im working on it late at night..and at 1am the servers went down!  servers down (school eecs ones) = not being able to compile or test or debug code.  pretty much all i could do is write it...and have no clue if it really works or not...and hmwk was due at 2pm today!    looking back, i dont know why i was so stressed, i should have realized that the prof would extend the hmwk deadline..but i was stressed anyways..all night and this morning too! servers didnt come back up until 3pm this afternoon.  but WHEW, the professor extended the deadline till Friday 2pm. YAY..so im def. going to try not to procastrinate..hehe..it was funny- i was watching the lecture he gave today (through berkeley webcast)..and he did this little like cheering dance at the beginning- i guess cuz he had announced that the hmwk deadline would be postponed and people were probably cheering cuz they were happy..it was soo cute and funny..and then i came home and i went to show it to will- but somehow it had gotten cut out of the broadcast! strange..but it really was funny.  anyway.  so im feeling good about things.  i finished my ee homework! yay!  so lets see- i just gotta do cs and math hmwk..do reading for cs and ee, and then look at my cs and ee labs that i have tomorrow..and its only 9pm! ..going to be a long night..  but ok! i better get on it!
