ok so where was i last time?  oh yes, john's baby.  it is SOO cute! i dunno- babies make me happy! they make me smile so much that my jaw starts to hurt heehee.  but i definitely think i want to wait till i'm older to have one..ahah..u know, like not as soon as i get married, but more like 27-28ish time.  you're only young once and once you have kids, they're such a huge responsibility.  but this baby was definitely adorable to look at- it had a sO much hair under his little hat!  ahhh so cute.    man im pretty pooped.  but im really proud of myself!  i finished my cs homework! yay! all by myself too! serious thats a big deal for me heehee.  and i figured out how to connect my comp here to my school account and everything..little things are victories for me. :)  i've decided i really dont want to work.  like i feel like i have so much studying to do, that i barely ever even have any time to relax- and its cut down even more when i have to work.  but i think i'll try to hang in there till march..which hopefully by then my company will have layed everyone off, and i hoping for a reasonable (probably pitiful) severence pay.  i doubt it cuz im part time, but still- i've been there for almost 2 1/2 years! thats gotta count for something!  but i should def. get to bed.  im just up cuz im trying to get my hair dry before i go zzz..tomorrow there is a rush event thats bbq with our bro fraternity.  i wasnt planning on going, but i told my lil bro i would- and i havent seen him for a while and i think it'd be nice to hang out with him.  ooh me and kareen and tina are going to henrys tomorrow night- its two for two tuesdays or something- 2 drinks for the price of one.  will isnt going.  im not that big a drinker though- so maybe 2 will be just enough..hehe.. i do have 8am on wednesday.  anyway, going to go blowdry my hair.  gotta get some good rest!  999999!
