what a funny night last night was.  me and will were bored so we decided to play pokemonopoly.  yes- POKEmonopoly.  hehe.  i think i just felt like winning something- usually im really good at monopoly and i always kick butt.  so i figured it would be fun for us to play.  2 players is kind of strange but i figured who cares.  so we play.  and i've got like 3 different monopolies + nidoking (boardwalk) and will has ONE monopoly...and guess what..i die a HORRIBLE death.  it was ridiculous.  i landed on his hotels every time i went by!  and i had to mortcage? everything to pay him and by the time i unmortcaged everything i would land on his hotels again.  it was pretty ridiculous.  i was not happy. ...which leads in to my competitive ness!!  will was definitely not happy that he was kicking my butt because he was REALLY kicking my butt and i was very not happy.  i dont think we're ever going to play pokemonopoly again..haha..until im not so competitive!  laker game tonight! yay!  seal the deal!  strangely its actually pretty cold up here today..but its only 1130 so maybe it'll warm up?  but im going to pick up kareen at 330 and we're going to go to target! i really dont want to spend much cuz i want to pay off my bills in time for vegas (still paying off that laptop..which would have been LONG paid off if i could just stay away from banana...and kate spade...), but i want to get a digital scale.  i have a one of those analog ones and its just hard to tell sometimes.    i guess i'll find something productive to do! byee!
