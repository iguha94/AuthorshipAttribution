good morning! so i forgot to add to my entry the other day- WEDNESDAy,  i got my car towed!  can u believe it!  i'm so lame- but we were in a rush to turn in our calbot and get to the review session that I parked on hearst between soda and cory u know?  and i swear I knew before, towaway-zone 4-6pm!  my class? 4-530!  i was wondering why I found a parking space so easily...so i get back and there are NO cars there! and im like SHIT! :(  but its ok, after $75 towing fee and a $34 parking ticket..everything is ok.  man car's sure get expensive.    so i woke up this early to watch pokemon! and it was a rerun..never fear though.. i think the new ones are today at 8/7 central!  (too many commercials).  so i'm flipping through channels and i'm drawn to infocommercials- as usual.  they have something called a steam bullet.  like i really want a steam buggy, to clean- and this steam bullet looks like a minature version - only $50! but it looks kinda dinky..so i dunno.. but then i saw one for AB-Tronic.  Looks pretty interesting..something about getting something for nothing...the path for us lazy people..we'll see though..i can just imagine will- NO!  he likes to say no alot.  did i mention?  i got this thing for 30% off kate spade.  my heart skipped a beat.  i LOVe kate spade. and will said no. :(  ..so very very sad. and its only good for this weekend too! :(   that was pretty bummy..  kk be back after pokemon maybe!
