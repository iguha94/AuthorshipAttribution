yay so we went semi shopping today!  it feels like its been SOO long since i've been shopping..but i've been paying off bills bills bills..and i guess it wasnt really like shopping shopping though.  we had this gift certificate for crate and barrel for xmas so we thought we'd use it- its kind of hard finding $80 worth of stuff- but we got lots of little cute things.  ooh and i went to coach and exchanged this make up bag i got for xmas also.  like i really hate exchanging things because i feel bad- but then like whats the point of keeping something you wont use?  at least if you exchange it for something you do use- then it makes the gift that much better!  it was cool- cuz i found this little palm pilot holder at coach which was exactly the same price- and it matches my blue visor like almost perfectly!  then we went to banana and i got these two tops- from the sale rack!  im very proud of myself- i soo rarely go to the sale racks..im going to try only shopping for things on sale now..its going to take a bit of adjusting to..but it'll def. save me money!  so i am no longer in debt! its a beautiful feeling! plus im getting another paycheck this friday, and my friend who owes me money is paying me back this week too!  things are going well- plus i get severence pay for a month from my job because we all got laid off! yay!
