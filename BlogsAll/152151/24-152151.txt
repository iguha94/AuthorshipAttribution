i woke up this morning determined to ace my ee final.  DETERMINED!  i can do it!  well i have to regardless hehe.  but i can do it! i can do it! i can do it! i hope i can anyway.  i have this thanksgiving weekend to do lots of studying, especially cuz i'll be stuck at work alot of the time.  so study study study study study. no more depression about this damn class! gotta kick up my heels and just get it done!  watched smallville last night.  i really like that show!  me and will watch it religiously.  i like dark angel too, probably just cuz jessica alba is hot, but its on friday nights and who is really home friday nights to watch it!  yes- we could record it, but then u'd have to make time to watch it! too busy.  our formals are december 1st, and im pretty bummed cuz will has a golf scramble thing that day at 3pm.  which is not good- cuz formals start like 6 or like 630 ish?  and like i dont mind if he comes late- i can always just catch a ride over there w/kareen and andy but my question is- HOW late is he going to be!  pretty lame to sit there the whole time by myself- especially if he's missing dinner- which is what we're paying for anyway...so we'll see..i just suggested bringing someone else and he was like a guy? and i was like of course- i dont do none of that girl asking girl thing (hehe), and he was like hmph.  but oh well- if he really cant make it maybe i can convince shirley to go as my date hehe.  i already tried to talk her into going with christian and being the 4th couple at the bm table but she was like no no no.  i will try again though. haha.  ok maybe i should start studying...nah.. :)
