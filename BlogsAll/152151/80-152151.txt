KITTTYYYYYY!!!!  dont ask me how i did it but i did it!  i convinced will for us to get a kitty!!! KITTTTYYY!!  hopefully we'll get it later this week, the one we're looking at, her name is  ashley , and she's going in for surgery tomorrow (to get spayed).  she is grey with blue eyes.  beautiful.  sooo pretty!  short hair though, which is good i guess.  but if you wanna see a picture of her:    http://www.hopalong.org/cats.html   , scroll about half way.  it says shes a boy but i talked to her foster mom and its a girl.   kitttyyy!!    theres actually another kitty too that i have my eye on.  i actually havent seen her yet, but i might go this weekend to see her.  i talked to this lady and she told me that they have 2 all white kittens.  one long hair and one short hair and one blue eyed and one yellow eyed.  we're going to see them on saturday.  so yes..we're considering, well i am anyway- two kittens.  that may sound like a lot, but i dont think its going to be too much harder than one kitten, and i dont want my kitten to by lonely when no one is home!  kitttyyy!!  ok i gotta stop thinking of kitties.  today summer school starts. yay.  i have like an hour and a half break between a lecture and discussion..but im thinking..maybe there wont be discussion on the first day?  but its summer school so probably there will be huh.  ugh.  well class at 11! i better stop dillydallying! byee!! kitttyyyy!!!!!
