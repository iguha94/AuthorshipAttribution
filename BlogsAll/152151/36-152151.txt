man i had SUCH a headache today!!  it was pretty bad, especially cuz i was at work, i think i was pretty damn grumpy to customers who were lucky enough to get me on the phone. hehe.  but will picked me home and got me into bed with advil and everything. like for me tylenol/advil never works by itself, i HAVE to have a nap, no matter how short- in order for my headache to go away.  it was nice though, when i woke up will had had dinner all made and set out and everything for me. i have such a good boyfriend. hehee.  but now i feel like my night is gone! i have so much studying to do! so much reading! pretty overwhelming.  ooh i found out that everyone at my workplace is going to get laid off next Friday.  its really no surprise, considering that we thought we'd all get laid off beginning of last summer!  but im actually glad its finally here- because now i really can't work! :)  i need to spend more time studying anyways.  i've been working there for almost 2 and a half years! crazy.  i started working there beginning of my sophomore year..so much has happened since then.  but oh well- gotta move on with my life. hehe.  so im having trouble with my ee homework- and im so annoyed like i went to my discussion and i was asking the TA and he was like, oh i cant give you the answer. i dont want the answer damnit- what good is the answer going to do me! i want to know HOW to get the correct answer- but he was so concerned with not giving me the answer that he was being incredible vague.  how annoying.  i need to find a tutor for that class..  but anyway. just thought i'd drop a note in!  oh my gosh! i had pizza for lunch today at work and there were SOO many mushrooms on it!  like usually i just pick them off cuz they are like a few here and few there, but this one had an ENTIRE layer of pizza..it wasnt pleasant..i think its what caused my headache..hehe..but will says im just being stupid. hehe..damn those mushrooms!  ok back to studying! byee!
