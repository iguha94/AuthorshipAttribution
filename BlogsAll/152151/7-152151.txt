i just got waken up!  its kinda funny actually, i heard all these people talking and laughing loudly and i heard girls too, and i was annoyed that i got waken up so i put on my robe and was about to go out there and tell them off but then i saw that the girls were sopis so i hung out with them for a bit. :)  im so easily riled up but just as easily placated!  i think they're watching saving private ryan in there right now, which was a pretty damn gory movie- i think i got a major headache from the first like half hour and slept through the rest when it first came out! but they get to enjoy it on will's big tv and soundsystem. :)  i think they just came back from kokos so they're pretty buzzed, and that explains their redness!!!  ok well since im up, i might as well do something? nah, too lazy. after this i'll go back to sleep and then study all tomorrow.  i had a hella stressful day today. i dunno if its that i really have all this stuff to stress about or i just stress myself out.  seriously, i was really stressed.  i worry about school, if im ever going to finish; i worry about money- so damn broke from shopping!; i worry about future finances and many more things!  i go insane real easily.  ok, will keeps stirring around in bed, my typing is annoying him! im going to head on to bed now! 99!
