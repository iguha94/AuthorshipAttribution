I just got an email from Esther saying that she's scared that she may live to see the end of the world. I think her fear is justified. Outside of relatively small intellectual and leftist circles, here in the United States, people are geared up for war. It's horrifying to me that so many people so readily want an invasion of Iraq. Blame the propaganda machine and rhetoric of George W. Bush, blame the fact that the United States is a superpower in search of a new enemy, blame arrogance, blame greed, and even blame human nature. It's a scary time indeed. While I don't think the literal end of the world will happen... perhaps change of civilization as we know it?   It's hard to say. We live in a time in which there is a growing global elite that is defined by both national and economic divisions. This elite at this global level, has less opposition than their national counterparts. There is no global "state" that regulates pure laissez-faire capitalism. Multi-national corporations take advantage of nations and people with almost no restriction in most parts of the world, despite the human rights movement. It's not like on the national level where there are laws to protect its citizens. Also there essentially there is no entity that can regulate the aggression of strong states against smaller ones. The United States' disregard for the sovereignty of nations in its way have been well documented and there is no global "police force" that can keep it from bullying other nations.  If World War 3 were to break out... is it possible that the notion of a global state will exist? Either from the United States exerting total dominance over the world or the nations of the world realizing that organizations like the U.N. have no real power and creating an organzation either that truly is a world government?  Who knows? That's just my rant for today.  ***
