[15545]  Now playing: the Smithereens - Behind the Wall of Sleep  Picard is fucking bad ass. He's brilliant, eloquent, can fight, and gets a lot of pussy. Sure my man Da Shat... Captain Kirk got more pussy than Picard. He got green, blue, and every other color possibly pussy; however, he didn't have the style Picard did. Picard used his brain as much as his big fucking phaser rifle to kick ass.  I stand by Cisco as my favorite. He was literally a god to a fucking planet and he punched Q.  Why can't we have a president like Picard? I'd vote for him.  Now playing: the Darkness - I Believe in A Thing Called Love  Wedding tomorrow. That means I have to get my ass up in the morning, look nice, and drive to San Diego. The food better be fucking good.  By the way it's just a coincidence that the song playing has to do with love and I'm talking about this happy lovey stuff.  This is sort of a silly thought based on something my mom said a while ago during this winter break... "I don't think you're getting married any time soon." I don't know what she means by that. I honestly have no idea where I'm going to end up in 4-5 years. I really don't have a clue about aspects of my life that I can actually control like work and fun... much less something as random and incontrollable like a relationship.  A lot of the reminicing my friends and I have been doing, plus the few drives up to LA sort of made me wonder how my own life will turn out. "Que sera sera... what will be will be..." but "what will it be like when I get old" (some song lyrics for y'all). I'll hopefully have my phd by age 28. Then what? Will I still be getting down in the pit? Where will I live? Where will I work? Will I still be a crazy drunk? Will I be tied down by that point?  Now Playing: NOFX - Franco Un-American  Oh well whatever... I'll just have my beer and watch history unfold.  ***
