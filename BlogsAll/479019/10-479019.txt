A totally interesting day!   I started the day off with a good response from my art project in Studio Art 65b. One of my business cards had a big middle finger with the letters FU next to it. If you know my real name then you know where FU comes from, beside the analogous meaning to the middle finger. That really got a good response. I also got a good response on my flaming name. It's nice to be appreciated!  I also realized that my ex's best friend's ex was in the class. Even stranger is that I ran into my ex while doing research at the library. It was weird. We talked a bit and I helped with her homework (the girl still attracts bad luck like a voodoo curse!). That was just weird seeing her again.   Anyway after that I went to work. I made a phone call to 94.3 to request some  T(I)NC . I didn't hear it played, but the D.J. seemed really interested in the band. She said she would see if she could play it. That's all I can ask for anyway.   Work was actually pretty productive. I scheduled a lot of really tough faults and managed to do really well in Minesweeper. I got it down to one mine on the intermediate level!  I'm totally stoked for the  Rancid  /  NOFX  show tomorrow night! Good friends, good show, good fun!  ***
