[15681]  Listening to some  Duran Duran  right now... "Last Chance"  My external drive kit is acting up again. It's pissing me off and it's making me tempted to buy a real external drive.  Let's see... today so far I've done some cleaning, had a bagel, balanced my check book, picked up readings at school, skimmed through the readings, had a chicken sandwich, craved English muffins, watched  That Thing You Do  and played around with photoshop - not necessarily in that order.  Listening to some  Great White  right now... "Once Bitten Twice Shy"  I ran into some on campus that I don't like running into. He's the only person in Binghamton that I really dislike. There's weird people on campus for sure, but those weird folks are nice. This guy has an underlying assholeness beneath his fake niceness. He's just plain fucked up. It's not so much talking shit that he does, but he tries to turn you against people. He also thinks he's a do-gooder and says he tries to help others. He's a loser. I think he's a load of crap and I wish he wouldn't talk to me at all. He's someone who I'd beat up if given the right reason.   Listening to some  Propagandhi  right now... "Ska Sucks"  I need to go over the 2 articles for Kusno's class again tonight, then tomorrow I need to go through the Crosby book and article for Lee's class. Yay 240 pages!  **
