Today was actually quite productive.  I managed to gets some pictures from my trip to Europe scanned, work out, and start a new painting.  Hopefully I'll get some of the pictures up soon. I scanned pictures of Amsterdamn, Venice, and France.  My work out today was alright. I haven't worked out in a while which meant my body couldn't bust out as much power, but I managed to tire myself out. I really need to keep this up so that I'm in shape for the wrestling tournament in March.  As for my new painting, I'm painting Notre Dame Cathedral. I'm painting it from one of the photos I scanned today. It's actually coming out really good. I'm surprised. I think my painting lately has been many times better than it was since I last painted which was approximately 1.5 years ago. You would think that not painting in a long time would make it so that I'm out of practice, but that's not the case. Maybe the reason why I'm painting so well right now is because I'm  feeling  more right now than I have in a while. And art after all is about an external expression of what's inside of you.  Something else about painting recently, is that it's one of the few escapes that I really have from the frustrations around me. That's a good thing.  I should probably study for midterms or read for my history classes.  The song of the moment is "Evangeline" by Bad Religion from  Process of Belief  (2002).  ***
