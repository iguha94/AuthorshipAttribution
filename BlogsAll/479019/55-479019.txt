I'm 23 and I always feel a pull between wanting to stay young and having to grow up.  People say I've done a lot in my life despite my age. I was an athelete, musician, involved in student government in high school. I've volunteered at high schools, coached wrestling, and worked 4 very different jobs. I had 2 majors and a minor and I'm in a phd program right now. I've seen cities all over California, and been to Reno, Vegas, Taiwan, Mexico, and Western Europe. I've stage dove, moshed, been to operas and musicals, the great museums of the world and been to a fringe festival more or less. I've seen a punk rock midget, S&M people, prostitutes in Amsterdam, and met pro-wrestlers. I've been drunk, beaten, bloody, and burned. I've been in newspapers and I have many friends. You would think that I've lived enough to grow up. Or perhaps since I've lived an interesting life, I'm reluctant to grow up.  This growing up thing, where I should act and dress more respectably is tough. At some point in the next few years, I'll end up teaching college course and eventually be called professor... I'll have to look and act professional. I can't be as nihilist or apathetic as I am now. I shoud be worrying about getting a job when I graduate and becomeing "successful." Yet I'm still in a phase of my life right now where I still want to stage dive at shows, crush beer cans with my skull, and wear punk band shirts.  The fact that I was annoyed at the lack of chaos and mayhem at last night's grad student party makes me aware of unwillingness or inability to "grow up." I had a good time last night, but there wasn't the drunken revelry that representative of what I want in my life.   I think of the  Descendents  song "When I get old."  ***
