I was talking to Naomi N. earlier tonight and she mentioned to me a girl that we knew back in high school is back in town and doesn't know anyone anymore. I think that topic ressonates with me because I sarcastically said in class on Monday that I grew up in a farming community. It makes me think about how home, while a static concept in the heart, is a constantly changing place in the real world. The Irvine of my childhood, of orange groves and fields of peppers and strawberries, has been replaced by homes, and shopping centers. New developments are still constantly popping up... I remember even just before I left Irvine, that at the intersection of Jamboree and Bryan... I still wasn't used to the Market Place surrounding me at all sides. I still remember riding my bike with Brandon past fields of peppers to get to what was at the time the Tustin Market Place. The example of this girl makes wonder what would it have been like to be like so many others and had left Irvine for my undergrad and now find myself permanently back in a very different Irvine. Not only is the place physically different, but so many of the people I knew are gone. It's something that I could perhaps face when I finish my phd. Or maybe I'll never return to Irvine physically like so many others... like Jon, like Evan. When you return, how does it change how you feel about home? I think that right now... I understand Stephanie's fear of leaving Irvine. Clinging on to home physically, because you don't want to lose touch with your perception of home. I'm suddenly deeply afraid of what it will be like if I return to Irvine after 5-6 years in Binghamton.   This also makes me realize that this is the longest I've ever been away from Irvine.   ***
