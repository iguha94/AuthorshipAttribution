Watched  Reservoir Dogs  er... more like finished it. This was the first time I've seen the ending, despite having seen the begining many times.  Wrote 2 pages for 616. 8 more to do for that particular paper.  Made a mushroom and spinach stuffed chicken breast. Not bad, but rice and a white wine sauce would have been nice. Alas I lack white wine.  Chatted with friends.  I had a little talk with Nancy, who is rather upset right now with boy troubles. I gave her a bit of advice on it, or perhaps more like blunt answers on the cruelty of life. The truth is you can't make anyone like you. This ain't the movies. If it were, I know I'd have attempted a serenade, a de Bergerac-like or high school comedy-like ploy. Since we live in reality, it's a good thing I haven't. The only thing you can do is just be yourself and live life.   I suppose I could be upset that in the past 3 years I haven't dated anyone for more than 2 weeks. Well I am somewhat annoyed that I don't like the ladies that like me, and the ladies I like don't like me back. But, then again when you've been in a long relationship before, specifically one who's duration accounts for 8% of my total life span... you're a bit more critical about things. I really don't want to settle for anyone, plus for the most part I'm rather content in that area of my life. I only make a big deal / verbalize certain things to remind myself to not be too content.   Anyway... Nancy will get over it. People usually do.  I wonder if I should watch another DVD or get writing? I promised myself to have 15 pages of writing done this weekend, and right now I have 2...  My apartment smells like sauteed mushroom... mmm...  ***
