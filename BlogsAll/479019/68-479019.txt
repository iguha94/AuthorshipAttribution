[14839]  Woke up this morning to "Stacy's Mom" by Fountains of Wayne. Eh...  There's a shadow over me that always reminds me of possibilities if different decisions were made. This shadow may or may not know that she's a shadow over me, but I think she does on a subconcious level at least.  Something I was thinking about on the bus, on my home from grocery shopping earlier this morning was my so-called intellectualy journey. When I went to UCI, I was pretty sure that I wanted to be a history major or possibly an art major. However, I went in undecided for some flexibility. I became a history major officially at the end of my freshman year. I liked being a history major, but I felt an unease with the discipline. As I took more course in other subjects, I found that I had an affinity for sociology, anthropology, art history, and studio art. I felt more and more and disciplinary boundaries were too restrictive for me. I ended up adding sociology as a major at the end of my junior year and finishing a digital arts minor. I felt sociology has enough flexibility as a discipline that I chose it for graduate school. I didn't have to choose a chunk of time-space to be an expert at.  Here at Binghamton, I like how flexible and the freedom I have to interdisciplinary. However, that flexibility has a price. As I get into my 2nd year the looming area papers and the eventual dissertation worry me. I need to narrow my fields of interest down. Scary stuff...  I'm tired...  ***
