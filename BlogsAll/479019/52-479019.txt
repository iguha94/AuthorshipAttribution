[14543]   Work later today... maybe pay Michaels or Fry's a visit.  Call some people to see if there's anything exciting going on.  Tomorrow is work and go have dinner with the girls.  Sunday is PM's birthday and dinner with Shadowfax people.  So I got a marker and drew SUFFER on my arm / shoulder in the font of Bad Religion's  Suffer  album. It actually looks kind of cool. I think pay a place a visit Monday to see how much it'd be to get that done. Why "suffer" you might ask. Well there are several real reasons. Two are that the name Sufferboy has stuck with me since high school, and Bad Religion is my favorite band. Also I think the word itself has deep meaning for myself personally and philosophically. The existence of suffering is a component of so many of the world's religions. I think suffering is what reminds us of our mortality and correspondingly our humanity. Where as it is joy that gives us a taste of the divine. It's like... when you feel pain... time exists for you. You count the seconds, minutes, hours, etc. But when you're happy... time doesn't matter to you. Days, months, etc... go by as if you were a immortal and those measures of time go by without you noticing.  I think a tattoo this summer is appropriate because... well... despite all the things I've done... I haven't been happy. I know I'm sounding emo right now... but it's been a long time since I was really happy. I remember last summer Jenny was making fun of me for never being happy or knowing joy. I guess I know being content, but happiness?  **
