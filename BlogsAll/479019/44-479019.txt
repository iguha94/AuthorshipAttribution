I celebrated the 4th of July yesterday by watching GI Joe on DVD and having a BBQ.  It was cool. I had high school and UCI friends there. Maybe 13 people showed up? We drank a lot of beer and ate a lot of meat. Then we sat around smoking flavored tobacco mixed with a little weed. After that me and the posse went to watching T3.  T3 was cool, more enjoyable than fireworks. It's not as good as the first 2 in so many ways; however, it went by really fast. Before I knew it the 2 hours were up. Arnold was hilarious in some parts, but I don't think he had the intensity that he had in the first 2. Also the lack of Linda Hamilton hurt the movie. I think the cameo by the psychiatrist was a nice touch though.  So Bush made a speech yesterday about how the United States is an important part in shaping the world. As a superpower, yes it is true that the U.S. does affect a lot of what goes on. However, when he says things like, "Without America's active involvement in the world, the ambitions of tyrants would go unopposed and millions would live at the mercy of terrorists." That's a further slap in the face to all the people we've run over in order to maintain our dominance.  I have to admit that we did a good job in places like Japan following WWII, but through out most of the Cold War... we didn't bring peace and democracy to most of the places we sent soldiers. We left the countries ravaged and in chaos.   Anyway... gonna see the Vandals tonight. Should be fun  ***
