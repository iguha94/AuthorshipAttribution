It's been a good weekend. Yesterday I went to the Andy Warhol exhibit at MOCA with Julia and Naomi. It was quite a good exhibit. I've never seen so much art from one artist before. They had everything from Marilyn Monroe, Jackie Kennedy, Chairman Mao, to Elvis in addition to soup cans. Afterwards we met up with Janet and Flo to go to Citywalk. Citywalk... is... pretty much like any of the other outdoor malls here in southern California... such as Downtown Disney, Spectrum and the Block. It just has what I guess is a "hipper" vibe since it's quite a destination for people in the Los Angeles ADI. I hadn't been there in about 2 years, and it's still just as crowded. We had some good Italian food at Bucca di Beppo and it was quite fun hanging out with my female posse as it always is. As Suzanne commented on not too long ago, I have a lot of female friends. It's cool though. These girls are enough like my buds of the "Irvine Posse" from high school, that it's always cool just hanging out. Of course things are slightly different being they're all girls and I'm the only guy in the group, but I never feel out of place.   Today, was relaxation for most of the day and eating leftovers from Bucca di Beppo. My "Irvine Posse" did come over so we could watch the WWE PPV. We had some fine, but cheap beers such Quilmes from Argentina and various versions of Eureka beer. It was lots of hanging out and talking, the PPV was mostly a background thing... the good thing is it was free thanks to Derek's box. From what I remember of the PPV, it was pretty good. Nothing too spectacular though. I found the DX chants from the audience when HBK came out to talk to Triple H amusing. Goldust and Booker is always funny. Bischoff is just such a heel, he's great in an annoying way.  Tomorrow I have work, I don't know if I'm supposed to go in at 8 or 8:30 AM... I think it will ultimately depend on when I wake up.  ****
