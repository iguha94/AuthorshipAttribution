I think the presentation could have used some red to make it better visually. I was thinking about putting some diced tomatos on top for that purpose, but alas I didn't.     Breakfast ain't bad, but for some reason my potatoes have been coming out kind of dry. It's either package or I'm doing something different. The oil?  It might have something to do with the fact I'm using olive oil instead of a generic vegetable oil. The smoking point for olive oil is 375F. That means the pan can't get nearly as hot as a generic vegetable oil that smokes at 425F or higher. I belive butter is around 300F. The lack of heat makes it harder to get that crisp outside without drying it out.   I should brew some coffee for that extra pick up when reading huh? I'm going through my can of coffee pretty quick, but then again I put like 5 times the suggest amount of grounds into the filter. I should also probably brew double so that I can just nuke a cup some mornings.  In other food news, I should probably pick up some frozen berries for a smoothie. The weather's been nice... in the 70s the past few days. It'd be nice to chill with a smoothie.  After I'm done with my work on campus, I'll watch  the Pianist  tonight with my left over pizza. I wonder if it's as good / as sad as Steff hyped it up to be. I remember the last time she hyped up a movie ( Amelie ) and I was disappointed.  Speaking of film... what should I do my research on this semester!? Newsreels? Political films?  ***
