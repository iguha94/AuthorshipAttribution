Art History 550E: 10/10 (Dec. 15)  Art History 572F: 16/17 (Dec. 10)  Sociology 607: 12/18 (Dec. 16)  Sociology 616: 11/20 (Dec. 11)  Totals: 49 / 65 = 75.3%  Remaining: 16 pages / approx. 10 days = 1.6 per day ~ with some buffer  I needed a break from writing for a few days. This weekend I plan on getting 2 papers completed, polished, and ready to turn in early in the week.  I did my presentation on the  Planet of the Apes  and I guess it was well received. I think that was the best presentation that I've done in a while... but I'm never satisfied with my work. Tom said that what I talk about in the end of my paper was really interesting. It was the idea of the built environment not being merely used for the film, but it is an actor in the narrative of history. This in many ways reflects a circular relationship in all cultural 'actors' in the late 1960s and 1970s. I think I would expand on that circular movement and say that the narrative of the  Planet of the Apes  further parallels the built environment in how the laying fallow of 'ghettos' later resulted in gentrification.  I plan on polishing up that paper this weekend so it's ready by Wednesday.  Oh yea I had gyoza / potstickers with Tami and Wataru... that shit rocks.  Tomorrow I've got errands to run and I get to make dinner for someone.  ***
