I got home last night from watching LOTR with Steff and her work friends. It was a good movie, but I'm going to go on a little rant right now.  Roger Ebert was right about the flatness of the story and characters this time around. Indeed the characters are technically supposed to span the whole series; however, none of the characters bessides maybe the hobbits Pippin and Merry show any real flair or depth. Sam and Frodo were really annoying the fuck out of me. I'll just come out and say it... Sam is a wiener and he probably wants Frodo to... well... see his wiener. I'm not even sure why they included the stuff on Arwen. Her role in the movie was pretty pointless, because Aragorn was so flat as a character. He would have been much cooler if they did more on his identity as a ranger versus his identity as a king. Give him conflict like Smeagol / Gollum had in the 2nd movie. Gimli was a character that had personality, but no air time to show it off.  I personally think that the Lord of the Rings' greatness lies in the overall narrative, not the specific details. It's a good story with great special effects. I think the battle in the 3rd movie had a bit more tension than in the 2nd one. I think that of similar battles... the one in  The Empire Strikes Back , which they kind of rip off is better.  Anyway... that movie is more of a B+ / A- movie for me. It didn't reek of WOW like other movies I've seen.  Ok... so I just had breakfast and lunch combined in a 2 hr span of time while watching  I Love Lucy ,  A Team , VH1, and infomercials.  I should go out and enjoy sunshine today.  ****
