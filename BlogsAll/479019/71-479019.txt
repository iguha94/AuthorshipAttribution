...from the bird and the deer who live on the same to the condominiums that litter the plain it took time... time and disregard from the green and the trees that shot high in the air to the high-business market-men who take all that's there it took time... time and disregard - Bad Religion from  Into the Unkown  (1983) Yes... that song is a 7 minute epic.  So like I met with my grad director, and the future grad director today. So it was a 2 on 1 meeting. I feel like Tomich and Lee are extremely responsive and were even suggesting potential research and funding opportunities. India isn't an ideal place to potentially do research, (I would prefer the cool cultural studies places in the UK) but the fact that they made suggestions made me feel good. I guess what I need to do now is narrow down a committee and my areas. I think I'll do that this winter.  Here's a comment... if a seminar is already 3 hrs long, going over 1/2 an hour is brutal... ESPECIALLY if it's before a holiday weekend!  Tomorrow I get to play chauffeur for some friends. Woohoo getting behind the wheel of a car! It's funny when someone admits to not being a good driver and wants you to drive.  So motherfucking  Flogging Molly  at the Hollywood Avalon (formerly known as the Palace) on Jan 10!  I just called Esther and she said she doesn't know if she can go, because she'll be a temporary pirate due to an eye patch after getting eye surgery. Bummer... cause I know she'd appreciate the songs about whiskey and the blaring bagpipes, fiddles, electric guitars and bass. Man I love Celtic punk!  Cookies are in the oven. Maybe I'll write after my cookies.  ***
