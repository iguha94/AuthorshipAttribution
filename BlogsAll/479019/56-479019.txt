I was up a bit before 6 AM talking to Esther about her potential trip to NYC.  Then I managed to go for a 1.5 - 2 mile jog around 6:30 AM, showering and making breakfast afterwards. After all that good stuff, I went grocery shopping and I'm currently doing laundry.  I'm a productive bastard today aren't I?  I want to get something off my chest. I think that I should perhaps lower my standards when it comes to women. Seriously, in the past 3 years of my life I've only met one girl who I could say without a shadow of a doubt I want a serious relationship with. There have been dates, girls for challenge, and girls I wouldn't mind boning; however, there's only been one who really charmed me and continues to charm me. A relationship with her isn't a reality for many reasons. That I accept, but when it comes to meeting girls in the past year... they've had to live up to a standard set by this amazing girl. I don't know if that's healthy. This girl once told me that it's perhaps good to know what you want. But perhaps I'm not being fair and open enough to other "types" of girls? It's tough.  A lot of this messy thinking comes from seeing this young lady a few weeks ago. I hadn't really thought of her much for several months until I saw her again. She was really hot and just talking to her made my heart race. I really don't know what it is about her. There's a line dividing being over her and liking her again, and sometimes she tempts me to cross that line.  I just remembered that I forgot to buy berries. Fuck.  Anyway... hopefully new opportunities will present themselves this year.   I'm listening to some  Dropkick Murphys   ***
