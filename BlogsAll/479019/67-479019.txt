[14844]   A little writing is better than no writing right? I wrote a paragrah yesterday and a paragraph today.  Let's backtrack a bit shall we?  Friday night I just went out drinking with Wataru at Thirsty's. That place is pretty cheap, has food, and live music. Afterwards, we hung out at Tami's for a while.  Saturday I did jack shit. I woke up in the afternoon and ate breakfast at like 2 PM. Then I lounged around, played Arcanum, watched  Star Trek: Insurrection , and surfed the web.   Star Trek was a good movie. I think it might be because I haven't watched any Star Trek in a long time. I'm looking forward to getting Nemesis next on Netflix.  Today is better. I woke up before noon... like 11:30-ish, and managed to clean the stove top, eat a bagel and some Quaker instant oatmeal, and write a paragraph or two... the two if you count some revisiing and editting of previously written stuff.  Ya know, every week or perhaps everyday, I wake up telling myself that I need to get shit done... and I never do. I have more than enough time to do it, but I don't. I really need to get in the groove of getting shit done. 'Cause I really do feel fear, when I think that I have only 2 months of school left for the semester and I have 70 pages of writing to get done. 70 pages to get done, and they're not allowing for any incompletes this semester. I think I have roughly 2-3 pages of brain storming written though... which is a start.  I think I need to have a plan and stick with it. I was thinking about getting weights, but I know I might buy them and be lazy about working out.  ***
