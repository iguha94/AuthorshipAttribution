[15653]  "not allowed ... dinner time seinfeld, simpsons, so-called life seen the reruns 20 million times" -  Descendents ' "Nothing With You"  I had to fix my order on Amazon due to a credit card problem, and was tempted to add   this  to my order. I ordered a TV tuner and USB hub in addition to some books. If only   Bemused  supported WinTV stuff. Then I'd have a remote!!!  So the Bush Administration is finally starting to admit that there aren't any WMD to be found in Iraq. Prior to the war numerous sources were saying that Iraq did not have the capacity to be building WMD following the first Gulf War. It's absolutely ridiculous how right wing people still think that Bush did the right thing saying that we still got Saddam. Are those people who lost children, brothers, sisters, family in the war? I'm talking about the rising body count for both Americans and Iraqis. I hope Bush doesn't win the election; however, I don't have a lot of faith in American voters.   Now playing:  1208 's 1988  Oh yea it's insane! The Outsiders (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall) in UPW! They're facing Tom Howard and a mystery opponent with Joe Millionaire as special referee! I wish I could go see it!  Stuff to do today:  photocopy stuff pick up picture read stuff check out books maybe go buy groceries   ***
