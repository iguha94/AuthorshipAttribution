Ok... I haven't gotten work done the past 2 days... well Wednesday I did do a bunch of reading.  I dunno... yesterday was just a really long day. I ended up checking out books after class, going home and watching  Escape from New York  and having a beer.  Escape From NY starts with some terrorists hijacking an airplane and crashing it in NYC, because the US is an imperialist and has become a police state. It came out in 1981, 20 years before... well you know...  Today I just did some grocery shopping, napped, and watched  Dude Where's My Car . It was an alright movie and had me chuckling a few times. I think it's funny in the tradition of movies such as  Bubble Boy . Although Bubble Boy was much more crass in its politically uncorrectness. Dude Where's My Car just made fun of stoners, jocks, Asians, Nordic people, nerds and handicapped kids, and new age folks. Hmm... ok maybe it's just as politically uncorrect.  Cissa asked if I wanted to go to Europe with her and Steff next summer. Wow if it actually happens, then it'll be going back to Europe with Steff since we met in England in what would be 3 years at that point. That should be fun...especially if, as I'm sure she will, has Mike go too. As great as those girls are, and me being used to dealing with estrogen... I could really use a fellow dude to hang with as the girls shop or something like that.  In other news... I discovered boiling chicken is great for making stock / broth for soup and making the meat extremely tender for shredding. That means chicken quesadillas! I think I shall have another right now!  ***
