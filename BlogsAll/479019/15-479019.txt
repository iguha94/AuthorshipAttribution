Here I am on day 3 in Binghamton. Once again I'm at the computer lab killing time. I basically have about 13 hrs to kill before my flight back to lovely O.C. tomorrow morning. I'll probably kill as much time here as possible before I head back to the hotel. I am such a computer/internet addict aren't I? I need to be around a computer almost every day! Something that's kind of annoying is that I get roughly 20 emails a day... most of them are just bullshit spam emails though. That basically means that if I don't check my email frequently, then my inbox is going to get overloaded. That simply wouldn't be cool.  My final grades are in now at UCI... I wonder if I should waste my money and call? I have no idea how much the roaming fees are. That kind of sucks... but I guess if I get bored enough I'll call.   Stuff to do in the upcoming week... besides working that is... I'll call Jimmy up when I get back. Hopefully we can hang out before he goes back home to the bay area. I'll also try to have lunch with Dan, and hang out with Jenny sometime in the week too. I'll also need to call up Minh-An about going to MOCA. In addition to that... I need to find out if anyone wants to go to the Weezer show in August.  Speaking of Weezer... the "Keep Fishing" video is going to feature the Muppets! How cool is that? I personally thought the videos from he  Green Album  were a disappointment. I'm also kind of bitter about them cancelling the show in Manchester, UK to film that horrible "Island in the Sun" video. It's tough to compete with the originality of the "Buddy Holly" video. I totally dig the "Dope Nose" video though... I mean come on! how can you compete with Japanese biker gangs? I guess the Muppets can!  ***
