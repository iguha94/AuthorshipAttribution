My Thanksgiving Holiday... quite an adventure.  It started Wednesday with my Greyhound bus breaking down on the side of the highway for 5 hrs in the mountains with no heat. Thus resulting in me being in a bus for 9 hrs. Needless to say it was not fun. I finally made it to NYC at around and met up with my cousin and her boyfriend and we walked around a bit (she lives really close to Times Square)... we did that Thursday morning too, before going to NJ for Thanksgiving. This city is like the epitome of capitalism. Corporations everywhere, stores! everywhere, adverstisements, etc.   NJ it was interesting, because it was my first time in 18 years back to the town I was born in. Kind of surreal. Made me think "What if I didn't move to CA?" We spent the night at my aunt and uncles and went back to NY in the afternoon. We hung around before going to my cousin's boyfriend's place... who was doing a film shoot for a class.  Saturday, we met up with one of my cousin's friends and we went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a vegetarian place for dinner, before I was on my way back.   It was a smooth trip... except for the drunken Irishman who they wouldn't let on the bus...  I've slacked off all day... I've basically slept and been on the internet all day. I have a lot of shit to get done too.  Good weekend though...  ***
