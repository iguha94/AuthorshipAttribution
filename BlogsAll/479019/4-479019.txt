Haven't been awake very long, but the hours that I have been awake have been productive.  I went to San Diego yesterday. It was cool. I had dinner with Julia and her friend and then went down to Andy's to have some drinks and see some experimental electronic music at the Casbah. It was pretty cool, but I was damn tired towards the end. The alchohol and the fact that I worked all morning was a factor. A contributing factor was the fact that before work yesterday, I only had a couple hours of sleep. Afterwork, I had gone out to eat with George and Lisa, and then I talked with Lisa on the phone for a while before chatting online until rather late. This all made my drive home pretty tough. I so did not want to fall asleep at the wheel.  I think one of the things I like most about San Diego is the radio. (Too bad I go reject from SDSU!). 91.1 and 92.1 are awesome stations. Seriously any station that plays the Hives has to pretty damn cool. I know all stations are influenced by corporations, despite 92.1 being independent. I know they cannot ignore those forces, but at least these stations aren't as influenced to the extent that KROQ 106.7 is.   I managed to get some studying done today, but I didn't get to go to the gym due to it closing early due to President's Day. I'm going to relax some more and then probably study more. Hopefully, I'll get a chance to get some painting done too!  Anyone else curious about what the nWo will do at the PPV?  ***
