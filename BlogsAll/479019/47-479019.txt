Ok... I got half way through proof-reading my 690F paper.  I have 13 pages left of 602 with 12 days more to go. It's do-able...   Listening to  Bouncing Souls  right now... good stuff...  I'm feeling restless... I wanna get out of the house.  So I keep seeing articles about metrosexuals... basically straight guys that seem gay. I think that's the most absurd term and idea I've ever heard of. Basically what it is, is dudes getting trendy and more self absorbed. This will undoubtedly fuel the cosmetic and fashion industries with men buying more useless stuff.  Look I do things like cook and I think I cook pretty damn well. I can slice and dice, bake, sautee, and grill and I dig chicks. I can sew and boobs turn me on. I know I have taste and style when it comes to home furnishings, but it has more to do with my artistic training than my sexuality.   Whether you like dudes or chicks has nothing to do with your abilities and tastes. Subculture and natural talents affect that stuff. Gay dudes are expected to dress nice, that's why they do. Girls are expected waste hundreds of dollars a month on useless crap, so they do. Not all of them make the best decisions though.   I suppose I could dress "nicer," but fuck that... I have no desire to spend $20 for shirts and $50 for pants / shorts. I don't need accessories outside of a watch for telling time, and an occassional hat when I have hair and don't feel like combing. My only vice is really fine dining... good food and its presentation is the only thing that I have a weakness for, but food is a neccessity in life... cologne is not.  **
