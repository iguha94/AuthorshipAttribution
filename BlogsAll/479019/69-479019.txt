[15211]  Art History 550E: 10/10 (Dec. 15)  Art History 572F: 14/17 (Dec. 10)  Sociology 607: 12/18 (Dec. 16)  Sociology 616: 9/20 (Dec. 11)  Totals: 45 / 65 = 69.2%  Remaining: 20 pages / approx. 14 days = 1.42 per day   Considering I have to talk to my professor about my MPPC papaer on Tuesday and present on my  Planet of the Apes  paper on Wednesday... I think I should have solid drafts of those papers done this weekend. That is very do-able actually. I should probably get what I need to have written done tomorrow, and then do a print out on Sunday. Print outs are easier for proofing, than on a screen. Then Monday, I'll try to get my ethnography paper into a polished draft format and have it ready for my professor's office hours on Tuesday.  I also have to check with Hollywood Video or Video King to see if they have  Conquest of the Planet of the Apes  because for some reason Netflix didn't send it like it was supposed to this weekend.  That basically means I'll have 16 pages left to complete by the 2nd half of the week.  Wow so I spent $150 on groceries last month. I think that this is because they changed the bus routes and I haven't gone to Walmart for stuff as much... Walmart is cheaper than Giant.  I was going to go grocery shopping today, but the rain convinced me not to go.  18 days until I'm back in California.  ***
