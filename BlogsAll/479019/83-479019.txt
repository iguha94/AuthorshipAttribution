[15290]  My burrito is sitting next to me right now, because it's too hot to eat at this very moment.  I'm listening to the new  Offspring  album  Splinter . It's alright. There are some tracks that I like, some that I don't. To rate their albums I'd go in this order:  Smash (1994) Americana (1998) Ignition (1992) Ixnay on the Hombre (1997) Conspiracy of One (2000) Splinter (2003) At least that's the order for now.  I feel old when I think about how it's already been almost 10 years since  Smash  came out.  The semester is creeping to an end... today was the last class for 616. That class was pretty fun... 572F was fun too. I think those were my favorite classes this semester. Taking 16 units was totally worth it this semester. The work wasn't as obscenely hard as people make 16 units seem to be.  I learned a lot and it forced me to be on task and get shit done. I still don't know what to do for next semester.  I'm amused by the song, "Spare me the Details" from  Splinter  that's playing right now. I know that's probably not a song that Brandon would dig. He doesn't dig Offspring's pop songs, and this song is a lot like "Why Don't You Get A Job."  I'm gonna make another burrito... but yea... I'm running low on food. I don't know if that's good or bad. I only have 6 days left here in Binghamton and I'll probably go out to eat a few times before I leave. Maybe I'll buy some frozen / instant food this weekend.  ***
