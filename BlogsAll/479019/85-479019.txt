"Flossing a Dead Horse" by  NOFX  is playing right now.  That song put me in a happy mood and made me think about all the potential live music for this winter break. The power of music is something Esther and I talk about from time to time. She's one of the few people I know that really "get it" when it comes to all the things you feel when you're down on the floor at a show. We've talked about how it's just such a great escape from the chore of daily life. It's like you feel invincible, you feel brotherhood (at some punk shows), feel anger, joy, and a connection to a social whole. I can't wait to see  Flogging Molly  in January. I plan on drinking the flask of whisky that my cousin Kelly gave me and dancing to fine sounds of Irish punk... you don't hear me say I wanna dance often do you?  I'm in a writing mood right now, but not in an academic writing mood. So I'll muse about a few more things...  I wonder what me and the boys will do for New Years this year. It's been a while since the whole  posse  has been together partying and living it up. Kaho didn't make Vegas in July and that was a damn shame, because that was perhaps THE MOST FUCKING AMAZING WEEKEND EVER!  Now playing  Guttermouth 's "She's Got the Look"  So in a week I'll have a masters degree in sociology and from there I'll be working on my doctorate. At 23 years of age, I believe I'm still the youngest person in my department. In theory, I could be done with my phd at 28... wow...   ***
