Very fucking funny when people on dialup (like me) download them. Of the real songs I've downloaded, nothing mind blowing has been downloaded yet. At least it's nothing as bad as  Rancid 's piece of crap  Indestructible .  Now on to another topic...  I was talking to Melissa earlier about individualism versus the masses of humanity. I thought my little spiel would be worth putting here. So basically I think humanity, if it weren't for the greatness of individuals, would pretty much be a plague on this planet. We've fucked so much stuff up.  En masse ... humanity is really dumb, war, corporations, slavery, screwing with the environment and really dumb popular culture trends. (This is the cheerful stuff I study in sociology). If it weren't for the coolness of certain people near and dear to me, and the brave / courageous / kind / generous actions of individuals around the world... then I'd say humanity should be wiped out.  Oh yea... and Melissa said she was watching  Ozma 's "Domino Effect" video. That makes me wonder when the  Vandals ' DVD will come out... in hopes that once again I will appear on the screen thanks to Kung Fu Records. Joe Escalante did promise to make me famous. If humanity is going to be wiped out, at least there will be images of me on film for alien archaelogists to find.  Is it just me or does the song title "Long Way Home" sound so typically SoCal punk? I could so see  Pennywise  doing a song by that name.  ***
