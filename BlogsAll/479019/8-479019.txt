Yesterday is now gone...   Watched some of the Seaview League finals at Laguna Hills High. It was a kind of a dissappointment, since Irvine's not the wrestling program it used to be. I also had to cut out early because I had to go check out a book from the UCI Main Library and have dinner with Lisa.  Dinner with Lisa was cool. She came over and made some Ecuadorian food... beef, potatoes, rice... at the time it was alright, but now many hours removed, I think it was really good. That's probably why I gobbled up all the left overs for lunch. I had the same delayed reaction when I had Ethiopian food with Naomi. I guess I need to contemplate before I appreciate. Afterwards we chatted on a variety of things, I taught her how to do charts on Excel and installed Power Point on her laptop, and we went to see  A Beautiful Mind , which was a good movie.  All in all yesterday was a cool day, topped off with good eats, and good entertainment.  Today is a different story. On my to do list today is...  Read  Stepping Left: Dance and Politics in New York City, 1928-1942  by tomorrow. It's 177 pages!  Do 14 statistic problems by Tuesday!  Read  African Perspectives on Colonialism  by Wednesday for my presentation. It's a 112 pager.  Read 2 history of coffee articles by Wednesday. They're 19 and 36 pages.  Write a 5 page paper on the 6 history of coffee articles I'm supposed to have read by Wednesday!  I don't even remember what I need to do for sociology 155!  If I get a chance I might try to work on Lisa's eucharist calendar dilemma.  Playing right now is "Anesthesia" by Bad Religion, a song which I won't be hearing on March 30th at the Palladium, because I won't be there!!!  **
