[15552]  I decided to go over some of the stuff from my religious studies courses. I am by no means an expert, but here are some of my thoughts on the development of Christianity. So in 325 CE, there was the Council of Nicaea which affirmed the 4 gospels that most people read today. The point of having those specific 4 was the Catholic Church's goal of defining Jesus's position in the order of things, because there was debate over how divine he was and his relationship with God. This is why John is so important to most Christians today. The them versus us stuff in that document where they single out Jews is part of it. It is to define orthodoxy in the religion. This orthodoxing persists into today. In the 13th century, Franciscan friar, William of Rubruck journeyed to the Mongol empire on behalf of Louis IX. There he came across other Christian sects such as the Nestorians. He actually denies that they are really Christians, because they argued for a duel nature in Christ. Nicaea had said he was fully divine. Then in the early 16th century there was the Reformation and various wars over religion. However, in the West and the places that it conquered their sense of Christ's divinity was still based on the full divinity that is most visible in the gospel of John. However this stuff is pretty fucked up in that it's a theology that comes from a guy that never met Jesus and was writing 70 years after is death far away from Palestine. He targeted Jews because he was not of the original Christians who were Jews themselves. That document would later be used to justify things like the Holocaust.   I really wonder if this stuff is ever explained to people who go to church, because it sure doesn't seem like it.   Someone once said that my obssession with understanding religions makes me religious in my own way. However, I don't use this knowledge to guide my life. I'm generally a nihilist in that I don't believe in objectivity.  ***
