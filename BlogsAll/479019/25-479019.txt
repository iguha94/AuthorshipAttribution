Was it a lazy day? Kinda sorta... I did get stuff done and do some socializing... which is nice.  I woke up this morning around 9 AM, checked my email and then went back to bed. Woke up around 12:30 PM and did some chit chat with my buddy Laine and absolutely killed her in Reversi. I've been teasing that girl a lot lately. Maybe I should ease up on her?  I went to campus to print out 'drafts' of my 601 and I marked them up nicely... I will get those revisions done probably Sunday. I'm not really in the mood to work on those right now. I feel more in the mood to get more writing of my 620 research paper done... which I did a little of earlier.  Wataru came by with his microwave in the evening and I bought it off him for $15. Now I don't have to worry about buying real groceries for next week... and can get some junk food.  I also did some chatting with Esther. It's a bummer that she won't be coming to Vegas with us. It's funny how things turn out. It's been like a year and a half since Cambridge... and I didn't really get a chance to talk to her back then, but now we communicate all the time. I always did think she was pretty cool back then, and getting to know her more now isn't a let down.   I'm enjoying my apple cinnamon tea right now, but I'm feeling kind of hungry... I should make something for myself.  In rotation right now  Face to Face ... who I might see in Jan?  ***
