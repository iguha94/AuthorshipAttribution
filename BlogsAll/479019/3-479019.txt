No school today, but I had to work. Lovely stuff as usual. I'm so getting tired of working there. There's just no excitement or anything cool about the job except for the fact that I get paid $10.20 an hour! Damn living in a capitalist society. Damn being programmed with the virtues of liberal consumerism! - - "Viva la Revolucin!"  At least I got to work out thanks to there being no school. I like the fact that my metabolism is fast enough that when I work out, I can totally see and feel a difference right away. However, I need increase my caloric intake to compensate. I'm noticing that if I don't get enough energy in my system, I'll get exhausted just like today after I worked out. I need to start getting up earlier in the morning to eat breakfast so that I have the fuel in me to last through the day! Having some extra protein in the morning should help muscle building too.  Did I mention that were hot girls at the gym? Spandex, stair steppers, and a good rear end view... that's all I've got to say about that.  Jon and Brandon are going to be over to watch Hogan on WWF RAW. That's going to amazing. The Hulkster back! Say what you will, but the big boot and leg drop is amazing!  The song of the moment is "I'm Like Yeah But She's All No" by the Mr. T Experience from their  Love is Dead  (1996) album.  ***
