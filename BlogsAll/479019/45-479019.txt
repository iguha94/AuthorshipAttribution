I've been having weird / intense dreams as of late. Last night I had a dream where a friend coerced me to vandalized a banquet that was set up on the field by Santiago Hills. There were candles set up on the tables and I basically knocked shit over and set things ablaze. Only for the police to come after me. I tried to hide in the bushes, but they found me. Violent dreams like this usually result in me waking up sweating and hardly able to move. It's like my body was physically responding to what was going on in my mind.   Yesterday was a long day of work, then a 2 hour drive to LA for the free AM Radio in store show. I could have really used someone for carpool usage. It was pretty cool. They're significantly better than they were like 1.5 - 2 years ago when I saw them. It was cool meeting Toni-Lynne and Diana also. That brings my boardie meeting count to 4.... I feel like such a nerd for saying that. But it's not like I have no real life connections to these folks as Janet knows Toni-Lynne. We hung out at Jack In The Box... a cool one with bullet proof glass protecting the people inside and then we tried to go to the after party on Vine. I gave up trying to find parking after a bit of driving around. Have I ever mentioned hating parking in Hollywood?   Man I got made fun of in my quest to bring goodies back for Steff. This girl made fun of my for not wearing the free buttons I got for Steff and because the drummer made his autograph out to Stephani (not a typo)... as the CD got passed to the rest of the band, they kept joking around that my name is Stephani. I wonder if I should fill in the missing e for the band? Hah... she'd never know. Well now that there's a record here, maybe I shouldn't.  Work today at 4. I should do some writing prior to work though.  ***
