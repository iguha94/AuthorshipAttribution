It's strange working with Lisa. I treat her as if she's just another co-worker. But I can't help but feel weird with her around... especially when I was telling Julia how I'd cuss out Best Buy if they don't fix my laptop. Or how I have problems with a friend of mine.  Lisa and I always had this... serendipity thing between us, where things would always seem to up by accident. We saw that movie together too. Anyway the timing of certain stuff was almost enough for me to almost apologize to her. Something I never would even dream of doing up until today; however, luckily she took off early and people told me more about how they dislike how she does her job. That sort of reminded me of some of the reasons why I cussed her out to begin with. Narrow misses.  I hate burning bridges. There's a self-sabotaging aspect of my personality that I've long struggled with. It's like building the perfect city in Sim City only to ravage it with earthquakes and fires. Thanks to 2 conversations with 2 very cool people last night, I sort of realized I should stop doing that. However... there's something about Lisa in which I don't mind leaving that bridge burned.  I realize I've been naming names a lot more lately. I don't know why. I do realize that Lisa, as a person of authority at work, could make my life hell at Nielsen if she came across this. Oh well.  ***
