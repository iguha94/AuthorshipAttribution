Last night I watched the  Bourne Identity  and  Good Will Hunting . Both decent movies, but not brilliant. Matt Damon is nowhere as annoying as his buddy Ben Affleck in movies. There's just something about Affleck that makes me want to kick him in the gonads. Maybe I was traumatized by the Voyage of the Mimi in Ms. Babbish's class.  For the Bourne Identity, I can see why they're considering a sequel. I think it has potential. This movie could have had more depth, but it does sort of have the feel of introducing a character. Good Will Hunting was good, but watching it with commercial breaks on Bravo sort of killed the flow.  I still need to see  X2 , and I want to see the  Italian Job . Maybe when the  Hulk  comes out, I'll do a theater hop with Jon or something.  Or maybe not seeing as many movies is good, because then I'll have stuff to rent during the school year... and NetFlix is cheaper than going to the actual theater. I've always been more of the rent movies than go out and watch movies person. I like the privacy and food available... actually I think that's one of my favorite date things to do... rent a movie to watch with a fine young lady. It's been a while since I've done that as a date thing, since I haven't really met anyone I dig enough to invite over for that. I'm gonna stop before I get too emo.  So I'm waiting for Naomi N. for Disneyland... I haven't been there in ages... Walt is a fascist, but hey amusement parks are amusing.  ***
