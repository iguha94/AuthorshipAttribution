Being in NJ made me realize something. Sunlight has a big impact on my productivity and mood. Having sunlight enter your room in the morning really makes a big difference in getting your ass up out of bed at a respectable hour. Also it makes you feel less sluggish and energized. Note to self: make sure you have sunlight where you live next year!  Another couple of interesting things... well it looks like a certain someone will probably be going back to Nielsen, thus making my summer laboring quite awkward. Steff told me that the fact that I do think about "burying the hatchet" means that I don't feel like I have closure over the situation (I'm paraphrasing and interpreting here). I think... that is kind of true. Anyway... I'm feeling more curious than worried at this juncture about a lot of things concerning this... simply because the office is going through a lot of changes anyway.  Also I talked to someone from my past as well. It's been almost 2.5 years since I last talked to her. It was whatever... kind of weird though... I mean, the last time I talked to her, Clinton was still the president.  This stuff isn't really weighing on my mind though... more like making me go... hmm?  Oh yea, I rented the Punkorama DVD via NetFlix. It actually isn't bad, but not great like the CDs. A decent mix of old and new videos (made better by being able to turn the subtitles on for lyrics). The extras are alright. I think the history of Epitaph thing would have been better with some old photos not cheesy cartoons of Fletcher starting fires and being surrounded by cops. Oh and there's Greg and Brett on a row boat in Germany in 1992. Greg looks so lame in his stripped tube socks and Cornell hockey t-shirt. If I run into him in a few days when I visit Cornell (finally!) I'm gonna make fun of him... even more so if his hair is still slicked back.  ***
