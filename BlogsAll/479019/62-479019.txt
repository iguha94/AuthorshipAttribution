It's a bit past 5 and I think when I'm done with this post, I'll go take a nap before doing some reading.  There's a lot of new music out this week that I want. I want the new  Anti-Flag  and  Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros  CDs. Those are two artists that are new discoveries from the past few years that I've come to really like. Anti-Flag is pure political punk goodness and Joe Strummer is simply some good rock.  I remember when Joe Strummer died, I was disappointed because he had just been on stage with Mick Jones and there were rumblings that the Clash might reunite for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I also kicked myself for not going to see him and the Mescaleros complaining that $25 wasn't worth it. His death coincided with... something else. Let's just say the night following his death was an interesting night for me.  Something else I'd like to comment on is a conversation Cissa and I had yesterday. I think I can relate in some ways to her unhappiness, although in many ways I'm obviously different. I'm certainly unsatisfied with my environment and I can't say I'm happy. I too, don't know where I'm headed in life either. There is a voice inside of me that keeps saying, "What's the point of all this?" I mean, sure I  can  finish my phd. I know I can, but what happens then? Jobs are hard to come by, and the whole field of academia is a rough terrain. If I don't navigate it well enough, I could be stuck in a Binghamton-like town and be unhappy there as a continuance of the boredom of graduate school. There, too are days I just don't feel like getting up out of bed, because of a lack of motivation. I lack motivation, because the prize at the end of the tunnel isn't enticing enough.  I do like my classes and I do like what I'm working on in those classes. I just feel a lack of satisfaction in everyday life and it keeps me from focusing on my work.  **
