Here I am at school, at the HIRC. Killing time before my statistics discussion section.  Man... I was tired this morning! Despite dozing during RAW and going to bed around 12:45 AM, I was doing some serious nodding off in stats this morning. What was even worse was the guy sitting next to me kept raising his hand, which meant the professor had to be looking my way. That was totally annoying. The only amusing thing about the guy next to me was he kept hitting on the girl next to him. It was funny because she was trying to ignore him, despite his attempts to make conversation. Alas, the only thing that amuses me in that class are things like this.  Well anyway, after all that torture, I took a 30 minute nap in the basement of the Main Library like I normally do. Then I went to the pub for lunch, before heading to my mass communications class.  I like the pub, but the desire to have a beer during lunch at the begining of the quarter put a drain on my cash flow. Speaking of which I still need to pay my bills.  Lisa commented that she noticed that I was writing about a lot of stressful stuff in my blogs. She made a sarcastic remark about living with it, like she does. I think it was thought provoking, because of all the people I know, no one's life is more full of stress than hers. In addition to that, she handles it marvelously. I think her little comment was a bit of a reality check. Things could be a lot worse, and even if they were worse, it's something that can be worked through. So I'm feeling a bit better now, thanks to her.  Well now on to read some articles on coffee on the course webpage.  ***
