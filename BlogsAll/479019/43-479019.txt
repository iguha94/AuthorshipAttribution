[14507]  Last night I hung out with Evan, Viet, Danny, and George at Dave and Busters. The happy hour there is awesome.  I usually don't get any sort of hang over... but the bartender used shitty vodka for my Vodka Red Bulls and I think it's why I have this groggy feeling right now.   Work today and then Tomb Raider with the girls.  I'm amused at how my Friendster testimonials make me seem cooler than I really am. Actually, I'm kind of amused at how some people envy aspects of my life. I had a friend recently tell me that she envies how I'm living it up this summer. I guess what I've been doing this summer sounds cool, but it's not exactly healthy. Drinking a lot, abusing your body in the pit, have no set sleep schedule, etc. Also people seem to be impressed by the fact I go to school in NY state, but Binghamton isn't the most exciting place. I'm definately not as smart as some think I am. I'm certainly not the pimp I appear to be. Sure I'm around cool chicks all the time, but it's all platonic. Yes I'm a bit of a pyromaniac, and I can crush cans on my skull... but I'm a pretty cautious person when I do that stuff. I have the balls to jump from high places, yet lack the testicular fortitude for very simple things.  It's like all the stories and stuff I've done have created a persona that isn't necessarily the real me. You could say I have many layers... I guess what I'm getting at is that even my closest friends don't completely know me.   ***
