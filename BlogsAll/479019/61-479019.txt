[14939]  Maybe I'm getting old, but more mellow / interesting stuff seem to give me more pleasure these days. I managed to get 1 song from  Streetcore , "Coma Girl." It's a good song. It makes me hungry for more Strummer and the Mescaleros.   The new Anti-Flag CD is good, but I don't think it's as good as  Underground Network  or  A New Kind of Army . Could it be the touch Tom Morello of  Rage Against the Machine ?  Some of the songs seem to beckon for Zack de la Rocha's rapping more than Justin Sane's shrill battle cry with the rest of the band's anthem-like chants.  This seems more present in songs like "Postwar Breakout," which seems to recall the vibe of "The Panama Deception" from  Underground Network . "Sold as Freedom" seems to recall "Until It Happens To You." While the songs are different, there are some similarities in these early listenings. Anyway my favorite songs so far are "Turncoat," "Rank N File," and "O.I.L."  This hasn't been a very exceptional year for punk. Let's take a look at some of the full album acquisitions I've made this year.     Dropkick Murphys  -  Blackout  - This is by far my favorite album of the year. I give  Do or Die  a slight edge, but this album is amazing in a comparing apples and oranges kind of way. Both are tasty, but you have a preference. *****   Me First and the Gimme Gimmes  -  Take A Break  - This album is so much fun, as all their albums are. ****    NOFX  -  War on Errorism  - Nothing brilliant, but a good album that is fun and has a lot of thought put into it. ****    A.F.I.  -  Sing the Sorrow  - A very good album, and is one of their more solid over-all albums. ****   Pennywise  -  From the Ashes  - Incredibly generic. **   Rancid  -  Indestructible  - This album is a joke and is a stain upon Rancid's discography. *   Randy  -  Welfare Problems  - Eh? It just didn't click like their other albums. *   Anti-Flag  -  The Terror State  - See above for comments. ***   Ozma  -  Spending Time on the Boderline  - Some good songs, but it's not really completely new as some of those songs, they've been playing live for years. ***   T(I)NC  -  Bigger Cages, Longer Chains  [EP] - Good stuff, but there's a reason why these songs didn't make it onto  A New Morning, Changing Weather . ***   The Moving Units  -  Self Titled  [EP] - A couple of songs and decent. ***   AM Radio  -  Radioactive  - Overrated with one or 2 good tracks, but lots of unlistenable tracks. **   Here's some stuff I don't have the whole album, but some general impressions:     Joykiller  -  Ready Sexed Go  - So far so good, but not 5 star.   Lost Patrol  -  Songs About Running Alway  - I think it will be very good, potential 5 star.   Rooney  -  Self-Titled  - Not really my thing, but is listenable.   The Ataris  -  So Long Astoria  - I'd say most likely a 3.   Motion City Soundtrack  -  I Am The Movie  - Some very good songs, but a lot of the songs are kind of annoying.   Manic Hispanic  -  Mijo Goes to Jr. College  - I'd say most likely a 3. You can't too wrong with covers. I've only heard Code Brown though.   Brand New  -  Deja Entendu  - Emo on Epitaph... all the emo kids seem to be really into them right now. I don't plan on downloading more than I already have, if that's any indication of my opinion.   White Stripes  -  Elephant  - If only Jack's voice wasn't as bad as Billy Corgan's.   The Mars Volta  -  De-Loused in Comatorium  - I don't see the appeal whatsoever.   The Raveonettes  -  Self Titled  - I've heard worse.   Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros  -  Streetcore  - I think it will be brilliant.
