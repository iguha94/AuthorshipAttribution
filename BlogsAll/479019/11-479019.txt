Its 2:30 AM and I have class at 9. Im either having a hard time going to sleep due to my 4 hours nap and the coffee I had, or due to having a lot on my mind. Ive been reflecting a lot on who I am right now as opposed to who I was several years ago. I guess its fitting since I graduate in a few weeks. Ive come to the realization that Im much more cynical and foreboding now than I ever was in the past. I dont really think thats a good thing.  Its a materialistic world out there. So I just stopped caring as a response. Ive realized that and I find myself to be a cold individual right now as a result of that or at least on the inside. I still go out and have fun with friends. I still enjoy life; however, on the inside many of my desires and ideals have stopped burning brightly. I think thats why the thought of an enduring romantic relationship seems ridiculous to me. Thats probably why I found that stuff in the films Ive been watching to be meaningless. Thats probably why Im feeling so apathetic right now about grad school and my future. I wouldnt say that Im pessimistic to the point of not having hope at all, but simply at this juncture, I have no lofty dreams like I did several years ago.   Thats pretty much my ramble. I should try to go to bed again.  *
