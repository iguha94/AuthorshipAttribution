[14512]  Who are the 5 people who visit my blog consistently? Mike has admitted to wanting to keep an eye on me... you stalker! I know Nai and Suzanne visit from time to time, but who are the others? Laine maybe?  Oh yea... I should probably explain my counter to y'all who don't know. I've been using the same counter for years and I've accumulated a lot of hits over the past 5 years or so? It's cause I used to host a large wrestling image gallery and I had an extremely popular Winamp 2x skin. I made the first 5 star university themed skin!  Work was cool yesterday. Tania's fun to work with. She's a cool chick, it's hard to believe she's a mom. Last night Naomi, Andy, and I were talking about how it's weird to hear that people are getting married... much less have kids. I guess it's even harder to imagine when most of your friends are single. Of my friends who I consider close, Kaho and Flo (that rythmes!) are the only ones in relationships. Oh... I almost forgot Mike and Cissa. Mike would probably get on my case if I didn't list him as close friend... right Mike? Anyway... I'm not one that really feels lonely anymore, thus my contentment with singularity. I think the last time was early 2001 after the rather long relationship and series of dating. I really owe not being lonely to friends and good music... 'cause in 2001 I saw some killer shows and made some awesome friends! It did cross my mind that down the line... it'll be weird as friends start getting married off or even start to be in long term relationships recently.   Anyway... last night Naomi, Andy and I... and later Brandon hung out at Godfather's. Social D, Weezer and Bad Religion on the jukebox... that's good shit.  PPV later tonight?  ****
