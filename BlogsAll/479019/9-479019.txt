Ah... nothing like a nice shower after being covered in the sweat of punks and skanks at a show...  Man... the show was awesome. It's been a good four years since I've seen  Rancid  and  NOFX ... so it was great to see them live. Their sets were pretty good except for NOFX going a little overboard on their slow satirical jazzy reggae style songs. The Real McKenzies were cool too. I'm totally down for bagpipe punk in the same vein of the  Dropkick Murphys . F-Minus wasn't very good though. It was also cool in the NOFX covered Rancid's "Olympia, WA" and Rancid covered NOFX's "Bob." Tim Armstrong had this big grin on his face and even chuckled a bit during that song. It was pretty cool.   If a certain Canadian friend of my is reading this, she must be foaming with jealousy over such a great show. I bet that'd be kicked up a few notches when I tell her that Unwritten Law is playing next Friday at my school for free! I just found that out today.   In other news not completely involving music, although it was an epiphany in bettwen NOFX's and Rancid's set... I realized my life is right where I want it to be. Going to awesome shows with good friends, doing really fun research at school (despite the headaches of being in the library too long), having fun and drinking with the boys (and sometimes girls), watching TV shows I like, art projects, etc. Life is good.   ****
