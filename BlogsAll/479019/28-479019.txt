I've noticed a few people in various places claim that there is such a thing as meritocracy, that is people on top are there from working hard... especially in regards millionaires and elected officials.  I'm willing to admit that most of the old corporations of the United States that started in the 19th and early 20th centuries were a realization of the "American Dream." Poor immigrants who came to this country to find success and all that good stuff. However, how many poor immigrants ended up in slums and were forced to deal with anti-Semitism and racism? For ever success, there were thousands of failures. It should be noted that no minority ever gained the wealth comparable to the Rockefellers, studio heads, etc. (Until celebrities started making absurd amounts of money) Yet Africans, Chinese and Japanese were here longer than Eastern and South European immigrants. For the "white" people who "failed" and minorities, did they just not work as hard as the people who did make it?  The myth of meritocracy, to Marxist theorists, is a veil that disguises the institutional inequalites that perpetuates the class status of the elite. It's the whole, "People are rich and powerful, because they worked for it," rationale. Does the labor of a single mother working 2 jobs to feed and support her kids mean less than the work of an executive who's father founded the company? This system exploits the labor of the poor. Not just domestically, but internationally. Some say... "If corporations didn't go to 3rd World Countries, then people wouldn't have jobs." Jobs are one thing, but putting them in a system of little social mobility is another.  Is it a coincidence that our elected officials come from some of the richest families in the country?   Just a little rant... I should finish my reading on the Haitian Revolution.  ***
