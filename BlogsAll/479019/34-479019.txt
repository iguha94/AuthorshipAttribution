So last night I went to the TASC banquet. It was alright. The food was decent and some of the performances were good too. I saw Nick there and got a ride home from him. He's a cool guy that might be fun to hang out with more... although it was kind of weird him suggesting that I  meet  one of his students.   Damn the city bus today... so I was waiting at the bus stop at 1:20 PM so I could go get some pastrami, beer, and whatever... well I gave up on waiting and the bus didn't get there until 1:45. I gave up, because the bus heading home leave the stop near Giant at the hour... that leaves me either no time to shop or I'll have to wait forever to get home. Oh well I guess being at home gave me a chance to lend an ear to Michelle and Steff on their guy troubles / issues.   Hmm maybe continuing the negativity... the AA MOTW has some really horrific images of the AIDS epidemic in Southeast Asia and Africa. It was less than a week ago that Wataru and I were discussing what a fucked up situation it is. Sure we were joking that the CIA was using AIDS as population control to keep those peoples from revolting... but seriously the MOTW made a good point about how all of suddent people are talking about SARS in rich countries. While AIDS research has increased, aid is being given to Africa, etc. It has to be understood that it takes more than just medicine to solve the problems in these areas of the world. The social relations as well has political / economic structures of these places have disintegrated to the point that AIDS has been able to run rampant. Our media in the developed world never mentions how we have a hand in the destruction of these societies in terms of monetary policy and stuff. Ok... I'll just stop... no need to write a massive paper...  It is a beautiful day out by the way...  ***
