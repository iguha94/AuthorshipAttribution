For an explanation on posts from 2001, click    here  .  [12.12.01]  It`s been a long time since I`ve put anything new here.  But here I am... back... schools out and I need something to do.  Anyway... life is alright for me these days aside from a bit of boredom. It seems like my only ambition right now is to find some solace from the ideas running around in my head. Which means I`m not really doing anything physically and just sitting on my *bleep* most of the time.  Oh yes... before I go... I`ll mention that I`ve downloaded all of Bad Religion`s upcoming album The Process of Belief (2002). A brilliant album. It`s their fastest and probably most religious album ever. Honestly, for a band called Bad Religion, they never really sang about religion very much. They`ve tended to sing mostly about society and science (after all Greg Graffin is a scientist). However a lot of their songs on this album deal with belief and religion. Even the song of the moment ... "Sorrow" ... has a lot of metaphors and brings up issues that have long been theological ones. All I can say is interesting timing...  Here are the lyrics for y`all  Father can you hear me? How have I let you down? I curse the day that I was born... And all the sorrow in this world...  Let me take you to the hurting ground Where all good men are trampled down Just to settle a bet that could not be won Between a prideful father and his son Will you guide me now, for I can`t see A reason for the suffering and this long misery What if every living soul could be upright and strong  Well, then I do imagine... There will be Sorrow Yeah there will be Sorrow And there will be Sorrow, no more  When all soldiers lay their weapons down Or when all kings and all queens relinquish their crowns Or when the only true messiah rescues us from ourselves  It`s easy to imagine... There will be Sorrow Yeah there will be Sorrow And there will be Sorrow, no more  ***   [11.21.01]   Sick as a dog... day 2   *
