I went to the modernism discussion, but not the lecture. The 8 hours of class are just too much.  Netflix says that they never got  Memento  back. Hmm... I mailed it... I hope it doesn't mean that someone jacked it? Well I just watched  Chocolat . Great movie... it's interesting. The modernism class really makes me examine the aspects of modernism in movies and life around me a lot more. How is Chocolat modern you might ask? There certainly is a battle between the traditional life that's very Victorian and the modern sensibilities that Vianne brings to the town. It's the idea that how you live life is an important aspect of living a good life. There's the notion of having the freedom to make your life a good one. I think there's an aspect of consumerism in it though. The fact that a specific commodity - chocolate - is what brings meaning to the lives of the people says something about how the film has modernist themes.  Now of course... I had a question that was brought up by Prof. Elbert's discussion about home decor. From what I remember from another history class... the Victorian home had "souvenirs" that one gathered from things that you did. It can be argued that the Rothko replica was a souvenir, in that is has a "memory" to it. It is true that its value as an original is gone as it is a replica that would later be replicated again in a film. How is "memory" different in the Victorian era, from the Modern era?  In rotation lately has been some old school punk...  X  and  Dead Kennedys .  ***
