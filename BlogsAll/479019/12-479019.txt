I did manage to go to the movies today. I watched  Episode II  and  Spiderman . Both were in my opinion extremely good movies. As for my brother's statement about  Spiderman  being better? That's arguable. To me both movies were so incredibly different that it's hard to compare. True both are familiar, science-fiction / action films; however, they serve different purposes. It's clear that  Episode II  is part of a larger series of movies. There's a lot of linking and tying in of plot and characters of what will be all 6 movies. That means there's a lot of stuff going on. Actually after watching it twice, I picked up on a lot of the linking stuff. It's almost overwhelming how much they pack in.  Spiderman  is one movie with a straighforward single plot. In a way I liked how  Episode II  kept me thinking and tying things together. However, I liked how  Spiderman  was just a great simple movie, that only briefly focused on how there could be sequel. Visually,  Episode II  was better; however, sometimes it did seem too much. I dunno... if it was a competition, I'd give it a tie.  Anyway... after the movies, Jon and I had some Del Taco and then I dropped him off. I pretty much went home and slept for 4 hours. Talk about a lazy ass eh? Well I did manage to catch 2nd hour of the finale of X-files, do my Soc Sci 3a stuff and get up to 10 pages done of my history paper. That's 66% done! Woohoo.  Things to do for tomorrow:  Go to class.  Turn in my Soc Sci 3a assignment  Get my insurance thing stamped.  Use my $25 gift certificate at Quicksilver... I'll probably get some shorts or something.  Go to yoga.  Work on my paper.  Watch RAW.    Hmm... I haven't been listening to much music lately so nothing in rotation for the past few days. I guess with my new spindle of CDs I should make myself a new CD.  ***
