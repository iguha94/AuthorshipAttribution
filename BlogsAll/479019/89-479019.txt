[15669]   So yesterday I got up at 7 and was on campus around 8:30 to scan some stuff.   Photos  have been uploaded. Then I had a somewhat interesting, but very crowded and clausterphobic class. After school I picked up my TV tuner from the apartment office and set it up. However, the attenna I got from Radio Shack only allows me to get ABC... which sucks. The only station I really wanted was FOX. So I had to order cable and I need to return the attenna.  Last night I went out to eat with Wataru, Tami, and Chi-Wei at the Texas Roadhouse. It was good and the price wasn't bad. I think we should go there instead of the overpriced Hooters from now on... although Wataru is going back to Japan, so I don't know who will be going next time.  Afterwards, I got dropped off at my place and watched  Escape from LA . I thought it was better than  Escape from NY . I really do! And that's not just to annoying Nancy and Melissa...  LA  is just more fun!  Then Inhye and I went to the Belmar and did some drinking there. It was cool. Saw Wataru again there, along with Melanie and Kristina (in addition to all the usual grad students). Afterwards we chilled at my place until pretty late (early).  A little ramble about stuff...   I honestly don't know what I want in life right now. I just still feel unsatisfied with so much. It's a little bit better with work to do and the fact I've been working out... but... I dunno... I'm missing a lot of the things that make me who I am here. Maybe that  Pennywise  show in a few weeks will cheer me up?  Other randomness... 4:30 AM is not a peak hour for coordination of mental and physical activities.... ABC sucks... 5 hrs of sleep suck... lack of practice of any activity sucks...  ***
