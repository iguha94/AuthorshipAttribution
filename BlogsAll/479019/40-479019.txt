My highlight for the day is Erica's testimonial on my Friendster account. It reminded me of the good old days at Santiago Hills. Those were some good memories. We were pretty darn good friends in elementary school. And Erica if you're reading this... I too am really really happy we got back in touch.   Oh and what's even more interesting is at a party earlier tonight I ran into the sister of some dude I knew from those days too.  I remember that last year, this whole running into people who know me or that know of me or that I know someone that they know thing was well overwhelming. It made me want to really get the fuck out of Irvine. I remember that night too... it was on Steff's birthday last year. It was just so weird seeing people (who by the way were friends of Erica's back in those days) after almost a decade. This time around it's really sentimental, because I realized that Irvine is... as Evan once put it... home. The fact that at this party I talked to people that I had met at shows and know people I know was cool. It's really a small fucking world. It's like John knowing Dan, Esther knowing Kelly's boyfriend's cousin, or me having met people from people's pasts. As I used to joke with Laine... I'm the center of the universe.  I just tossed around a lot of names... but for the next little section... I just want to say that a recent conversation I had with someone was pretty darn therapeutic. In that I feel like there's a clean slate... ok well it's not really back to square one, zero, or whatever cliche phrase there is out there... but there was stuff I got off my chest that had been pent up for a while. It wasn't anything bad that was pent up, but it was simply some sentiments that feel a lot better out in the open than forever buried deep away. It's nice to tell someone exactly what's on your mind. I think we took what was said well.  ***
