I went for a run this morning and then made mysel some potatoes and eggs for breakfast... I'm kind of tired right now.  Over at my   Xanga  page I've been collecting new quotes to be added to my quote of the day javascript for this page. Right now I have the script alternating between 2 files with 31 quotes for odd and even months. However, I'm going to be sticking in a third file so that it alternates between 3 files. That means it'll be 3 months before a quote is repeated. I doubt anyone comes to my page daily, but you never know. The script might become super useful some day.  Today I'm just going to sit around and get some reading done. I should try to get Prigogine done today. It's do-able. I've read 100 pages in a day before... hell I've done more than that. Also, Thelma is supposed to call about my updated work schedule sometime today. Also George and I are suppose to do some grilling of meat later.   Oh yea... looks like I'll be seeing 3 shows in a 1 week span of time next month!  6/10 -  Alkaline Trio  &  One Man Army  @ Canes 6/12 -  Dropkick Murphys  @ Key Club 6/17 -  AM Radio  & Rooney @ HOB Anaheim... to celebrate Steff's Birthday.  Now playing  Offspring 's "Get it Right" from  Ignition .  ***
