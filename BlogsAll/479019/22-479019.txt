I've been really weak on the blog updates haven't I? Well I've been really busy with 2 papers, which I've thankfully turned in already. Nothing really exciting this weekend due to that.  Let's see... what is new? I got a new mirror today! Hayes decided to install new mirrors in their old buildings. Not that I'm vain or fashionable, but it's nice to make sure there's no lint to other crap on your body before you go out.  I've been playing Fallout 1 and 2 again. I swear Fallout 2 is perhaps one of the most brilliant RPGs of all time. Interplay should get their act together and start work on Fallout 3. Seriously! There are so many Easter eggs in Fallout 2 that everytime I play it, I discover something new. Most recently I discovered that if mention that you stained the Cat's Paw magazines that you're delivering to Miss Kitty, she notices that one of the magazines has an article on energy weapons.   Looks like I'll be doing my research paper for 620 on Canada's plight in globalization... Any advice from Canadian readers?  Finally... it's really cool that Julia's been sending me pictures of all the stuff that the girls have been doing. It's nice seeing pictures of people you care about having fun and living life. Hah... if I had a digital camera, I'd be sending them all pictures of lots of drunk grad students.  In rotation recently has been Millencolin.  ***
