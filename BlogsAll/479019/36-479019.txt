Here I am at work... bored and tired. Man... no one is picking up the phone. So I got through all the work with like no appointments set.  I'm tired cause last night I went to the Liquid Lounge in HB with a bunch of folks to send off Flo, before she goes to Texas. Ya know what...  club environments are really annoying for some reason. The artificiality of the whole thing, music I don't like, and I dunno... it was pretty boring at some points. At other points when I was socializing with my buds and other folks, it was cool. Oh and the nipples... yea I saw a lot of nipples that night, between the soft core porn on the screen, the girl flashing the DJ, and girls there dancing in revealing outfits. I think I enjoyed the glimpse of areola on the redhead the most. Other interesting stuff was Naomi and Flo getting really fucked up, and this really cheesy dude hitting on Flo all night.  I got some props on my mohawk too. The bouncer asked me if the mohawk is a New York thing, as he'd never seen an Asian with one before. Also this girl named Marissa (I think) that I came across randomly seemed to really dig the mohawk and my "look." She's all like, "I can tell you're a whatever kind of guy and you don't really give a fuck." She was cool, she was gonna buy me a drink, but alas my friends were leaving. I don't know if she was right about my confidence level, because I think I'm more of an alter ego at times than the real me.  Afterwards we went to Norms and that cheesy dude wouldn't stop with the lame comments. I got home around 3:30 AM.  Being bored is kind of a bad thing for me, because then I get crazy ideas in my head. I was having people punch me in the face last night.  Actually everyone was being a wimp about it. It was kind of fun regardless. To feel the "madness" again. I used to have a reputation as one of the toughest and craziest SOBs around in high school and part of college. Alas I don't have that edge anymore.  ***
