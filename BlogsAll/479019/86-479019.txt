[15249]  So last night I had dinner with Melissa. Then we watched  Ferris Bueller's Day Off  and  South Park . It was a nice evening. I had fun, because she's cool.   I hadn't watched  Ferris Bueller's Day Off  in years... it's such a classic.  Today I lounged around for a long time, before finally going to campus to get work done. I returned a couple of books and then did some editting on my  Planet of the Apes  paper. It's getting closer to where I'm satisfied with it. The end just needs a bit more work.   I did some editing on my methods paper also. I didn't bring any readings with me, but I think I'll conclude it with something from Alford on rigor to finish it off when I get home.   Art History 550E: 10/10 (Dec. 15)  Art History 572F: 17/17 (Dec. 10)  Sociology 607: 12/18 (Dec. 16)  Sociology 616: 12/20 (Dec. 11)  Totals: 51 / 65 = 78.4%  Remaining: 14 pages / approx. 10 days = 1.4 per day ~ with some buffer   I guess I'm going to go to the GSO party tonight. Inhye offered a ride so I guess that makes it more worth my while to go to. Otherwise, I was going to stay home and watch  Gone in 60 Seconds  and  Roman Holiday  (a classic that I've never seen). I think instead I'll watch just one of the movies with my dinner and watch the other tomorrow.  ***
