My brother got pissed off at me after I made a few comments about his dating of film noir as the 1950s and his review of Matrix Revolutions. He said I have a big ego and Ive always been like this growing up. He said that I should think about this and how it affects people Im supposed to care about.   All I can say is whatever. I admit to having a big ego. I know I am a self-centered ass and you know what? Im perfectly happy being an egoist since I think I deserve my arrogance. Ive done a lot in my life on my own. I for the most part like who I am. Ive always been someone that preferred doing his own thing or doing things his own way. It's gotten me pretty far in life. Does that make me an egoist? Sure whatever. Thats why Ive had so many problems with my (our) parents. So sue me for being a strong individual.   Yea I'm an ass... that doesn't mean I don't give a shit about my brothers feelings, but me being an egoist, thinks he's overreacting over something insignificant... this I don't feel justified in feeling bad.  Hey Ill admit that I havent been the best of big brothers, and that a lot of the shit I pulled growing up spilled heat over onto him. I'll even admit he's been a better brother to me than vice versa. That Im sorry for, but this is a petty argument. (Yes arrogance shining through again). Hes acting like how my (our) parents would react over something so petty. If that comment offends him, eh deal with it. If I can make our mom cry without remorse, will blocking me on AIM really get to me? Sorry, but Im myself and dont plan on changing.  *
