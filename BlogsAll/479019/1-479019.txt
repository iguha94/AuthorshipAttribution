For an explanation on posts from 2001, click    here  .  5/8 -  As those of you who have been here before might have noticed, I am once again playing around with the design of my page. I call this constant need to play with my page competitive creativity its the fire within me to constantly out do myself (and others). On to something interesting that I observed today at school that made me ask many questions. In front of the school around noon there were two groups of people making use of their right to free speech. To the left of me were leftists, who were rallying against police brutality and talking about Mumia, while to the right of me were right wing Christian fundamentalists preaching the word of God. As I stood there in the middle, I thought to myself that although I lean to the left in my political beliefs, the people around me are people who believe in universal truths, whether about God, human rights, the role of the government I, on the other hand, do not believe in universal truths. One might describe me as a nihilist. I believe that nothing is truly objective and everything is subjective; therefore, what truly is truth if everything is subject to how we perceive the world? If nothing is true, then why should I care about God or Mumia getting executed?  5/6 - Despite waiting a while in line and missing Midtown and Thrice... I did manage to see the International Noise Conspiracy. As my brothers and sisters would say up north by the bay... it was "hella cool." The band put on an awesome show and I can`t wait to see them again.*****  5/5 - Yay it`s the weekend! Too bad it`s going to be a weekend of studying and thinking about what to do my term paper on for one of my sociology classes. However, I am looking forward to seeing the International Noise Conspiracy. That will most likely be the highlight of my weekend. Stayed tuned for a show review.***  5/3 - Nothing incredibly profound today. I`m taking a day off from social commentary and giving you a song of the moment instead. That song is the Vandals` "People That Are Going to Hell" from their Hitler Bad, Vandals Good CD (1998).  5/2 - Yesterday I left my thoughts on people who are uncreative and chose to demonstrate their sameness rather than individuality. Although in western civilization we stress individuality as an ideal, in practice how much of an individual are any of us? How bad do you want to fit in at the expense of what you really want? How often do you "discover" something cool for yourself instead of listening to others? I leave these questions for you all to think about.***  5/1 - I just had to mention how redundant it is for someone to have "azn" in their name on AA. I probably wouldn`t have noticed it if it was just a few uncreative people, but there sure is a lot of them out there. Then again maybe these people care more about being the same as another person rather than being an individual.*  4/30 - I spent the weekend doing field research for my sociology class. A lot of interesting stuff came up and if you ask I`d be happy to tell you about it. Aside from that, I put up some new pics on my website. Y`all can see them HERE. Other than that the most interesting thing of the weekend was my purchase of two new band t-shirts.***  4/29 - My buddy Kowloon2dx and I was discussing the perpetuation of online obnoxiousness last night with someone in a chat room. Our point of argument was that one does not have to be like everyone else and treat a chat room as a "meat market" or be an immature jerk. The cyber world has so much potential as a forum to share thoughts and make new friends, but unforuntately so many people make it a place of pervs and a$$holes. I think that people shold realize that despite the cyber world being a virtual world, that they are still dealing with real people; therefore, politness and sincerity is still very much appreciated.**  4/27 - Nothing particularly exciting going on in my life except for the fact I`ve been working and going to school. I`m jealous of everyone on semester system who gets out of school in a few weeks while I`m stuck in school for over a month. Anyway... the song of the moment is the Descendents` Rotting Out from their Everything Sucks CD (1996). ****  4/24 - The website of the moment is http://astrology.yahoo.com/. Check out the palmistry section on the page. It got me pretty accurate except for the parts where I couldn`t figure out which mount is most prominent on my hand.****  4/23 - A rather uneventful weekend (no offense to anyone I hung out with this weekend). Work, essay writing, with some leisure time to share with my friends and computer. Speaking of spending time with my computer, I`ve been playing around with the layout of my page. I hope all of you like it.***  4/20 - It`s 4:20! Hah cool. Well anyway the painting of the moment is Night Cafe (1888) by Vincent Van Gogh. It`s one of my favorite Van Gogh paintings.****  4/18 - As some of you know, Joey Ramone, a member of one of the founding punk rock groups passed away this past Sunday. So in honor of him the song of the moment is "Sheena is a Punk Rocker" from the Ramones` Rocket to Russia CD (1977).  4/17 - The movie of the moment is Amadeus (1984). A great movie that has quality acting, good music, and well written.*****  4/16 - Wow, 2 weeks down and 8 weeks of school left to go. I`m already feeling unmotivated. I need to kick it up a notch as Emmeril would say. "BAM!" Let`s hope the Sufferboy can get his GPA up this quarter.**  4/15 - The song of the moment is Ignite`s Veteran from their "A Place Called Home" CD (2000). This is a totally awesome song that kicks major tail. "Where are we, where are we now?" *****  4/13 - The link of the moment is www.wrestlecrap.com. It`s the perfect site for any old school pro wrestling fan.**** 4/11 - The painting of the moment is Lavender Mist by Jackson Pollock (1950). Abstract Expressionism rules!.*****  4/10 - Hah... no supervisors at work today. I got to slack off so much today. I barely did anywork today.***  4/9 - More random ramblings... I hear the International Noise Conspiracy is going to play at Chain Reaction in May. That should be interesting. Iwonder if I should try to interview them for my sociology paper.***  4/7 - Some random ramblings... Week 2 @ UCI is just about to start. Thus far my classes seem interesting, but hard. It looks like I`ll have to be pumping out some massive amounts of writing this quarter. Fun wouldn`t you say?*  4/6 - The song of the moment is Social Distortion`s "Don`t Drag Me Down" from their White Light, White Heat, White Trash CD (1996). "Your history books are full oflies..." *****  4/5 - The movie of the moment is Conan the Barbarian (1982) starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, because I too seek the answer to the Riddle of Steel (aka the meaning of life). ****  4/4 - Link of the moment is www.obeygiant.com. You can get those Andre the Giant stickers that you see all over the place and be part of the posse.*****  4/3 - The painting of the moment is Night Hawks (1942) by Edward Hopper. It`s a great painting that is currently being used as my Windows wallpaper. If you have the time, I encourage you all to check it out. *****  4/2 - Wrestlemania was simply an amazing PPV. My Olympic hero Kurt Angle did an awesome job returning to his amateur roots. Another cool thing was Stone Cold Steve Austin being stone cold again. Best PPV I`ve seen in a while. *****   4/1 - Wrestlemania is today. "The grand daddy of `em all" as Jim Ross likes to call it. I`m hoping that my favorite wrestler Kurt Angle beats Chris Benoit, but we`ll all see in a matter of hours won`t we?   3/31 - The song of the moment is from Pennywise`s About Time CD (1995). Pennywise seems to love to use the word "day" in their lyrics, but they mange to use it really well. The song is track #1, Peaceful Day. "Tell me how to make it through the day." *****  3/30 - The movie of the week is Bill and Ted`s Excellent Adventure (1989). The Wyld Stallyns totally rule. Bill S. Preston Esquire and Ted "Theodore" Logan are simply amazing dudes!*****  3/29 - I basically spent the last 2 days working on my page. I hope you all enjoy it.  3/26 - I saw Propagandhi, Avail, and J-Church last night. Propagandhi is a cool band and Ilike what they have to say, but their live performances and music lacks something. Avail had a lot of energy, and the lead singer of J-Church looks like he got booted off the set of Kung Fu: The Legend Continues. ***
