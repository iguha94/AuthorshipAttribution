[14945]  That's 2 days in a row of some working out. I remember when I used to be able to do sets of 50 push ups and do like 200 in one session. That was between my junior and senior years of high school. Of course I was 30 lbs lighter and in good shape then. I right now I'm doing 3 sets of 20ish per setting. Crunches I used to practically go forever. It was ridiculous to count, as I'd just go until I was tired. Now it's something like 200 a session. Maybe I'll get some weights tomorrow after I return my books. I think it was late last year that Hueter commented on how I used to be a rock and didn't have an ounce of fat on me. I used to be much tougher than I am now. I want my toughness back.  After I go shower, I'm going to go through my ILL books since they're due tomorrow. Fuck I hate Binghamton's library. I was bitching about how the UCI Main Library got renamed to the Langson Library, but now I see the importance of selling out. We need books damn it!  This weekend I have 3 objectives. I need to get my 602 papers done. I've been saying that for months now, but I'm serious about that. At least 1 of the 2 need to get done this weekend. I also need to get chunks of my 2 art history papers thought out. I'll probably do some tonight, since I need to return books tomorrow.  There's a hottie that I've run into 3 days in a row now. That's a good thing.  ***
