Last night I slept for 13 hours!  It was glorious as it was a really nice sleep. I think the combination of a hurt back and beer had something to do with it.  Yea I have a hurt back. I didn't bend at the knees, when picking something up. It was just a few books too. Nothing heavy. Hopefully the booze I will drink tonight will ease the pain.  I have a shitload of work to do. I need to get cracking on my paper for 607, actually read all the books I checked out, and do readings for my classes. Yea fun fucking stuff!  I'm looking forward meeting up with Steff, Nai, and Julia next week in NYC. Partying with my lady friends on a distant place once again. We've done London, Edinburgh, LA, and now New York City. This will rock. Also the meeting of boardies should be most excellent as well.   My plan for tonight and the next few days:    TODAY:  Go home, do some writing, make dinner (teriyaki chicken?), go to party.  TOMORROW:  Go to campus and study, go to TASC movie thing.  SUNDAY:   I really need to get my incomplete for 602 done.  MONDAY:   Get shit done! Read for classes mostly.   Oh yea and  Lost Patrol  is addicting. Dennis Lyxzn is the fucking man. Refused, The (International) Noise Conspiracy, and Lost Patrol are so different yet so good. It's like the perfect buffet.  ***
