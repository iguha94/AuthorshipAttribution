Ok... so I figured out what was causing my computer to freeze. It turns down it was an update from the Windows update webpage. The question is which one? I did a system restore to approximately 2:13 PM today removing a set up of updates and driver updates. I debating whether or not to try to narrow down the specific update.  I have about 110 pages left of the Kriedte book left. I probably should get cracking on it rather than playing around online... oh well... 19 hrs is plenty of time to finish it. Right?  I really need to get to work on my paper on constitutionalism... You know what? I should really stick to the targets I set for myself. Stuff like waking up early, getting stuff done, etc. Especially stuff I don't necessarily want to do, but have to do. I manage to get stuff of little or no importance done (like the remodelling of this page)... and it's not so much eating away at productivity time, but rather should set an example for what I can get done if I really set my mind to it.  I'm debating whether or not I should purchase some  One Man Army  stuff from the Adeline Records webpage. They're an awesome opening band... I've seen them twice opening for NUFAN and TSOL. They've got a new album coming out on BYO, which has the Anti-Flag / Bouncing souls split album, which I really want! I don't know if I can justify the costs, when I should be spending money on necessities (I don't have any snow clothes yet).  Oh well...  ***
