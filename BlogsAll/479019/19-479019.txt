My schedule.... work today... go to Fuddruckers with George and then drink. Tomorrow... see Rowdy Roddy Piper at the Galaxy with Derek. Friday, work and say good-bye to George and Samantha. Saturday work half day and then go to  LACMA  and dinner with the girls. Sunday, watch movies with Linda.   Here's something I put up on the AA Rockers message board in response to how Pink isn't punk.   RE: RE: RE: anyone can be punk rock...  I personally don't like how the popular media whores the notion "punk." I read an article on  XXX  in the LA Times and it talked about the punk rock image. That would make sense as the movie involves a lot of extreme sports and extreme sports and punk have long had a strong bond, if it wasn't for the fact that the only involvement of punk rock in the movie is Vin Diesel's reference to the  Vandals . The sound track is all nu-metal and rap-rock with no punk. The same could be said about how the media talks about Avril Lavigne.  I'll be the first to admit that the term punk is a broad term. If you look at music history... new wave, goth rock grew out of the punk scene in the late 70s and early 80s. Look at some of the big bands we have today...  Social D  is labeled punk, but they sound very country.  AFI  and TSOL have a goth tinge to them.  Bad Religion  has large collection of folk rock-ish songs. What I think ties them all together is the punk scene and inspiration. From the scenes of LA/ Orange County  suburbs, to NY's CBGBs, to Gilman Street and being inspired by bands like the  Clash , Sex Pistols, and X.   The lineage behind bands and artists on the XXX soundtrack such as Rammstein, Drowning Pool, Moby and Nelly are totally different. Therefore they aren't punk.   Pink defineately isn't punk   I'm hungry now... time for lunch.  ***
