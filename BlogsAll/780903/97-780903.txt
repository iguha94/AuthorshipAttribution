“It’s the Bluebook” (to the tune of “Copacabana”)  I thought a footnote, was just a footnote Italicized a little there, and lots of commas everywhere Supras and infras, see and see generally It isn’t just a guide Footnoting keeps me satisfied Abbreviations for the states, what the editor reads when he masturbates I know all ninety-seven rules And you wonder why I can’t get dates  It’s the bluebook, the holy bluebook So torn up that I bought a new book It’s the bluebook, the holy bluebook Abbreviations for two hundred nations It’s the bluebook... I fell in love.  I had this journal, it was infernal Four thousand pages all in Dutch, the ink was melting at the touch The rule was sixteen, on page one-eighteen It told me what I had to do, Oh bluebook I’m in love with you And my line editor said that ‘cause I did this I was through  But I want more cause I love the process Give me rule 18-point-2.  It’s the bluebook, the holy bluebook So torn up that I bought a new book It’s the bluebook, the holy bluebook One short citation, oh what a sensation It’s the bluebook... I fell in love.  Now there’s a pamphlet, but there’s no author But I’ve got rule 15.1, the Bluebook makes my evenings fun Page 107.  Now I’m in heaven Cause I just love these caps so small Next to parentheses so tall The 3rd edition -- check, let’s add a comma, what the heck. I am the master of the cite Nothing else to do at night  It’s the bluebook, the holy bluebook So torn up that I bought a new book It’s the bluebook, the holy bluebook Let me revise it, so everyone buys it It’s the bluebook... I fell in love.
