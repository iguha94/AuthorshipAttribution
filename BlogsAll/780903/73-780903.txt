Just saw a commercial for "High School Reunion" (yes, I'm watching way too much WB... but I kind of like the show "Everwood" for no articulable reason), a show that takes 17 people who graduated from high school 10 years ago and flies them to Hawaii to re-live old conflicts and make good dramatic reality TV.  On the website, they label each person -- "The Bully," "The Bitchy Girl," "The Loner."  Why, why, why, why, why would anyone agree to be on a show like this?  Is the week of fame they'll have before the show is cancelled really worth being forever known as "The Bitchy Girl?"  The next commercial was for "The Surreal Life," another reality show, where 7 B-list celebrities live together Real World-style.  Corey Feldman, Gabrielle Carteris (from Beverly Hills 90210), and 5 others.  This one I guess I understand why these people would agree to do this -- they've already been semi-famous once, and they miss it.  And it's a paycheck.  Imagine combining the two shows -- B-list celebrities at a high school reunion.  I wonder what Pamela Anderson was like in high school. Did she even go to high school?  And what do her high school classmates think of her now?  Too many reality shows.  Eventually they'll run out of people to put on these shows.  There'll be a reality show with a cameraman roaming the streets in search of people who haven't been on reality shows.  And they won't find any.
