I sent my section a mass e-mail about the show I'm in this week.  I think it's kinda funny:  Apologies for sending a mass e-mail.  I'm a jury member in this weekend's production of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Trial by Jury" and the director is making me tell people about it so we have an audience.    The show is Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 8pm in Ames Courtroom.  The show takes place in a courtroom.  So that meant we didn't have to build a set, which was good.    It costs $5.  (Random fact: in 1875, when the musical was written, $5 in today's money was equivalent to 31 cents.)  Tickets are on sale in the Hark tomorrow from 10-2, or you can buy them at the door.  I don't get the feeling that you should worry at all about it being sold out if you wait to buy them at the door, but they didn't tell me to say that in my e-mail, so I make no promises.  Frequently Asked Questions  "What's the show about?"  Bitter over Edwin's refusal to marry, Angelina takes him to court to recover damages.  Edwin is forced to defend himself in front of a jury and a wacky judge.  Hijinks ensue.   "Is it all music, or if I come will I be forced to sit through boring dialogue too?"  No dialogue.  All songs.  Isn't that a relief.  "But 8pm on Thursday, Friday and/or Saturday nights are my favorite times to study."  That's not a question, it's a statement.  But anyway, the show is only 45 minutes long.  And besides, it contains a bunch of legal terms, like "breach of contract," and "court of the exchequer," and "be firm, be firm, my pecker."  (Those last two rhyme.)  So it's really sort of educational.  "But if it's only 45 minutes long, why is it worth my $5?"  Sorry, no more questions.  "Couldn't you have said all this in about three lines instead of writing this whole long e-mail?"  I said no more questions.  "Okay, okay, I get it.  Sorry."
