A parody song about law school grades.  To the tune of "Sloop John B," called "Law School B."  Note that I haven't received grades yet, so I have no real emotions to draw on yet.  We'll call this "potential scenario #1."  I'm stuck with the Law School B For overachievers like me We blame the curve, but still the grade is too low Studied all night Thought I was bright Well I feel so broke up I want to go home  You see all the B-range grades Still there's that sense of shame Thought you could rise above All of the rest, all of the rest I wanna go home, yeah yeah Well I feel so broke up I wanna go home  The gunner, man he got drunk Locked himself in his trunk The white coat men, they came to take him away All 'cause of that B He got in Property, yeah yeah Well he felt so broke up, and now he's gone home  The transcripts they all say B Some of the worst say C All of the students who hoped to make law review cry Let me go home, let me go home I wanna go home, let me go home Why don't you let me go home (Stuck with the law school B) Stuck with the law school B I feel so broke up I wanna go home Let me go home  The justice's son was disowned The one who got an A got stoned Classmates all threw rocks at him cracking his head Then he went home Helping the curve for next time, yeah yeah This is the worst grade a few ever saw  Let's all hold our B's up proud Lowest grade the registrar's allowed We pay tuition -- can't fail!  So we all get Bs Let me go home, let me go home I wanna go home, let me go home Why don't you let me go home
