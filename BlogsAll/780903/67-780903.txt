A Parody of the disco song "What Is Love" that I wrote for the a capella group which they probably (and justifiably!) won't use:  What is law Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more  Oh, baby don't sue me  Don't sue me no more   What is law  Yeah   Oh, you sued me, in District Court  But I want to have, the case removed to the state  Which law is right, which law is wrong  Gimme a rule   What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more  What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more   Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh  Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh   You win if we, apply state law But federal law, I will come out on top  We can't decide, the judge don't know  What can we do   What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more  What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more   Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh  Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh   What is law, oooh, oooh, oooh  What is law, oooh, oooh, oooh   What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more   Don't sue me  Don't sue me   I read State v. Tyson, Erie v. Tompkins But I still don't, have a clue All courts in all places, there must be more cases  But not International Shoe  What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more  What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more (oooh, oooh)   What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more  What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more (oooh, oooh)   What is law?
