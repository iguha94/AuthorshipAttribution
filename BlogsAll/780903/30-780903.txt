Tried to mail a small package -- really it's just a padded envelope with a CD and some papers -- today.  Sounds easy, right?  Well, the nearest post office is in Harvard Square, about a 10 minute walk --no big deal, but I didn't really want to walk 10 minutes.  So I went to the Harvard mail room.  Surely they'd be able to tell me how much my package weighed, right?  I wasn't even going to ask them to let me buy the stamps from them, or ask them to toss it in the mail for me -- although those both seem like reasonable things that might be possible in a mail room.  All I wanted to know was what the package weighed.  Me: Excuse me?  I have a little package I want to mail, but I'm not sure how much it weighs.  I was hoping you might have a scale and be able to tell me how much postage I need to put on it. Woman: Oh.  I don't do that.  Try Room 4.  They have a pretty good scale. Me: Thanks. (I walk to Room 4) Me: Excuse me?  I have a little package I want to mail, but I'm not sure how much it weighs.  The woman down the hall told me you might have a scale and be able to tell me how much postage I need to put on my package. Man: I don't do that. Me: What do you mean? Man: We don't do that. Me: Don't do what?  Can't you just tell me what this weighs? Man: I have a scale, but we really don't do that. Me: I see the scale.  It's right over there.  Can't you just weigh this for me and tell me how many ounces? Man: Aw, just give me the package and I'll see what I can do. (I hand him the package.  He takes 4 steps to the scale and weighs the package.) Man: It's about 3 ounces, basically. Me: More than 3 ounces, or less than 3? Man: I don't know.  It's less than a half a pound. Me: Yeah, I know. Man: So it's about 3 ounces. Me: Great. Thanks. (he hands me back the package) Man: Don't ask me how much postage that is though.  I don't know.  It's a bunch of stamps. Me: Yeah, I'll just look it up I guess.  Thanks. Man: Sure. [Sigh]
