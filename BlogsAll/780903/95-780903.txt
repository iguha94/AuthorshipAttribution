I don't think I've posted this before... apologies if I have... but I don't think I did...  "I Can Finally Get Hired" (to the tune of “Higher” by Creed)  When reading I'm dreaming ‘bout another world  A world where I get paid  At sunrise I want to be at interviews  And talk about the law and all about myself  'Cause there's a hunger, a longing for the good life  Fulfilling all the dreams I’ve had since was four   I’ll make partner  Then I’ll find me a life I will make partner Then I’ll buy me a wife    I can finally get hired So my law career can start  I can finally get hired Because I am really smart  It’s easy when firms are falling over To try and talk to second-years but I am not quite there Cause first year, they say that it’s a challenge But I am gonna be the first one, who’s hired for the year  First step towards the White House And first step towards my future monarchy  I’ll make partner  After my third heart attack I will make partner And buy my wife a new rack    I can finally get hired At a firm where rates are high  I can finally get hired Work like mad until I die  I’ll make partner, partner I will make partner I will partner some day  In suits I feel like I’m alive for the very first time With dictionaries, photocopies, Westlaw searches, lunches with the boss All that I’m learning in legal writing will soon pay off  I can finally get hired Doors are opening, let me through  I can finally get hired Legal research is what I’m meant to do I can finally get hired All my loans be reimbursed I can finally get hired Just after midnight, it’s December first…
