A Song Lyric About the Socratic Method of Teaching  It was early Monday morning I was sitting in my class The teacher has her seating chart ...and we're not allowed to pass  I sink down a little lower And pretend that I'm not there I look into my laptop screen  ...start my game of solitaire  And she's calling on my neighbor And he gets the answer wrong Where's my casebook, am I ready, must stay strong  Chorus -- (Don't call on me) I did not read the case (Don't call on me) I'm trying to hide the blank look on my face I've been staring into space... Don't call on me  She insults the guy with dandruff She dismisses Mr. Yale She says anyone who's not prepared Will fail.  She goes up and down the aisles Sees me win my pinball game Goes back to check her seating chart Please don't look at my name  And she's got all of this power And this look that's in her eyes She's just waiting for when your name's a surprise  Chorus -- (Don't call on me) I did not read the case (Don't call on me) I'm trying to hide the blank look on my face I've been staring into space... Don't call on me  Bridge -- And the guy who went to Stanford Again has peed his pants And the girl who's formed a study group Has breast implants But that's not really relevant  Chorus -- (Don't call on me) I did not read the case (Don't call on me) I'm trying to hide the blank look on my face I've been staring into space... (Don't call on me) You're gonna make me cry (Don't call on me) I'll kiss my pride goodbye I am here in law school why? Don't call on me Please Don't call on me
