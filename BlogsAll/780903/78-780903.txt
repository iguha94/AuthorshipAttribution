More wordplay.  I'm in the middle of studying civil procedure, so I thought I'd try a rhyming couplet for each of a bunch of Federal Rules.  These are mostly pretty dumb I guess.  Sorry.  Rule 8: Plead your facts plain and short Or your case will be thrown out of court  9(b): If it's fraud, be complete 'Cause it's not nice to call one a cheat  11: Make sure paper's signed Or you may well get yourself fined  12(b)(6): There isn't a claim Your facts have no law to their name  12(e): If the pleading is vague Like "that thing he sold gave me the Plague"  12(h): You might lose a defense Malpractice suit's quite an expense  (13) Is asserting my counterclaim good? If it's all one transaction you should  (14) If another guy's really the cheater Then bring him in with an impleader  (15) My pleading's wrong! Can I amend? If the trial judge is your best friend  (23) Tiny lawsuits don't bring satisfaction But together they make a class action   (24) "Let me in!" she screamed, causing a scene 'Til the judge let the girl intervene  (26) Divorce case, so gifts from her lover Are perfectly fair to discover  (28) Just subpoenas: I don't need permission To take anyone's deposition  (32) If you've died since I had you deposed Then I may present all you disclosed  (35) Are you insane enough to commit? An exam: the court has to permit  (55) You may not have committed assault But by staying home from court, you're in default  You may think that these couplets all suck But in my head, all these rules are now stuck
