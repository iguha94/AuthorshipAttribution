Merry Christmas!  Here in New York, the snow's coming down pretty hard.  Yet, even on Christmas, in the middle of a snowstorm, we were still able to get chinese food delivered.  What a world we live in!  In honor of the snow... it's yet another pair of song parodies... I promise more variation once I'm back at school and things are actually happening that can inspire me to have something to write about...  One about the law... "Just a 'B'" (to the tune of "Let It Snow")  Oh the thought of a "C" is frightful And an "A" would be delightful But I'll be okay to see Just a B, Just a B, Just a B.  The law isn't learned by osmosis The wave of a wand, "hocus-pocus" In the classroom I've got only me Just a B, Just a B, Just a B  When the test paper's there in my hand And I realize I don't know the law I suppose then I will understand That studying's what winter break's for!  Right now there are students reading And they'll be the ones succeeding As I write this song par-o-dy Just a B, Just a B, Just a B  And one not about the law... "Fill the Malls" (to the tune of "Deck the Halls")  Fill the malls with Christmas shoppers Fa la la la la, La la la la Eating donuts, eating Whoppers Fa la la la la, La la la la Spending money, all on credit Fa la la, La la la, La la la Self-control? Aw just forget it! Fa la la la la, La la la la  See the people fight for Barbies Fa la la la la, La la la la Eating fattening food from Arby's Fa la la la la, La la la la One of each, let's keep on churning Fa la la, La la la, La la la Back tomorrow for returning Fa la la la la, La la la la  Now we've got that Christmas feeling Fa la la la la, La la la la Boxes stacked up to the ceiling Fa la la la la, La la la la Low low prices! Down they're marking! Fa la la, La la la, La la la Twenty dollars just for parking Fa la la la la, La la la la!
