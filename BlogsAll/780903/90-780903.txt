"You Have Jurisdiction over Me"  (The guy sings)  In civil procedure, I sit next to you And stare at you from your head to your International Shoe You made my heart skip a beat when your Long Arm touched my casebook I stared at your picture for three hours in my facebook  And though you're from a different land I hope you'll give me your hand So I can serve you process I want to purposely avail Of what makes you that one female No matter what the law says  This is procedure, not contracts And we have minimum contacts So despite our diversity In your court is where I want to be You have jurisdiction over me  (The girl sings)  In civil procedure you sit next to me And yours is the only laptop I ever need to see Watching you play solitaire has shown me what real lust is If we're not together it won't be substantial justice  You are the one guy in this school Who'd make me break a fed'ral rule Don't 12-b-6 dismiss me You look at me and my heart skips The venue's here on my two lips You see, I'm asking you to kiss me  This is procedure, not contracts And we have minimum contacts So despite our diversity In your court is where I want to be You have jurisdiction over me  (They sing together)    We've satisfied International Shoe And my Erie choice of law is you And though the federal question's unclear It's worth more than seventy-five thousand dollars To have you here  This is procedure, not contracts And we have minimum contacts So despite our diversity In your court is where I want to be You have jurisdiction over me
