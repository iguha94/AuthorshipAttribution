(Celebrity Last Name #2) in the (State) (Adjective) Court, on appeal from Judge (Person you dislike)'s court in (Place you don't want to go).  On (Date), the Plaintiff alleges that he/she entered into a contract with the Defendant.  The plaintiff promised to (Deviant Activity #1) in exchange for the defendant promising to (Deviant Activity #2).  The question before the court is whether (Deviant Activity #2) served as sufficient consideration to create a binding contract.    In the case of (Celebrity Last Name #3) v. (Celebrity Last Name #4), the court ruled that the plaintiff's promise to (Deviant Activity #3) was in fact sufficient consideration to support a payment by the defendant of (Number) dollars and three (Plural Noun).  However, the judge insisted that because of unequal (Activity) skills, the contract was void on public policy grounds.  Conversely, in the case of (Celebrity Last Name #5) v. (Celebrity Last Name #6), the court ruled that the plaintiff's promise to (Deviant Activity #4) was made in bad faith, and could not support the defendant's promise to (Action, present tense) every day for the rest of his life.  In the case before us, we hold that the contract is (adjective), but unfortunately is in violation of the (Another adjective) Evidence rule and the Statute of (Another plural noun).  Our judgment is supported by the (Number) restatement on contracts, written by (a family member) while (Deviant Activity #5).  Case dismissed.  Time for Justices to (Deviant Activity #6).
