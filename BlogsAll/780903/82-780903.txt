A song about the Parol Evidence Rule.  (For the non-law students in the audience: the Parol Evidence Rule is simply a rule that says if you have a contract in writing, you're not allowed to claim there's stuff you talked about that wasn't included in the contract that should be enforced.  For example, you buy a car, the contract says nothing about a CD player, and you claim the seller said he'd install a new CD player.  You're out of luck.  And one more thing -- Parol is pronounced with a long o, like parole, or hole, or goal, or birth control.)  We met on a park bench in the summer A day that surely changed my life Because just seven hours later I asked you if you'd be my wife  You said you needed time to think it over And forty-five seconds passed like years You said you'd love to have a wedding And we could register at Sears   That's when I knew that we different From two separate income brackets You buy generic acetaminophen I have 3 ten thousand dollar tennis rackets So I asked you to sign A pre-nuptial agreement to say That when I divorce you You'll be back at the Sizzler buffet   I told you that I'd always support you But wrote down you don't get a cent Told you you'd never have to worry "You'll be poor" is what I meant  And since I am a contracts lawyer And you dropped out of school at eight You did not really read the contract And make me set the record straight   So nine months later it's our trial I found someone slightly thinner You want back the shirt you bought me I want you to starve for dinner And that's what you signed The contract says you have zero claim What I said doesn't count From a rule that has a name  It rhymes with birth control Which we didn't use, so you'll have a kid, and you'll both be on the dole But I don't care Saved by parol The parol evidence rule Keeping rich people rich That's what they teach us in law school  (Note: I haven't actually studied yet... so my understanding of the Parol Evidence Rule may be totally screwy.  Oh well.)
