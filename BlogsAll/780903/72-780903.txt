Inspired to write a song about the holidays.  It's not about law school.  Thankfully.  Finally.  It's a ballad.  :)  A little unfocused, but it's just a first draft.  Of something.  At least it's not about law school.  :)  As we put away the presents As we take apart the tree* Say goodbye to wrapping paper Say goodbye to family  As we finish all the cookies Cut the final piece of cake Close our eyes and picture snowfall On the ground when we awake  It's another year gone quickly As the time is flying by I can't freeze these memories But I can try  (chorus) I don't want to face uncertain future Not when now has turned out not so bad I don't want to find out that I'm living In the best days of the life I will have had.  As the snowman melts to water As the leftovers are gone As there's no more sharing stories Stay up talking until dawn  As the years pass bonds are broken People go their separate ways Suddenly it's been a lifetime Made of long-forgotten days  It's another set of moments That are passing through the air Once they've slipped through our fingers They're no longer there  (chorus) I don't want to face uncertain future Not when now has turned out not so bad I don't want to find out that I'm living In the best days of the life I will have had.  (bridge) I never used to realize when you grow up you're still who you are inside That there's no switch that turns you from a child to a man There's no beacon of direction, there's no light that shines the way Everyone's just out there doing what he can  (chorus) I don't want to face uncertain future Not when now has turned out not so bad I don't want to find out that I'm living In the best days of the life I will have had.  *Is "take apart" the right verb for what you do with a Christmas tree when you're done with it.  "Unscrewing the electric bulbs from the menorah" doesn't have the same song-feeling, so I'm an honorary Christian for the purposes of writing the song...
