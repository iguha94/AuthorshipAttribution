It's hard to study at home.  Much easier to surf the web, watch TV, and sleep.  Yet I must persist.  Or write another law-school-parodying song.  If the world went by the model penal code... And if you were one day walking 'cross the road... And a car came by and flattened you Yes he roadkill-in-Manhattaned you Then a prison sentence surely he'd be owed If the world went by the model penal code...  If it turned out he was merely negligent... And to hit you wasn't something that he meant... If he simply hadn't hit the brake It was just an innocent mistake Then while it would surely be a felony Negligent homicide is just a third degree  But if he was in fact a reckless reckless man Driving even though the law didn't say he can If he's blind and deaf and has no arms And he caused you homicidal harms And he thought he had a license; he did not Then it's probably manslaughter what he's got  If he did purposely and knowingly commit A gun that he done shot or wrist he slit Then it's murder, murder first degree He values life indifferently And the inside of the jail will be his life If he thought and deliberated -- then killed his wife  If the world went by the model penal code... If the world went by the model penal code... If the rules were set consistently 'Bout the different kinds of felony Then at least what you were doing could be knowed If the world went by the model penal code...
