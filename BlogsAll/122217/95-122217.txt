         Busy days... but I thought I'd drop off a quick note to say hi and wish all of you well.  I got back from Des Moines yesterday and said hello to my own place and my own bed. And my own roommate whom I haven't seen for a month. It's been the longest I've been away from him since we met and it's seemed unbearable at times. We spent most of the day hanging out, talking about boyfriends, collaborations, flings, love, apartments, one-night stands, life and pictures on the wall. I've missed my friends, no doubt about it.    Puck  sent a mix CD of cool tunes and it's been my soundtrack all evening.  I pulled out my videotapes of the First Gulf War... or shall we call it GW1? (You can also use "Operation Ass Whooping" or "Saddam-Smasher" or "Eat This" for the second reference.) For some strange reason, I video-ed about 50 hours of CNN and other coverage in 1991... beginning with the very moment of CNN's switch to Baghdad for the first words of Bernard Shaw... "Something's happening." Dave and I watched clips for about 15 minutes. The parallels are amazing... even though we were looking at a thinner Wolf Blitzer from 12 years ago. It's hard not to think "here we go again." You all know my preference for diplomacy... but with war about to happen, let's hope for all involved that it's brief and with as little loss of life as possible.  I installed   Microsoft Office 11 Beta 2  this afternoon and now I'm typing away in the new colorful, cleartype environment of the new Office. The   current Mac version  looks exactly   10.3 times hotter ... but I'm loving the many little improvements over Office XP. And since nearly all of my life occurs within the confines of Outlook and Word, the new look is a change of pace. The Evil Empire has also released the beta of its new   One Note  program.
