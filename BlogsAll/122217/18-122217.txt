         This might be a little heavy for a Monday, but a reader sent this to me over the weekend and I think it shows the sadness of someone faced with a dark secret that he couldn't reveal to others. This poem written by the reader's uncle. It was found in his college dorm room after he committed suicide at the age of 18 in 1925.    I wandered o'er the sloping hills Wondering where to find life's thrills I thought of the things drear and sad That had made life for me what it had.    I remembered the taint of the city's glare The flash of lights, the trumpet's blare The noisy streets, the continual din The paths of men that lead to sin.    I considered the rural districts' charm But to me t'was but the drudge of the farm Where man must work his hands to the bone To procure a living for himself alone.    In country and city, I can find no rest And life dogs my footsteps like a pest. Ah--to my befuddled brain a plan--a plan! Tomorrow night--the broken span.    It's a sad poem and I guess for me, it reminds me of the pain that so many people experience in coming to terms with being gay. The writer penned this poem more than 75 years ago. But unfortunately, many people dealing with this issue feel the same sense of hopelessness now.
