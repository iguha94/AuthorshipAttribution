         So my friend Chris gave me a VHS with the first episodes of the new HBO series   "Six Feet Under."  I watched the first episode yesterday afternoon and was really impressed with it. When Dave got home last night we popped the tape in and watched the episode.  The second episode followed... then the third, fourth... and we watched the fifth episode after that. The whole evening turned into a "Six Feet Under" festival... and we can't wait to see the next episode.  I like a lot of things about the new series. First of all, it's not like the other crap on TV. There are no unsuspecting people being subjected to stunts pulled by cheap "Candid Camera" knockoffs. People aren't voting others off an island. There's no short bitch in black taunting some poor saps with bad puns. Let me just say  Thank God for HBO!   Second,   Alan Ball  has created somewhat odd, but quite believeable, characters. We're talking about one dysfunctional family. But I think all of us can see elements of our parents, siblings and even ourselves in these characters.  Third, he's created two of the most credible gay characters I've seen on television so far. This is part of a general broadening of the depiction of gay life on TV. But I especially like the direction Ball is going with   David  and   Keith . They are solid, grounded gay men... and the issues that the two are grappling with are new for gay characters on TV-- unless I've missed something.  Fourth, it's a nice use of the medium. There are some beautiful shots, and the show has a top notch   soundtrack . If you've not seen "Six Feet Under" yet, I'd recommend you give it a shot. I know it's tough! There's "  The Sopranos ," "  Queer As Folk ," "  Oz ," "  Sex and the City "-- there's almost so much good television right now that we have to cut back on the crap TV just to see it all!
