         Dave is away for a few hours... 5 year old Gabe is seeing Grandma and Grandpa for the evening... the house is clean at last! It's a Saturday night and I have nothing to do and I'm so glad to be saying that.  It's been a long time since I wrote here... but suffice it to say it's been an eventful period. Gabe is with us for the summer and that means much of the world revolves around him. I'm not complaining. I love that little boy with all my heart. He's got enough energy to electrify a major city, but he has a beautiful heart. So he and I have great times together.   I'm trying very hard to stake out a part of my life that's my own. Part of this is because of work pressures... but I've also been concerned lately that I'm neglecting to deal with things that come up in my life. I've ignored those things by using the convenient excuse that I'm too busy to handle them now. Well, none of these issues are life and death, so to speak.  But no matter the issue... sooner or later it's better to face it, and get it out of the way. So I need to create a little bit of space so I can do that this summer. That will be my goal.  By the way... Gabe is still firmly committed to the idea of Spiderman.
