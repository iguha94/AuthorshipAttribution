My National Post today says that "Harper Widens Seat Lead." I'm not too sure about this.   I've not seen his seat.   But more seriously, there's the latest Ipsos-Reid poll for CTV and the Globe and Mail showing the Liberals ahead by six points.   Soblo  says this puts the Liberals and new-fangled Tories essentially back where they started a few weeks ago.  So what's with the seats? The National Post and Montreal Gazette, sister papers, say 126 Conservative seats, 95 Liberals, 60 for the Bloc and 27 NDP. The Globe and Mail extrapolates based on its new poll: 110 seats each for L and C.  The papers report most of the country has decided, except for Ontarians, which is interesting; maybe they're trying to decide just how angry they are at the Liberals, and just how concerned they might be about a Harper government.  Last month, I said I wasn't going to concentrate too much on polls. But frankly, in a race this close and this uncertain, the polls can provide good snapshots of how people are agonizing over choices. If predictions come true, there will be a low turnout, and that only increases uncertainty. And there are 5 more days of politicking before Monday's elections. That's plenty of time for another stupid Conservative move - child porn, for instance - or another Liberal gaffe.  We will see. I don't want Harper, or his hardened helmet of hair, running the show. In the past few days, I've felt cautious optimism.
