         I'll always love this city. It's just too cool. Maybe not to live in... I don't know. But I've always found that for sheer relaxation value, it's hard to beat.  I've been doing one of about 4 things over the past few days... reading, working out, sleeping, seeing my friend Chris and his friends. My triceps ache... my   abs  are tighter... all good signs of how much better my workouts are when i can concentrate on them more without distractions like work. Ah, but is work really a distraction?  I've written a lot about the relationship so I'm going to leave that alone for a while. I've been thinking a lot lately about concepts like  trust  and  understanding  and  self-confidence . My own situation has prompted those thoughts... but also the situations of a few friends of mine. I'll probably write some about these things. A friend of mine wrote some of his thoughts about   monogamy  and I'm planning to add a few of my own, too.  This could be a shameless plug:  Dan Woog's latest book,   Jocks 2 , is out. It features the stories of gay athletes and the struggles that they have faced in coming out and living as members of the LGBT community. I can't say it's great because I haven't received my copy yet. But Dan Woog's work is typically quite good. And I think we can expect the same from this new book.  In the interests of full disclosure, I should mention that Woog has written a chapter about   my boyfriend  and how he was forced to quit his job as a school official and basketball coach because he came out. The   guy on the cover  is hot. He is not my boyfriend... but I think my guy is cuter and, yes... hotter.
