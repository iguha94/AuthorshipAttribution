         ... how this morning is almost a perfect carbon copy of the morning we woke up to a year ago? A clear, blue sky... a beautiful sunny morning. Such is the case in New York and Washington... and such is also the case in Ann Arbor, MI. I stand on the roof of one of the buildings on the Michigan campus and I can see over the horizon to one year ago.   Dave and I had had a long discussion the night before about the bombing of the World Trade Center. We'd used Google to look up articles on the rebuilding after the bombing. We had discussed how the bombing was more damaging to the structure of the towers than first realized. We speculated about what might have happened if they had collapsed.  The next morning I got up and went for an early workout. I parked the car at 8:55am and walked home. I got home at 9:10am... and that's how my unforgettable day began.  Looking outside this morning, I was tempted to think it was September 11, 2001 all over again. How many millions of Americans have thought how many millions of times about getting the chance to relive that day. Maybe it's just to get the chance to be somewhere else... or to get the chance to relocate friends and relatives who were victims-- to move them out of the line of fire. How many times have you thought over the past year...  if only I could undo what's happened ?  Or course, we can't. We have to look back, mourn and move on. As   trcnyc  says   today ...   Honor the past... Embrace the future  .
