         We had a nice weekend... spending part of it out of town, seeing friends, talking, committing the occasional illegal act... all in all a productive time for us as a couple. That's something that has come slowly to us. We were best friends almost instantly when we met a year ago. We felt the electricity that happens when two people are on the same wavelength and can collaborate to make something significant happen. But we were both too stubborn to give up the measure of independence that two people have to give up to be a couple-- one unit.  Well, nothing is ever perfect and we're far from it. But we've learned this lesson and we're working hard to create something different this time around. It's cool to look at the handsome guy who is my boyfriend and feel such a strong connection to him.  We went to see The Ring on Friday afternoon. I know people are arguing over whether it's any good or not. We liked it, despite plot weakness. Frankly, both of us were ready for a scary movie. It's been years since I was truly frightened at the movies. This wasn't the fright of all time... but it was a good scare and that was worth the price of the (reduced) admission. At this point, I'm looking forward to The Two Towers-- the next in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. And let's not forget Star Trek: Nemesis-- because I can't resist watching everything and nearly everyone get destroyed. Ah, but is it ever truly over....
