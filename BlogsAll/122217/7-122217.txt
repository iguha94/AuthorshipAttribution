         Good day!  It's a busy one, but I thought I'd pass along this bit of humor forwarded me from my friend Rick:   The Washington Post  recently published a contest for readers in which they were asked to supply alternative meanings for various words. The following were some of the winning entries:   Abdicate  (v.), to give up all hope of ever having a flat stomach.   Carcinoma  (n.), a valley in California, notable for its heavy smog.   Esplanade  (v.), to attempt an explanation while drunk.   Willy-nilly  (adj.), impotent.   Flabbergasted  (adj.), appalled over how much weight you have gained.   Negligent  (adj.), describes a condition in which you absentmindedly answer the door in your nightie.   Coffee  (n.), a person who is coughed upon.   Testicle  (n.), a humorous question on an exam.   Rectitude  (n.), the formal, dignified demeanor assumed by a proctologist immediately before he examines you.   Circumvent  (n.), the opening in the front of boxer shorts.  The Washington Post's Style Invitational also asked readers to take any word from the dictionary, alter it by adding, subtracting or changing one letter, and supply a new definition:   Sarchasm:  The gulf between the author of sarcastic wit and the reader who doesn't get it.   Reintarnation:  Coming back to life as a hillbilly.   Inoculatte:  To take coffee intravenously.   Dopeler effect:  The tendency of stupid ideas to seem smarter when they come at you rapidly.   Intaxication:  Euphoria at getting a refund from the IRS, which lasts until you realize it was your money to start with.
