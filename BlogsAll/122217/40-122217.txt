         Writing you all from Chicago... I thought I should say something since it's been several days since I wrote anything here.  I had a great weekend seeing friends in Iowa... and even one of my brothers.  D  and I went back for the weekend so I could do some TV work. The Big  D  is moving home tomorrow, which makes me very happy. It's been an interesting journey for both of us over the last 7 weeks. But all's well that ends well. Of course, is it really over? Well, that's the thing about love and life... it never is. D and I have been spending a lot of time talking with each other about worked the last time around... and of course, what didn't.  More things worked than didn't. But the things that didn't were enough to sink the relationship. So now as we start over again, we need to try as much as we can to avoid the mistakes we made before.  You know what? It takes a lot of thinking to do that. I think any of us can rattle off a list of things that didn't work about a relationship. But what about the next step? Can we take that list... turn it around... and develop a game plan to implement in the next relationship?  This is literally what  D  and I are doing.  D  is a sports guy and so we're borrowing that analogy to develop strategies... to preserve the relationship and other strategies to make sure that we avoid the pitfalls we fell into before... as best we can.  It's strategy... planning.. flying by the seat of your pants... screwing up... turning around mid play and running the other way. It's about  love .
