         I've had Windows XP running for a few days now and other than the   Passport/Windows Messenger problems , all seems to be well. I'll post more on the OS in a few days.   Mossberg: You Go!!   The   Wall Street Journal's  Walter Mossberg, who played a big role in bringing the   Smart Tags issue  to the fore a few weeks back-- and helping to force MSFT to back down on the feature-- is back with a new concern about Microsoft.    He says  people who own more than one PC who want to upgrade to Windows XP are going to face a rude awakening. In his latest column, he describes MSFT's plan to force users to purchase one copy of Windows XP for each computer they own. Now, if you've ever bothered to read the really REALLY fine print in the software license-- and if you have thick glasses and buck teeth, maybe you have-- you've known that Microsoft has always preferred that we buy one copy for each use.  But they never enforced it-- until now. Each copy requires "Product Activation" and you can't activate the same copy of Windows XP from more than one computer. Office XP is somewhat kinder in that you can activate it from up to 2 PC's.  To quote liberally from Mossberg:  What if your PC malfunctions, and you have to reinstall Windows XP? Well, you'll have to explain the situation to Microsoft, and beg the company to allow you to activate it again. What's more, Windows will keep monitoring your setup to check that it's still running on the same machine. If you make major hardware changes, the system could disable Windows and force you to check in with Microsoft in the mistaken belief the program has been transferred to another computer.  As Mossberg writes: I'm not making this up!!  Someone emailed me yesterday about this: "I respectfully offer but one word of counsel:   Linux ."  I'm glad somebody said it!
