         I wish they would go on and on and on...  This has probably been one of the better weekends in some time. And I haven't done a damn thing. Tomorrow, I'll be getting back into the work week. I have plenty of studying to do for the week ahead. And I have a big project that involves reading just about everything I can get my hands on about Madeline Albright. It's for something I'm doing with her later this month.  But you know what? That's tomorrow. Tonight I'm sitting at Sweetwater's Cafe and doing some people-watching.  So, you know how they always talk about how if a guy pulls out his cell phone, every other guy at the table will do the same? Everyone talks about how it's all about comparing penises or something. Well... women do it, too. And you can see it if you watch for it. There are 3 women sitting at a table in front of me right now. One of them is named Buffy. She looks like a Buffy.  Buffy takes out her phone and loudly makes a call. Cari and Summer (she looks like she'd be named for a season-- or maybe a flower) both pull out their phones and look at them. Cari polishes her phone with her sleeve like it's a piece of fine crystal. Or some such heirloom. Summer clicks through her address book... trying to think of someone she can call.  That's exactly what I would do. Except that when someone near me pulls out their phone and I feel that impulse (it's totally genetic) I try to resist it. I feel like I'm overcoming some base impulse when I do this. I'm probably just fooling myself because, seconds later, I'll reach for my Palm.  Actually, Summer talks loudly enough that the person she's calling can probably hear her without the phone. It's puzzling because she sneezes very quietly. Hmmmm.... time to move on.
