         This has been... one of the most intense weeks of the past year for me. There was a ton of work to do. I had a bad case of Spring fever. And I couldn't get more than just the bare-bones workout in all through the week.  But Saturday has been a super calm day and I'm looking forward to an evening of nothing but reading, web surfing and general time wasting at the coffee shop.  The boyfriend went camping this week along the shores of Lake Superior. He was only gone for a couple days, but he came back so happy and relaxed that I wish I could have gone with him.  Plus, he was lucky enough to be able to see the Northern Lights on Wednesday night. It's a pretty strong storm if you can see it in mid-Michigan.  The   Naked Mile  took place this week. Or at least I think it did. The University of Michigan has been in maximum discouragement mode about this event for the past 3 years or so. I remember at the time people involved with the program thought they'd be able to eliminate the run within 3 years. And as far as I can tell, they've been hugely effective. It still takes place but it's a   shadow of its former self . And media coverage is almost nil.  I saw it in 1999, and it was interesting from the point of view of social taboos. I stood up on the roof of a building and watched people finishing the race 5 stories below.  There's something almost surreal about seeing people wandering in and out of the Michigan Union... completely naked. There's certainly nothing titillating about it.
