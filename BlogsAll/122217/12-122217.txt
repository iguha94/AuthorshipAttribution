         I'm going to be  34 years old  tomorrow. And in case you can't tell I'm happy about it! :)  You see, here's the thing. The excitement of Gay Life doesn't end at 30. It ends when I stop breathing. And until then, I'm on top of the world. Don't get me wrong... I feel very fortunate to have had success... and I don't believe in crowing about it. But tomorrow, as I celebrate turning 34... I'm going to. My career is as far along as it's ever been. My body looks better than it ever has. I've come through more life-changing and mind-expanding experiences this year than any other year up till now. I have some amazing friends. And I'm beginning to own up to my responsibility to speak out and make a difference.  I have stumbled much. I've made many mistakes. I've done too many stupid things to number. Life is not about forgetting these mistakes... but learning from them, and being mindful of them even as I move on.  So tomorrow I'll celebrate. I'll go out with friends and remember a few of the things that have happened this past year. I'll eat a bunch of ice cream, in spite of my better judgment. For the first time, I'll post shirtless pictures of myself on my website... with pics from 4 years ago.  Life is wondrous... how exciting to get to wake up and experience yet another day of it!
