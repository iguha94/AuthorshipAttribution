         It's quiet here at dot-org this weekend... but I'm working on a larger piece that I plan to post here on Monday. There should be a few other ramblings here later tonight and Sunday, too.  Mainly today is catch-up for me. The house is empty, which means it will get a massive cleaning tonight and tomorrow. I have about 6 loads of laundry to do... and plenty of time in which to get it done! The downside is I'm car-less... it's with D at his parents. So no gym workouts this weekend, which sucks. I'll do several hundred pushups and situps here today and tomorrow... but there's nothing like pushing the plates to stimulate the endorphins.   D and I were in Grand Rapids last night for a work-related event. We stayed overnight at the Hilton and this morning I went downstairs... took one look at the broom closet they call the "fitness center" and trudged back up to bed. Hotel fitness centers suck... almost without exception. I know this to be a fact, but I still always expect to be pleasantly surprised. My work got me a couple passes to a real gym... but alas, no time. When it snows in Grand Rapids, you either hunker down for the lake effect deluge or high-tail it out of there, and we chose to do the latter.  I took Monday off-- the University of Michigan, where I work, doesn't have a holiday for MLK day.
