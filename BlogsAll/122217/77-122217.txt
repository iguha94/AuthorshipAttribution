         ... usually don't get me down. (Neither do rainy days.) Especially after a quiet weekend with lots of sleep and good times with friends.  Dave and I had a little movie marathon Friday night. We watched two movies Dave has seen... but that I had missed when they came out:  American History X  and  Malcolm X . I think both movies are masterworks-- great performances by Denzel Washington and Ed Norton, in particular. And American History X makes such a strong, yet subtle, argument about hate; it's powerful without being preachy. If you haven't seen it... you must.  Here's a little piece of advice: avoid having 7 cups of coffee in a 2-1/2 hour period. It does things to you. I got up Sunday morning around 3:30am and couldn't sleep. I chatted for a while with my friend  B  and he suggested going out for coffee at   the Fleetwood . We met at 4:30am and by 7am, I had consumed 7 cups of coffee and two glasses of water.  That's the thing about diner coffee. It's so damn good. It's bottom of the line Sysco coffee... but I could drink cup after cup-- as long as I was sitting in a diner chatting it up with a friend. So anyway, back to my story. I went home at 7am on a high that approached inebriation. I woke Dave up by jumping on him to tell him I was home... and then I lay down. And lay there until 8:55am before I got up to hit the gym. The shoulder workout wasn't bad but there was no disputing that my high was continuing. Needless to say, I ordered grapefruit juice at   brunch  and skipped the java.  And while I'm thinking of it, a short tribute to Sunday Brunch. For the most part, I'm Mr. Healthy. But on the weekend, one must make allowances. Sunday is my day to have the big breakfast... three egg omelet, hash browns... or huevos rancheros and rice and beans. Even now, it makes me hungry. hmmm... only 6 days to go. Actually, with my weight currently stalled at 144 lbs... maybe I should have one of those breakfasts more often!
