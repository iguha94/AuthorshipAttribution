         It's been a while since I last wrote anything. I was in DC for a few days... seeing friends and taking it easy.   I read most of "  The Radical Center ." It's a great "new politics and ideas of the 21st century" kind of book. I've really enjoyed it and the ideas it contains-- particularly the section on Social Security.  I've also been making additional progress in the   John Adams  bio by David McCullough. Now that it's won the Pulitzer Prize, I feel like I should get serious and finish it. I'm less than half way through it at this point. But it's great reading.  Sometimes, books go down easier than at other times. Know what I mean? There are some days or periods where even seeing a particular book reminds me how much I don't want to pick it up. But then this past week, I opened the John Adams after letting it sit for several months. I spent about 3 hours in it and I would have read much longer had we not run out of time.  I got quite a sunburn sitting outside   Cosi on Connecticut Ave in Dupont Circle  on Thursday. It was a gorgeous day and I spent about 4 hours working my way through "The Radical Center." I got the most ridiculous farmer's tan ever. It's fading pretty quickly now. But it's also peeling of course-- on my forehead and stuff. So that's the price I pay.
