         So now I'm  35!  Last year, when I turned 34, I rhapsodized about it. And as I   read that post again , I see no reason to 1) say anything more this year, or 2) to go on about it any longer.

So Thursday we spent 30 minutes on the phone in 3 sessions... discussing Chicago, work back here... everything else. Friday, we managed to keep it down to 5 minutes. Honestly, there have been times where I kept a list in my Palm of things to tell him. It's really quite pathetic. But at the same time, it's so cool to have someone that you can be that way with. Plus, we both know that this will be a momentous year for us, so we're making the most of it.   It's Webalicious...

The Economist  has a   fun piece  related to that idiotic   class action lawsuit filed against several fast food companies .
