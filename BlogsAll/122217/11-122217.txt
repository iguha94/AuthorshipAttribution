         A dinner my roommate and I had with some other gay friends last night reminded me of the rich history of gay life in America. In particular, of the Mattachine Society and the important role it played in gay life-- before 1970.   It was a very secretive society. But this was a time where most gay men were guarded about their sexual orientation-- even with other gay men. The fact that you wore a yellow handkerchief in your breast pocket might be the only indicator to another that you were "a friend of Dorothy." The Matachine Society itself was set up in such a way that members of one cell group in a city might not know anyone else who was a member of another cell in the same city. It was kind of like the Freemasons.  It was a very closed society for gay men at a time when society was very closed to gay men, if you get my drift. A new, more activist, gay consciousness grew in the years after Stonewall and the Mattachine Society fell behind the times. But it still holds an important place in gay history.  Here are some places where you can dig around for more information about the Matachine Society, or gay history in general.
