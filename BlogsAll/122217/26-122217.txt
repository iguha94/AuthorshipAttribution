         Hey everyone! Thanks for all the notes and e-cards wishing me well. The fever and stuff has held on for a long time-- longer than I'm used to-- but I think it's finally licked. As of this morning, all I have is a sore throat... and not a bad one at that. So that's one problem taken care of.   Here's the other problem...  my Internet connection.  I'll keep this story short and relatively rant-free. SBC Ameritech sent a guy over Thursday to fix my phone line. He fixed it, but in doing so, broke my 1.5 Mbps DSL connection. He was only trained in POTS so he had no idea how to fix it. So I'm without my normal DSL connection till sometime next week.  In the meantime, I'm borrowing from my neighbor's wireless connection. It gets me high speed access out-- which I need for work. But the connectivity is unstable because I'm at the edge of his service area.   Why am I telling you all this? Some of you IM me on AIM. Others IM on Windows Messenger. I'm getting knocked out of both services as signal strength varies. Each one then logs me back on when it can. AIM returns with the proper "away" message. Windows Messenger hasn't always been doing this. So if you IM me on Messenger because it looks like I'm there... chances are good I'm not.  Email is the best way to reach me over the next few days.   Thanks!
