I've reached what I'll call "Mansbridge Overload" on the Canadian federal elections. I'm still consuming about hour a day of Canadian campaign news, above and beyond my regular diet of Canadian bacon - The World at Six, Cross Country Checkup, election TV specials on CBC, the Globe and Mail, National Post... and tonight, the English Leadership Debate. But, I've never been a big fan of Peter Mansbridge on The National. I've taken to TiVoing the show and skipping through his parts.  I thought I would hate the whole Election Bus thing that CBC and the other networks are using to promote themselves. And I do. It's a big fat gimmick, except that the dude on the CBC bus is kind of cool. Mark Kelley, and Tod Maffin on Radio, have produced some really nice, quirky pieces exploring the Canadian hinterland and assessing the views of the electorate. They remind me of the pieces the American network correspondents do every four years when they discover that people actually live, however strangely, in flyover country. Except, American reports usually depict midwesterners as kindly rubes. A much larger proportion of the Canadian population lives in urban areas. But still, I haven't seen Canadian TV trying to do much more than show the quaintness of rural life.  By the way... you can read the official Bus weblog   here .  While I'm picking favorites, I'll also mention "Spinoff." It's a regular series of off-beat election reports. Most of it is excellent, some of it is quite funny. I don't think there are web archives of the program (CBC's Official Web Strategy places less emphasis on web-streaming than the BBC, for instance) but you can listen live online on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 11:45am ET on any of the CBC Radio One ET streams. Any online CBC station elsewhere in the country also runs it at 11:45am local time. Don't talk to me about Newfoundland Time.
