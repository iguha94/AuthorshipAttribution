         I got a new car today. I've been talking about it for longer then a year, but today I finally drove off the lot with a new Ford Escape. It's black and cool and stuff-- my first SUV... and the first time I'll be driving something where I'm not about 6 inches off the ground. After more than 7 years in the ground-hugging Acura Integra, I'm ready to see where I'm going in the forest of SUV's on the highway. Dave is training me to call it a "truck" and not a "car." I'm not getting this right very often, but I'm working on it.  Dave and I speak at a church tomorrow about the place of faith in the life of a gay man. It should be a good discussion. So many gays, lesbians and bisexuals who have a spiritual life feel forced to give it up because of the anti-gay attitudes of many in organized religions. I think we're lesser for it-- at least those of us who seek that kind of a life. So it will be a good chance to talk to straight people about the importance of reaching out to the LGBT community and to those who are among them. There are likely to be some people who are uncomfortable with gays and lesbians there... but I think most of the audience will be sympathetic to at least the general idea that LGBT individuals have something to contribute to the church.
