         ok... here's the question of the day: which takes less time... paying with exact change or accepting change as a part of your cash back?  I realize that even asking this question says something about me. And I admit it. I'm a very impatient person-- a total Type A when it comes to stuff like that.   I'm the type of person who never approaches a locked door without the key already out of the pocket and ready for the lock.   I've developed a complicated system of actions to speed my way through airport check-in and security. And my workday is one long string of maneuvers to get things done faster.  So there I am in line at Einstein's Bagels. I'm about to purchase a scone. In front of me-- one guy. The cash register rings up $4.18. The guy hands over a fiver. And just as the helper is about to grab his change, the guy says, "Wait a minute! I have change."  What follows next is almost too painful for words.  I could recount, in detail, the scrounging through pockets... the tedious counting of coins... how the guy comes up a penny short and has to settle for change for his five. But you'd probably be crying, screaming, begging me to stop.  In the meantime, the line has grown long, time has passed, Italy probably has a new Prime Minister, and everyone is focused on the guy in front, who scratches his head and smiles weakly, "Gosh, I thought I had enough."  Uh-huh.  Now there's another side to this: most of us think loose change is an annoyance. we'd jump at the chance to avoid getting more change. And if we could give up some of our coin stock, it would make our day. I estimate that I have close to a billion dollars in coins in cups at home.  So maybe I should stop complaining and develop another complicated system for having loose change at-hand. Then I could pay with exact change and reduce the roomful of pennies, nickels and dimes I have at home.  Nah...
