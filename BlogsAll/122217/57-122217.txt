         My friend Rick writes again from his whirlwind tour of Asia.      Australasia: Sheep on the Rocks     Itâ€™s hard to know what to make of New Zealand and Australia after a cursory visit over just a few days, but the overall impression is one of newness and refreshing simplicity.  It brings to mind that Steve Martin line from LA Stories: â€œWhy, some of these buildings are twenty years old!â€       Sydney even bears a strong geographical resemblance to Los Angeles.  Itâ€™s a flat basin teeming with people, facing the harbor and backed against rugged mountains.  Auckland is another city swept with bracing ocean breezes and unbreakably bound to the sea.  Both countries have expanses of territory more populated by sheep than people, and ocean waves crashing all around their pristine coastlines.     The impression of newness, though, is apocryphal.  The Maori and other South Pacific islanders had been happily settled in New Zealand for half a millennium before the Europeans found them and wrecked their lives in the late 1700s.  The aborigines of Australia can trace the longest continual cultural history in the world, back to the last Ice Age.  These are not new kids on the block.     See if you recognize this thumbnail national history.  A gold rush not long after 1849 that brought a torrent of miners and farmers alike, feeding the furnaces of the Industrial Revolution and pushing the natives off their tribal lands in the process.  This nation of immigrants carried the momentum of their single-minded productivity right through the postwar economic boom.     That nation is Australia.  The first load of 750 convicts came ashore here just a dozen years after the Declaration of Independence was signed by another bunch of outlaws in Philadelphia.     So how to account for the freshly-scrubbed personality of a place where few things are allowed to be more weighty than cricket, rugby and sailing?  I ascribe it to the gift of isolation.     For most of its history, Australasia was at best a very long boat ride from anywhere, and at worst a place you could only hope to read about.  Not thirty years ago, they paid Americans to move here.  Today you have to be young, skilled, or richâ€”and preferably all threeâ€”to be anything more than a tourist or student in Australia and New Zealand.    The splendid isolation that preserved and protected this corner of the world has finally fallen away, a victim of all the modern conveniences that have shrunk the planet in so many ways.  While it was there, like a bell jar over the South Pacific, a civilized society incubated at a proper pace.  It had the luxury of not having to be a military or economic superpower.  It could concentrate on its own well being.     Today it is prosperous, high-tech, often culturally edgy, and a fully engaged player on the world stage.   Nothing brought that last point home more forcefully than the recent bombings in Bali that killed so many Australians.  There are tinderbox domestic issues of trade, immigration, the environment, and the treatment of native people.  Politics here are lively, and personal.     That fresh feeling remains.  The question is whether the region has evolved enough in its years of relative isolation to withstand the intrusions of todayâ€™s wicked world, and preserve its charm and innocenceâ€”not to be mistaken for naivetÃ©â€”in a global community that usually places military might ahead of the Americaâ€™s Cup.     If so, perhaps we can learn a lot from it.    -- Rick
