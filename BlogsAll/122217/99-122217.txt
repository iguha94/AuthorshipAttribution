         I did that   shoulder workout  that   Jockohomo  recommended and I included in the journal earlier this week. And it  kicked my ass . I'm using italics because my arms are too tired to hit the bold key.  :)  The thing about working out is that what matters more than quantity is the quality of the workout you do. So there I was, doing just 4 exercises... a total of 14 sets... for a bodypart that I usually devoted 9 different exercises to. Now, I like how my shoulders are developing. But from the very first set today, I saw the veins in my shoulders popping out-- no doubt in surprise at the new movements I'd decided to spring on them. Under my skin, the muscles rippled and responded. I was done in about 30 minutes-- actually less. I was about to do some more just because it seemed so strange to be finished so soon. And then I lifted my arms up and at that point, I knew that I'd be feeling this workout full-on in about a day and a half.  Check out that shoulder workout, gym boys. If you've reached a plateau on shoulders... or simply want to shake up your shoulder routine, this could do the trick. Or integrate these exercises into your current routine.  Now, to find a biceps/triceps workout that kicks ass, too.  I finished reading   "In Search of Lost Time"  today... and so ends a 6 year quest. There were plenty of times over the last 6 years when I wondered if I would put the book down and never pick it up again. And, in fact, there were many months when I didn't read it. At one point, I left it alone for a year. It's too early to talk about what I feel after finishing it. After all, we're talking about 3700 pages. But like most novels, the author's words are a mirror in which we see ourselves in a new light.  What's next? I'll read   "The Human Web"  and   "How Proust Can Change Your Life"  this weekend... and then decide where to go from there.
