         My friend Rick writes again from his whirlwind tour of the Pacific Rim.     Ava Gardner once infuriated the residents of Melbourne, Australia  by pronouncing it the perfect place to make a movie about the end of the world.  And so she did.    I was an impressionable Midwestern 12-year-old when â€œOn the Beachâ€ hit movie theaters in 1959.  I never forgot the stark scenes of newspapers blowing down the empty canyons of dead but undamaged American cities, nor the haunting strains of â€œWaltzing Matildaâ€ that became the filmâ€™s mournful theme.  It may have been schmaltz, but it played well in Iowa in the twilight of the Eisenhower administration, still three years before the Cuban missile crisis.    More than forty years later I find myself sitting on a sunny spring morning in Melbourne, where Gregory Peck commanded the last American submarine after the fictional superpower nuclear exchange draped the globe in a deadly radioactive blanket.  Birds are singing a lusty song, and soft warm breezes stir in the trees.  On such a morning, Armageddon seems nowhere in sight.     The most disturbing thing about the unseen war in that movie was the fact that we lostâ€”everybody did.  The survivors in Australia just died a little later than the rest of the earthâ€™s population.  It was a hopeless, unstoppable tragedy.  There was no happy ending.    We were jumpy in those days.  There were fallout shelters marked with Civil Defense signs and stocked with crackers and water, and some people had fortified cellars at home.  At school, we learned to duck under our desks when The Big One came.  Itâ€™s more than a little silly to think we would survive the thermonuclear firestorm by huddling under desks and eating stale crackers, but it seemed sensible at the time.  Without that kind of initiative, the Cold War rendered us neurotic victims of uncertainty and fear.    Since the Gulf War a dozen years agoâ€”and long after our inglorious exit from the quagmire of Vietnamâ€”America has regained an unbecoming sense of national glee at its global invincibility.  Our confidence was rattled temporarily when flaming jetliners were flung as if by giant catapults to lay siege to New York and Washington.  Now weâ€™re back on top, double-daring Saddam Hussein to say the careless word that makes us scorch his desert into molten glass.  He and his country are unrelated to the attacks on our cities and citizens, but donâ€™t bother us with the details.  We are on a rapturous mission.     No playground bully ever felt a finer sense of imminent, stupefying triumph.    It has been a long time since the ugly American was so near-universally disliked, and often reviled.  We were one of the few tough guys on the playground in the sixties when they chanted, â€œYanqui go home,â€ and in the seventies when we got out of Southeast Asia and beat a hasty retreat from Iran.  Now weâ€™re a gang of one.    Competition is generally welcomed in the world of business.  We may come to miss it in the business of world domination.    Membership in the Gang of One makes us the only remaining nation with the power to make peace.  All the others can only make warâ€”with missiles, bombs, or rocks; with poison gas and superflu; with treachery and surprise when their munitions fail them.  Peace was once an ideal.  Against some of these new weapons and tactics, it is the only defense.     The role of single superpower is an unenviable one.  We have become the evil Goliath, the nation you love to hate, with countless Davids who see themselves as virtuous in their singleminded struggle to sling a fatal stone our way.  Itâ€™s enough to make you think about the bad old days of duck-and-cover drills.     Wake up and smell the popcorn.     The characters in the movie tried to carry on in the face of the inexorable advance of the lethal cloud.  Much like us today, they held dinner parties and turned their backs on the gathering storm.  And who could blame the residents of Melbourne for ignoring the rest of a bomb-toasted world, in a spot this beautiful?  Let's have another iced coffee, and grill a barramundi, and invite Ava Gardner over for a few belts.  Spring is especially lovely just before a nuclear winter.    -- Rick
