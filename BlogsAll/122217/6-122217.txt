         I wrote my bio today.  It was for a company marketing vehicle.  Have you ever been asked to do that before? Have you ever done it and  not  felt like an ass?  Mine was kind of long. While I was writing it, it seemed alright. But when I finished and read it through once, it came across as kind of self-serving. So I made a few changes. The second run-through left me feeling pompous. So there were more changes. The third time, I thought to myself, "You are quite the ass."  I know bio's-- especially ones you write about yourself-- are probably going to be a little self-serving. That's part of the privilege of getting to tell your side of the story. But I was annoyed with the attitude I projected.  In the compression of a life from 30-odd years to 10 paragraphs, even modest achievements become little miracles. That's because there's no time for explaining how your best friend's cousin knew this person, who was a friend of someone in the business, who was able to put in a good word for you, and get you an internship at Company X. All of that becomes, "I went to work at Company X." It's almost as though you appeared in the lobby with doves, a halo and the voice of God: "This is my son, in whom I'm well pleased. Hire ye him." (To paraphrase the Holy text.)  After I finished agonizing over it, I decided that in the future I won't worry about it anymore. I'll just be a pompous ass. In fact, I'm going to make it all up from now on.  My new list achievements will include:  1) Knighthood by the King of Spain 2) A Grammy for Best Spoken Word Performance 3) Member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 4) Chairman, Pioneer High School PTO (well, it sort of brings me within reach of the unwashed.) 5) Iowa Pork Queen, 1996 6) Most Likely to Succeed, Harvard Class of 1989 and 7) Owner of Small Carribbean Island  I feel better already.
