         Hope you had a good one! Mine was a mix of quiet and some friend-type activities. I spent Saturday night and Sunday in Chicago. I took the 6 yo out to see his dad, who really misses him. it was nice to spend time with both of them.  Today has been a long day of sleeping generally and doing nothing, in particular. :) I love it!  Summer is over... and what a summer it's been. I don't know why it is but summers are always so hard for me. I get the least amount of sleep, work the hardest, have the least vacation time, and have some of the worst things happen along the way. I can think back to last summer... what a hothouse of emotions and possibilities that was with Dave. There was 1997... and one or two attempts with a wonderful guy named Curt. The one really big exception was the summer of 2000 with Chris. That was a really cool relationship that didn't go as far as I wanted it to... but maybe I only have myself to blame because I ended it. He's in Washington now and I still see him as much as I can.  This summer has been another hothouse with Dave. But the one good thing-- of many-- that can be said is that he and I are closer than we've ever been, despite kind of a wild ride. I'm a type A kind of guy so I prefer to know the answers and have the closure. But I've learned that in love-- and in this situation, in particular-- that's just not going to happen. Dave and I will be reassessing and asking each other questions and probing and talking for a long time to come. As friends, we'll probably do this for a lifetime. We might find ourselves doing it again as lovers, too. You just never know.  And that's the key.  You never know .
