          think I'm beginning to figure out what's wrong... I'm not getting the time I need to write as much as I would like to. This hasn't been very easy for me to figure out. But it finally made sense when I noticed that every time I've been restless, I've reached for my laptop to write email, or to update this journal... or some other writing-related activity. So maybe this is it. I need to give my self some extra time as much as possible to write more.  Not that I always have something interesting or thoughtful to write. Sometimes it's banal stuff. But I wrote a   cool friend  of mine tonight that I think there's something to be said for writing as much as possible... even when it isn't perfect. I think the more you write... the better you get. Write.. write... write... and the more you write the better you get to be with this most important of crafts.  Speaking of friends... Chrisonomicon is one of thousands of writers getting ready to take part in the   National Novel Writing Month . He and others will be trying to write 50,000 words during the month of November. It's a lofty goal... and well worth it, I think.  My other friend named Chris-- this is the one in DC-- has returned to his weblog after a long absence. It's about time!!! :) Ok... I'll lay off. I've taken long, unexplained vacations from my journal, too. But it's nice to have you back!  But I digress...  So yeah.. I need to set aside enough time to write a little every day... something like 750-1000 words. It's not a novel, but it doesn't have to be... just enough each day to empty some of the thoughts out of my head. Now if I can get to all that email I'm accumulating!
