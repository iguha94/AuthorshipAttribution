         ... another piece of good news.  A Fed rate cut and a record increase in the value of my stock portfolio. Now if only I hadn't lost so much in the first place!  And here's even more good news: the National Geographic cable channel launches this weekend!!  I don't know why I find this so exciting-- except that I''m really into the whole Shark/Polar Bear/Everest world of National Geographic specials on PBS. So, effective Sunday, there will be 24 hours of Sharks, Polar Bears and Everest.  All of this leaves me with a couple misgivings. First, like most people I barely have time to watch the amount of TV we Americans are apparently required by law to watch. Second, I wonder if I'll overdose on Borneo.  What else... oh! there's a new restaurant in Ann Arbor.  That's about as earth-shattering as the Pope's Catholicism, I know. But I gathered a group of friends last night to go check out the Sunflower Cafe. It's been open about a week.  Early projection: a B+.  It's one of those Macrobiotic, Vegan, Vegan, Whole Wheat, Noodle and Kukichi Tea type of places. I had noodles with Miso and Ginger-- just to remind myself why i don't like Miso all that much. My bf Chris had a pizza with onions and spinach. And my best pal Nersi had a veggie burrito.   Verdict: mmmmmm...  Plus it's only 2 blocks away from where I live. Which could mean a much more macrobiotic lifestyle in my future...
