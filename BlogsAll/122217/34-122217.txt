         I'm sitting in Cosi writing this... in the heart of the Philadelphia's gay district. Or whatever you call it. It's my first visit to the city and I must say it's not bad, although I like Washington better. But I've also been to Washington several times and so I'm probably letting my familiarity with the city cloud my judgment.  Still, it's alright. I'm staying at the Marriott downtown, so it was a walk about 6 blocks or maybe less to get here from there.  Next door is   Caribou ... so there are some cool places from my past to make me feel comfortable here.  I'm only here for a couple days... just a taste of the city. I'm making some work-related appearances. And I'm also here to moderate a   media panel  for   Pridefest . That panel is tomorrow night, so I've been using a chunk of the day today thinking about issues to have the panel members discuss.  The media coverage of the whole pedophilia thing will be a part of the mix. But my panel includes executives from   MTV  and   Showtime , so we'll probably discuss gay and lesbian characters on shows like   The Real World  and   Queer As Folk . And we'll also talk about the new gay cable network planned.  Geesh, Chris is right: the #30 sandwich at   Cosi  is great! Turkey, cranberry, romaine lettuce... mmmmm.  I know: how pathetic is this?!? It's 9:30pm on a Wednesday night and in a city with a bunch of great restaurants, I'm sitting in a coffee shop eating a sandwich.  Truth be told, I ruined myself today with a late lunch at the hotel. And for room service, it was actually pretty damn good. OK, OK... yes once again in a city with so many good restaurants, I ordered room service at the hotel. I'm so damn lame. :)
