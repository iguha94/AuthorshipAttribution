         I don't think I've written anything about this for the weblog. But in mid-June, I wrote my parents to tell them that I'm gay. It's been a long time coming. I've been out to myself for about 9 years. And most of my friends have known either since I met them, or as long as 5 years or so.  But my parents have been the only ones not to know. This has been mainly because of their devout Christian beliefs and their literal interpretation of the Bible. Well, I decided to change all that this year. So, for a number of reasons including the distance I live from them, I decided to write the to tell them I'm gay. A short while after that letter, I heard from them. Their letter expressed their love for me but their belief that I'm turning away from God to live a life of sin.  In the weeks since, I've delayed writing them to decide how to respond. So this weekend, I received another letter from my parents. This letter reiterates and emphasizes the points I've already mentioned. Here's some of it:    I think you've taken the world's way out. It's the world that tells you we can't fight it, then join it. But God gives us the strength to do what is right and godly. You mentioned that "knowing to do what's right is something that comes from God and our inner voice, not from others." Well, God didn't guide you in this direction, and if you were listening to him, you would know that his answer to us is never to give in to sin and to go the way of the world. Romans 1 tells us exactly what God thinks of the direction you are headed in, and that direction ends in spiritual and physical death.    As your parent, I cannot sit by and let you live in that sinful lifestyle without at least telling you what I know and what God's word says. Your only option is to flee this sinful lifestyle. You need to start reading your Bible, going to a gospel preaching church, and finding godly friends to encourage you and help you grow in your relationship with Christ.    I pray that you will be open to seeing the error of your ways, repent and come back to your relationship with Christ.    I've had a day or so to consider my response... which I'll include here:    Mom and Dad,    Thanks for your recent letters. Itâ€™s good to hear your opinions.    But frankly, Iâ€™m bothered by the continual implications that my friends are ungodly, that my lifestyle (of which youâ€™re unaware) is inappropriate, that Iâ€™m neglecting the scriptures, and that Iâ€™m going to a church thatâ€™s not right.    Letâ€™s consider some facts. First of all, I exist in the form that God made me. Second, homosexuality begins in the womb, either as a genetic trait (passed from the motherâ€™s side) or as the result of biological traitsâ€” chromosomal differences and testosterone among others. People donâ€™t choose it, and of all the ridiculous things, theyâ€™re not â€œrecruitedâ€ by other gay people. Youâ€™ve told me that God hasnâ€™t guided me in this direction. But you arenâ€™t qualified to speak on that issue. And neither is the Apostle Paul.    What do you think being gay is? And why are you using words like â€œgay lifestyleâ€ when you have no clue what that really means? Here, for instance, is the summary of my sinful lifestyle today: I had a cup of coffee. My neighbor and I went to the climbing gym. I played for about 3 hours with my roommate Daveâ€™s 4 year old son Gabe. Then I read for an hour, and had Chinese food downtown. Tonight, I tossed the football out back with Dave and his brother. Friday night, my â€œlifestyleâ€ consisted of going with Dave and Gabe to see Jurassic Park III.    My â€œgay lifestyleâ€ is going to work and studying. When I lived in Iowa, my â€œgay lifestyleâ€ included watching Mystery Science Theater with Ann and Dan on Friday nights and coming over to your place for Sunday dinner after church. And my â€œgay lifestyleâ€ includes my relationship with God and my time with the Bible.    Youâ€™ve advised me to fight this â€œsinful lifestyle.â€ But Iâ€™m fighting a different battle.    Iâ€™ve known what I am since I was a teenager. Back then, I was too scared and intimidated to say anything or to ask questions. My church, my school and my community were filled with softminded people, blinded by their own ignorance.    For 9 years now, Iâ€™ve understood myself and over time Iâ€™ve become aware of a path that God has opened up for me to take in life. Heâ€™s given me intelligence, a measure of integrity and a public position, where I can have influence. And so now itâ€™s time for me to stop being complacent about the things I see around meâ€”about things ignorant people do and the things they say. Young people whoâ€™ve been born with a trait they got in their motherâ€™s womb are being kicked out of their homes, beaten up on the playground, reviled by Christians whom Jesus called to love unconditionally, and called horrible names by their peers while teachers look the other way; and some young people die because others are ignorant and stupid. This is going to have to stop. My fight is against that kind of softmindedness.     Weâ€™re free to hold different views on these issues. But if youâ€™re going to say things to me about being gay, based on your own ignorance of what that is or your own reading of scripture, I recommend that first you take the time to educate yourselves.    Todd    This weblog is long enough, so I'll continue with this next time. I'm not sure why I find this so disturbing now... more than a month after my first letter to my parents. Maybe it's because I've decided to respond in a strong way to my parents. These are disturbing days... but we press on.
