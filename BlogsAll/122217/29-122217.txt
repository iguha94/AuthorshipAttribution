         I realize it was 20 years ago. I realize that 3.5 billion people have seen the film. I understand that bushpeople from remote Australian tribes, who don't have TV and have never owned a Sony product, have seen it.  The fact remains: I've never seen   E.T.   But tonight, all that changes. My bf, his 5 yo son and three other witnesses will be with me as I watch E.T. for the first time.  Oh... and while you're still shocked... I just saw   The Godfather  for the first time this weekend. Here's the deal: I grew up in a very religious household, where going to the movies was frowned upon. We watched TV. And when certain movies came to TV, my brothers and I were allowed to watch them. The problem, as far as I can tell, was the theater-- and it wasn't the inflated candy prices.  My mom and dad seemed to believe that dark theaters were places where things happened that wouldn't be happening if the theater were lit like an operating room. Now as young kids, we had no idea what this meant. Heck, I'm 34 and I  still  don't really know. This must have meant courtin' and sparkin'. Or whatever those randy kids call it today.  So... I was in a theater to see a movie probably 3 times in the first 21 years of my life-- I kid you not. One of those times was to see "The Ten Commandments." Another time was to see "  In Search of Noah's Ark ." This was the epic documentary detailing the evidence that Noah's Ark is still up on Mount Ararat, remarkably preserved. Oh yes, there it is, we murmured as our eyes tried to bore holes through the grainy, blurry photographs of some strange blob on the side of Ararat. For all I know, it was the Loch Ness Monster. It's remarkable that people can afford to travel to remote parts of the world in search of answers to the great mysteries of our time... and neglect to buy a quality zoom lens.
