         A quiet weekend... waking early to do laundry and clean the house... and then go right back to bed. Now what was the sense of that? It can't be helped. I suffer from the weird assumption that if I get up after 8am on a Saturday, then I'm a lazy bum. Well, by that measure, I've been quite lazy lately. But this morning, I was up at 6:45am and promptly back in bed at 10am.  D  arrived from Chicago at 1pm and he joined me within minutes of walking through the door. We slept till 6:30pm... the blissful sleep one experiences with the man he loves lying next to him.   D  has his 10th high school reunion tonight... and then I'll drive him back to Chicago tomorrow.  This may be how our lives will be for a while. I'd like  D  to move back. But I won't ask him to turn away so quickly from the opportunities that Chicago offers. If you've had a long distance relationship before, you know better than I do the impact it has. I have a friend who lives in San Francisco and who's partner lives in Connecticut. For the last 5 years, they've seen each other on weekends and for longer periods when they can. They've managed to maintain a tight, monogamous relationship. That's one example of some I'm aware of.  I'm more uncertain about it. A lot of questions go through my mind. The biggest ones are these: how does a relationship grow when you see each other only on Saturday and Sunday? What about Monday through Friday?  D  needs to make some decisions in the next few days, so we'll have a lot to talk about tomorrow on the way to Chicago.  But tonight, at least, there's the comfort of his arms.
