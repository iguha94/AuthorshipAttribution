:: SIX O'CLOCK ::    Timeline:  Present  "Come Speak to Me" as performed by Elisa.     Love me at 6 O'clock sharp!     You the minute, I the hour hand...   So that no matter how opposite we may fall   We can still make sense on a straight plain.      Come speak to me easy like hands on skin.  Come speak to me easy like sky on earth.  We are going to do something if you come and tell me just how you feel  'Cause we are gonna work it out  Even if your world's falling apart  Are you gonna do something?  Are you gonna trust me?  Are you gonna take care of what I've been given?   Are you?    Birds are crying for the two of us  I can't sleep 'cause the Moon reminds me of your face  And now I can see sunsets on my homeland  Through your words still  Alive!   Come speak to me easy like hands on skin  Do you know why I left?  It's 'cause I was digging into my past  Are you gonna do something?  Are you listening to me?  Are you gonna take care of what I've been given?  Are you,  Are you?   Birds are crying for the two of us  I can't sleep 'cause the Moon reminds me of your face  And now I can see sunsets on my homeland  'Cause your words are Alive!    The sun keeps telling mysteries  (Are you listening to me? Are you?)  The moon keeps telling me stories (Are you gonna take care of what I've been given?)   Come speak to me, come speak to me, Come speak to me!    Now, come speak to me...
