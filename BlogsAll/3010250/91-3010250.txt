Timeline:  Present  I am trying to pick up the answers to the questions: Why is it that whenever I find myself deeply involved in and dedicated to a project, I am always faced by egos of others?, what am I doing to wake up the  beast  in them? and how do I overcome this struggle of opposites through Love's path?  The last question's answer is specifically important because in all the projects I have been, compromise turned out to be a toilsome concept which is closely related to the underlying human belief, "It is impossible to make everyone happy". I choose to believe that it  is  possible to make everyone happy as long as everyone has the same destination. What is arduous is the "convincing" course and this course is the outcome of people who share your destination but are determined to choose their own path in reaching it.  In this case, I choose to free them. Because, I choose to believe, that is the greatest opportunity I can hand out to another. I do not persist on keeping people "together" but instead I encourage them "to gather" their own tools and set sail on their own.  This leads to separateness, for certain.  This leads to break-ups.  This leads to letting go.  Then again, I do not choose to attribute them the negativity we usually link them to.   The prerequisite is to consciously accept that no thing or no one is my  property . When I think out of the box, they are simply there to experience "themselves" via me and I attract them to my reality in order to experience "myself" via them.  My greatest err in my journey would be to try to keep someone from reflecting and expressing his/her great vision about him/herself. If that perfection does not include  mine , if the river comes to a fork, why attempt to block the other branch's run in the hope that its waters will eventually be tamed (suppressed!) and flow in harmony with mine? (Moreover, would I prefer harmony of that kind?)  Setting someone free is a mutual gift in that sense.
