PROLOGUE    THE EYES OF AURA MARS        EPISODE I : Early Years      :: A PREMATURE BEGINNING ::     Timeline:  Past  To tell you the truth, up until the point of birth, I actually tried a few times to suicide as soon as I realized that I got transferred to the wrong womb. The officials at "Neverland Transport" hadn't quite liked me, I knew that much, but this was taking the sarcasm a bit too far. Not only this cord was getting more painful by day but also there was something sticking out from my crotch that shouldn't be there. I was a female and they were going to stuck me in a male body!   As soon as I realized this mistake, I plotted my revenge as well as my suicide. Balling my hands into fists, I tried my first attempt of ending this nonsense during the woman's 5th month into pregnancy. I was very close to success, too.. But the woman was so unbelievably determined that as soon as I kicked open the entry into the womb, she got herself stitched! No kidding! I saw fingertips moving faster than a speeding bullet while they "patchworked" her insides to prevent me from getting out.   Thus, I found myself literally imprisoned and, day after day, loosing my hopes to return where I come from. Every second was bringing me closer to a life where I was to live somebody else's life instead of the one I chose among thousands in the Neverland. Darn they had some offerings for me! Said I had nice karma points thus I could choose a life falling into the Movie Star/High Society Trash category.   A gold tooth sparkled as I grinned and skipped myself merrily towards the station. But this... was highly unexpected. Could it be the guy who was sitting next to me on the plane's doing? I barely remember to leave my seat to take a leak and there were screams coming from the outside saying something about Interdimensional terrorists. Oh well... Lights went off, the floor shook, I think I fell and hit my forehead to something thus passed out.   And here I was... Approaching to somebody else's life. They were months of despair, indeed. Growing sadness until I realized that there just could be one more way out of this. If I could not get out then I could get myself killed within! And the easiest way was to do it was to blood-fill the womb. But how??? The walls of the womb were way too thick for me to tear or damage. Rising my head, I realized that I could try pulling the cable down. Thus on the 25th of November, around 23:46, I cord-attacked the womb thus caused blood pour in.   Oh what a blissful moment that was. I closed my eyes, smiled and waited patiently for the blood to reach above my nostrils....   ....Until blinding light obscured my vision. I felt hands grabbing my still weak baby body while my memory escaping me fast. I gasped as the first molecule of oxygen sneaking into my lungs and screamed...   ... thus on 26th of November at 00:05, I drastically failed at the first struggle against my Fate.
