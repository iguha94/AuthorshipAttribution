:: COSMOPOLITAN HOURS ::   Timeline:  Present   After a sleepless night (hectic night) due to my father's cold (barely visible symptoms) and my being a truehearted daughter (Auralance Nightingale), I welcomed (cursed) yesterday morning in front of the mirror and found out (boiled with rage) that the knitted pullover I had bought the other day to cover the   Frankie B .ish cut of my jeans (the upper sections of my ass cheeks - I fell prey to the salesperson pampering: "Gee this is just the right cut for you!".. Uh-huh. Just as long as I'm standing!) perfectly suited its purpose (cover the ass cheeks) but it was so loosely knitted that the upper sections of some other body parts (was it over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder, Bette -Midler-?) were seen through.   Having no time left, I wore my brand new (Rain Man's present) Nike convertible (every present of his has at-least-two-birds-with-a-stone theme: "Oh Rain! It's such a lovely pullover!" -- "Not only a pullover but also.... *unbuttons the back*... a raincoat!" -- "Oh awesome! This is..." -- "Not only a raincoat but also.... *unzips the front*... a glove-scarf-beret set!" -- "My this is incredible, I'm.." -- "Not only a set but also... *shakes the sides off* ... a rocket launcher!") jacket over it and rushed out (No nothing happened because of the pullover if you don't count people men racing to seat themselves logistically at the bus so as to take a peek at my cleavage and my overall embarrassment since I'm not a full time exhibitionist but a victim of mindless shopping in this case).   Thankfully, Sister G. (my more-than-a-friend of 15 years. The only married member of my Holy Quartet*) and I were going to be all alone at her house and it was going to be a night full of girl moments (her husband had a night shift at the hospital) so it was perfectly alright. Highlights from the night include:   + How men change once they get married.  + Why men change once they get married?  + Shit! Men change once they get married!   + Wedding photos  + Wedding albums  + Engagement photos  + Engagement albums   + Class of 94' Yearbook:   - Who's this?  - Err... can't remember.  - Maybe we should try another angle.   - Let's call X!  - It's 10 years.. Do you think he/she'll remember?  - We remember him/her, right? [dialing silence] Hello ma'am/sir. I'm Sister G... X's friend from No-Longer-Available High, can I talk to him/her please?    Answers at hand after 10 calls :   X is married.  X doesn't live here any more.  X is at the hospital giving birth to her triplets.  How would I know where X is?! That )%+&'&!^+ bastard!  X has migrated to Alaska.  I don't know where X is. X rarely drops by anymore.  Forget X and talk to me babe!  Who?  + What women sacrifice to get married?  + What women sacrifice to remain married?  + Why women sacrifice to have a piece of paper that says they can get laid officially by a specific male anyway?   + The right time to fall pregnant  + The wrong time to fall pregnant  + The best position to fall pregnant  + Condoms vs. Contraceptives  + Contraceptives vs. IUDs  + Oh well I'm married! (Benefits of unprotected sex)   + Being overweight  + Being underweight  + Dead hair ends  + How to achieve shimmering highlights?  + Natural hair masks  + Natural facial masks  + Tribute to Cosmetics.   + Final Credits (at 4 am)   Main Idea: The monitor is swaying back & forth, my eyes ere burning, my entire system is craving to curl up right here right now and sleep for a day week month but it was all worth it.   Supporting Idea: No lack of sleep, no hangover, no nothing could keep me away from my journal.   Conclusion: I'll regret having said that tomorrow.     *Holy Quartet : Those who are dearest to me; Namely Charon, Rain Man, Sister G. and Solara.
