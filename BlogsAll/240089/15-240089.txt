alright, so i probably should have been studying since i got back to my apartment (which was around 6pm), but instead i watched arizona make it into the NLCS and then i started to play mah jong solitaire... well, i just got my best score ever of 216,345 (i died on round 21), which makes me ranked 4th for the day and 100th for the month.  i'm pretty damn proud... but apparently there's going to be a lil drinking party at my place this weekend so the guys can check my place out and so we can also play worms completely hammered.  so chris, don't forget to bring your psx and worms and i'll buy some beer and some snacks on friday.  john, try to get some more hard stuff and some mixers and try to get dave to come along too.  and if dave comes, get him to bring some hard stuff too.   directions to my place (it's basically the same as for my last place): 91e to 215s/60e (towards Indio), exit spruce at the stop sign, make a left and keep on spruce until you hit Iowa (the 2nd light) make a right on Iowa, but then make a right at the next light (Massachusetts) make a right at the first driveway you see and now you should be in my complex go over one speedbump, and make a right the first apartment on the right is mine (1311, #205) i'll have my orange cones on my balcony and my windows open with the music blasting you can park in any uncovered spot, but if you can't find any just pull up in front of my staircase (it's the one with the fake spiderweb on it) and i'll find you a place to park if you get lost, call (909)275-0378  i'll post these directions at the end of the week and one more thing, are we doing this friday night or saturday night?
