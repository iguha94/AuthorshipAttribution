my patient (i.e. the one i put the arterial line in) isn't doing so well. he's going into kidney failure, he's got pneumonia,  we can't control his heart rate or blood pressure, and we'll probably have to intubate him tomorrow.  i just watched him lie there, his wife by his side, her face full of fear and sadness but too brave to cry.  she looks lost, longing for the days of their youth when they were both healthy and happy but now staring at her love's deteriorating exterior.  he's normally very confused and practically comatose: just a body, hooked up to machines, that only moves when someone is trying to stick yet another needle in him.  but when she's there, he's like his old self.  he responds to commands and can communicate very well for someone as sick as he is. and considering he's blind in both eyes, just the gentle caress of her hand on his and her soothing voice is enough for him to muster the energy to show her, that while not looking so great, he's still there and fighting.  when i check up on him in the morning, i hold his hand as i'm examining him... so he can feel some semblance of humanity.  and when i saw his wife's eyes start water and her facade about to crack as my attending was explaining his worsening condition, i just wanted to give her a hug and tell her it's going to be all ok. God will make sure he's healthy again in this life, if not the next...
