ok so i have a midterm in histology tomorrow and i have  a lot  of material to cover so i'm not going to be responding to any IMs sent my way.  but i did feel obligated to mention that today in the cadaver lab i used the bone saw on the skull and i actually removed the skull cap.  so after i sawed thru that sucker i used my trusty wooden mallet and a chisel to pry off the skull cap.  interestingly enough, my body is the only one in the class to actually have a metal plate in her head.  it looked more like metal meshwork than an actual slab of metal, and it came off a lot easier than i had anticipated.  and once the metal plate was off, i was looking right at her brain.  anyhow, once i pried off the skull cap i cut off the outer membrane of the brain (the inner dura mater... the outer dura mater is fused with the internal periosteum of the skull) and just started messing with the brain.  i was supposed to cut more off of the skull so i could actually remove the brain, but i wanted to leave lab early so i could go study histology.  so on friday i'll go into detail on how i removed the brain... oh yea, i don't know when was the last time you went to the dentist and he actually drilled your teeth, but considering bone and teeth are made of the same material (hydroxyapatite, or calcium phosphate that has incorporated water into its crystal lattice... but teeth are modified to be harder than bone) when i was sawing into the skull it smelled the same as when you get your teeth drilled.  plus on one part of the skull i pushed too deep with the saw and accidently went into the brain and when i did, a whole mess of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) came out.  the really bad part was that it was draining over the area i needed to saw thru next so when i tried to cut thru it, CSF was splattering all over the place.  luckily i had a surgical mask and some goggles...
