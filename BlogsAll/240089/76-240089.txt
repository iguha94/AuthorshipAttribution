forgot to mention that the night i saw the matrix chris, vinicio, and i stopped off at the mad greek in corona and ran into kristin's grandparents (the girl i took to winter formal and the prom and then subsequently quasi-dated for the next 2 years or so).  well, they go to my (old) church where my dad still attends and they told him that kristin is getting married this saturday... to a late 20s half-black, half-mexican man who already has 3 kids.  i've only met the man once and i haven't spoken to her in over 6 months, but DAAAAAAAAAAMN.  she always told me the only way her mom would let her move out of the house was if she got married, so i wonder if this has anything to do with her decision... especially since i've heard they really like to argue with one another.  an interesting note about this was kristin and her family for some reason attended my college graduation (i sent them an invite to my graduation party, but they showed up to the ceremony) and kristin was acting very flirtacious towards me... that is, until i introduced heidi to them all.  oddly enough, two weeks later at church she had her future husband.  so in my ego-centric mind, she saw that i finally had someone and was no longer interested in her (which i hadn't for quite some time, but it was just easier for me to try to date her occasionally than make the effort to meet new people), so she tried to one-up me and say, "hey, i'm not interested in you either." oh well... and although i doubt kristin is marrying this guy just for love (i'm basing this off of absolutely no solid information other than my own mind's meanderings), i hope it works out for her... the whiny, frigid bitch that she is.  haha     yes, i know that was mean... but c'mon.  i enjoyed it immensely
