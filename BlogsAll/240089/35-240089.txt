first off, happy valentines day... apparently just another day in my life, but i'm ok with that.  well, i woke up this morning feeling like shit: congested nose, sore throat, slight fever.  so my nerdy mind went to work... i was thinking i had an upper respiratory tract infection.  i still went to class even though i really didn't feel up to it, but the sad thing is that i wouldn't have missed anything had i not gone (well, except that interleukin-1 is why you get a fever and it's the cytokines you produce that make you feel like shit when you're sick, not the actual infection).  i'm telling ya, physio is getting painful and immuno just covers all the crap that never wanted to know.  so right now i'm studying for my quiz in medical microbiology, and i don't think that the quiz is going to be all that difficult.  but there's still a lot that i have to memorize so i'm gonna have to cut this short.  and one disturbing thing i've learned over the past week: the family guy and futurama are cancelled.  futurama i can handle; but not the family guy.  it's like the funniest show in the history of television (especially since the simpsons have been going downhill over the past couple of seasons), and i hope that if fox doesn't change its mind that maybe comedy central will pick it up and make new episodes or at least play reruns.  and then i realized something especially frightening now that futurama and the family guy are going off the air: with the impending end of the simpsons (which has maybe another season left), the only animated show on fox will be king of the hill... how horrible is that?  ah ok, now i gotta go study.  but i did find out that the 2nd season of the simpsons is coming out in mid-may...
