this is such an awesome story... a no-hitter is a news making achievement; a perfect game is historical (for those who don't know, no hitter means you didn't give up a hit but you either gave up walks or batters reached on errors by the fielders; a perfect game is no batter got to first the entire game... you can throw a no-hitter and still lose (e.g. walk the first four batters while your team ends not scoring at all) but you always win if you throw a perfect game)  This Day in Dodger History September 9, 1965 Sandy Koufax reaches the pinnacle of his remarkable career as he fires what remains the only perfect game in franchise history, a 1-0 masterpiece over the Chicago Cubs before 29,139 fans at Dodger Stadium.  Koufax, who had already thrown three no-hitters during his Hall of Fame career, struck out 14 Cubs, including the final six to come to the plate. One of the batters to strike out in the ninth inning was pinch-hitter Joe Amalfitano, who struck up a brief conversation with the next hitter, Harvey Kuenn, as he walked back to the dugout.  "Be ready up there," Amalfitano warned. Responded Kuenn: "Save me a seat; Ill be right back."  The game featured high drama for both teams as Cubs left-hander Bob Hendley nearly matched Koufaxs stellar performance by allowing just one hit  Lou Johnsons bloop-single -- and a walk.  The Dodgers run came in the fifth inning when Johnson opened with a walk, went to second on Ron Fairlys sacrifice, stole third and scored on the same play when catcher Chris Krugs throw sailed into left field.  Koufax became the first pitcher in major league history to throw four no-hitters. One of the most dominating pitchers of his era, Koufax was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972 in his first year of eligibility.
