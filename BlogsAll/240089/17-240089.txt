i read two rather disturbing articles in the LA Times today, with the first having to do with this dentist that essentially made an assembly line out of her patients... apparently she would first give her patients (mostly children and teens) as much as 6 times the recommended dosage of the oral sedative chloral hydrate, turning it into a general anesthetic.  she would dope up 3-5 patients at a time, most oftentimes not even weighing them to make sure the dose she gave wasn't lethal, and then would work on them one after another while not even bothering to change her gloves.  one of her patients actually had a heart attack while sedated and was clinically dead for 28 minutes, but now has massive brain damage.  the judge for the case? lance ito: the mr. komatsu look-a-like from the o.j. trial.  the other story involved this dermatologist whose wife was going to divorce him and he didn't want to lose all of his assets (valued at $5 million), so he shot her in the head with a rifle while his children where in the house.  his lawyers said that he was suffering from temporary insanity, and that this insanity was manifested in his secret cross-dressing and his taking birth control pills to try to make him more feminine (such as growing breasts specifically), as well as using his laser hair removal instruments to remove, well, his body hair.  needless to say, the jury didn't buy his story and he was convicted of first degree murder.
