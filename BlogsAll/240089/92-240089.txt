i'm a nerd, i know.  and as such, i like learning the etymology (i.e. origin) of english words.  like i said, i'm a nerd.  so i spent some time today figuring out how the months of the year got their names.  not surprising, all of the months were borrowed from Latin via French due to the Norman Invasion of England in 1066 (remember William the Conqueror?).  so the following list consists of the current month, what it means, and what month it replaced in Old English:   January   means:  Month of Janus--God of endings and beginnings  replaced:  Later Yule--Yule is a pagan winter holiday of feasting later replaced by Christmas  February    means:  Month of Purification--Roman feast of purification  replaced:  Mud month   March   means:  Month of Mars--God of war  replaced:  Active, Ready Month	      April   means:  Month of Aphrodite--Goddess of love  replaced:  Easter Month--Easter is a pagan goddess of fertility  May   means:  Month of Maya--Goddess of Earth  replaced:  Three milk--Month in which cows can be milked three times a day  June   means:  Month of Juno--Goddess of women and marriage  replaced:  Earlier Mildness--Reference to England's summers  July   means:  Month of Julius--Named in honor of Julius Caesar  replaced:  Later Mildness  August   means:  Month of Augustus--Named in honor of Augustus Caesar  replaced:  Weed Month  September   means:  Seventh Month--Roman calendars started in March  replaced:  Harvest Month  October   Means:  Eighth Month  replaced:  Winter feast  November   means:  Ninth Month  replaced:  Blood Month--Month of animal sacrifice  December	   means:  Tenth Month  replaced:  Earlier Yule
