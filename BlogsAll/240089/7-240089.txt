after careful deliberations, i have added "tv funhouse" to the list of my favorite tv shows... i highly recommend you watch it.  here's a bit of a skit they did called "the safety gang," in which actual 10/11yr. olds talked about safety: Host: It's time to dive head first into a shallow pool of safety with The Safety Gang Donny: My name's Donny, and i don't drink poison... everyday!!! Marcy: Marcy's my name and i always never spray window cleaner in my eyes!!! Cubby: ( coming out of a garbage bag ) Hi, I'm Cubby... and I know that people can fly if they jump off a 20 story building ledges but only if they have special powers, which actually no one does!!! Marcy: Rush into safety Donny: Safety's a reflex Cubby: Do it blindly!! Marcy: Now it's time to talk to Stranger Dan about safety.  Hi Stranger Dan, what have you got for us? Stranger Dan: ( in a real seedy voice ) Candy Marcy: Yummy ( eats candy )... Today's Stranger Dan Safety Tip is to "Never don't not forget to look both ways when crossing the street."  Thanks, Stranger Dan... Got to go. Stranger Dan: I can give you a ride in my van... All Kids Together: I'd take a bullet for safety.  you can download the enitre thing, look for TV Funhouse - The Safety Gang... i also suggest TV Funhouse - Mnemonics 2 and Mnemonics 3.  DAMP #43:  having anal sex is a lot like fishing a watch out of a port-a-potty...  either way, use protection
