while i said i didn't enjoy certain aspects of surgery, i'd still go into it.  however, there's no fucking way i'm doing internal medicine. i'm on the outpatient portion of it, so all i'm doing is clinic.  i had a patient today who complained of pain in every fucking joint and almost started to whine during the physical exam.  and it's not like she had obvious signs of arthritis or trauma... she just hurt.  so we gave her the diagnosis of fibromyalgia: basically she's got so many complaints (in addition to her psych issues) that we gave her this bullshit of a diagnosis.  (this diagnosis is basically for those people that we have no idea what is causing their pain).  but as i was talking to her, she was just rambling on and on and on about this, about that... and then she'd think of another thing that was bothering her!!! AAARRRGGGHHH!!! so i'm basically figuring out what the hell i want to do.  here's the tentative list (in descending order): 1) urology--i'm gonna have to do research to get this one 2) pathology--i would have put it first, but i want to see what it's like before i put it at the top of the list 3) general surgery--i'd have to do it at uci or harbor... no fucking way i'm doing it at ucla 4) pediatrics--not too intense, it's a crash course in medicine.  but i'd have to specialize afterwards 5) family medicine--haven't done it yet, but i figure i'd specialize in sports medicine or just set up shop near the beach 6) internal medicine--oh god.  i'd have to try to find a low-key residency and then try to specialize.  very unlikely though, especially since i hate long soap notes (i.e. patient documentation notes) X) neurology, psych, ob/gyn--no fucking way is this shit happening...
