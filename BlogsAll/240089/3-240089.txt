good morning, lovers... anyhow, i guess erika's parents saw her crying and knew that she had to tell them something very important, so they assumed that chris got her pregnant.  what it really happened was that her laptop got stolen... but how funny that they assumed that chris did it.  well while i'm here, might as well give you DAMP #19:  Oh, you think you're so high and mighty just because you were never arrested for driving without any pants  like chris' little list on what to say to end an argument with women, try saying this one too... good times.  i got really sunburned yesterday but i'm still going to the beach today to get even more crisp   Here's something i just thought up:  We often use the baseball analogy when describing how far we've gotten sexually with another person.  for a long time, this was the standard code for how well you did: 1st base: holding hands 2nd base: kiss on the lips 3rd base: making out home plate: sexual intercourse  However, nowadays people are doing more things earlier in the relationship, so i (along with some assistance from loveline) have determined a new and more accurate code for how well you did: 1st base: handjob 2nd base: blowjob 3rd base: cornholin' (so those women who are virgins can technically  stay  virgins) home plate: standard vaginal intercourse, may also involve toys, female ejaculate, any of the above three sexual acts, and other people and/or animals  Now i realize that not every swing of the bat will get a hit let alone a homerun, so here's some additional terminology and strategy for all the other possible things that can happen in the game of lovin': foul ball: you're trying to get a hit (and by hit i mean any type of lovin') and she turns you down, but you get to try again right away foul out: same as above, but you don't get to try again bunt: you try to sneak your way to a handjob walk: she's having some control problems, so you get a free handjob intentional walk: she figures if left up to you, you'll probably end up in her ass (i.e. a triple) so she gives you a handie just to satisfy you for this at-bat force out: you were trying to go up one base, but got shot down error: she's probably drunk and lets you get a free base when normally you'd be out  i'll come up with more later, but i need to eat some breakfast
