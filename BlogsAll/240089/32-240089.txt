decided to take a break from studying to impart some knowledge and, well, common courtesy.  i interviewed a standardized patient (i.e. an actress portraying a patient) today in which her LDL ("bad") cholesterol was too high, her HDL ("good") cholesterol was too low, she smokes a pack and a half a day, she barely exercises (i.e. walking in the mall while she shops on saturdays), and has a family history of heart disease.  i suggested that she just mildly change her behavior by buying low-fat snack foods, low-fat salad dressing, and chicken or turkey instead of steak and ground beef, by exercising a bit more, and by cutting down on her smoking.  and of course, to everything i suggested she said that she was either too busy or her son wouldn't like that food or blah blah blah blah blah.... GODDAMMIT!!!! I'M TRYING TO KEEP YOU ALIVE A FEW MORE YEARS AND MAYBE EVEN PREVENT YOU FROM HAVING SURGERY OR TAKE MEDICATION!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!  for you non-med people, i just can't fully convey the degree of my frustration and anger with this noncompliant tart....  i just want to beat the crap out of something or run so hard that my arteries pump acid...  and i got this frustrated over a bleepin' actress!  an  ACTRESS!!!  when i actually have real patients and this happens it's going to be even worse... damn damn damn damn damn.   so here's some advice for you all:  be honest with your doctor...that includes your sexual history and  any and all  drugs (prescription, over-the counter, elicit, or herbal remedies).  and please please please do what he/she says even if you don't think it's best (well, if that's the case, get a second opinion and if the diagnoses are the same... then follow orders)....  this is one of the [many] reasons why doctors become disillusioned with what they do...  and to add to this frustration, i have to get back to studying for renal... crap
