in case you hadn't heard,  i got into medical school...  and just so you guys know what school i'm going to and all, here's the low down:  the biomedical sciences program at UCR provides a 7 year course to a bachelor's (B.S.) and medical (M.D.) degree instead of the traditional 8 year program.  the premise of the program is a pyramid; many more students enter into the program than will finish it.  for the first four years, the number of students in any particular will halve each year.  my class had 250 students my 1st year, 105 my 2nd year, and 48 my 3rd year.  next year, there will be only 24 and there will remain 24 throughout the remainder of the program.  the first 3 three years of the program are the undergraduate portion, whereas the final 4 are the actual medical school portion; however, the first 2 years (the classroom portion) of the medical school portion are at UCR while the final 2 years (the clinical portion) are at UCLA.  so all and all, 5 years are spent in riverside (3 as undergrads, 2 as med students) and 2 years at LA.  at the end of my 4th year, i will attend the graduation ceremony for the undergrad portion and at the completion of the program (at year 7), i will receive an M.D. from UCLA i hoped this cleared it up some... anyways, i'm pretty damn enthusiastic about this and i feel like they made a mistake... like they sent me the wrong letter and accidently sent me the one that says i made it. eww, that would suck ass.  but today i'm gonna go with dave to see the dodgers kick some giant ass (for the ill-informed, they are gonna play the san francisco giants and not some big buttocks) and hopefully we can get a free dodger noisemaker.  i've talked too much already so i'm gonna say one more thing and then i'm outta here.  DAMP # 24:  Militants, huh?  Well, if I were you I'd kick their asses...
