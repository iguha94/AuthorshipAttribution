1) i'm glad i'm not the one marrying kristin 2) she's whiny because that's all she ever did whenever we were dating or weren't dating... hell, at the formal (we went only as friends), she whined about her parents the whole time 3) she's frigid because she's ultra-conservative... for a long time she felt that the first boy she kissed was going to be the man she married. 4) regardless of how many years i've not been interested in her, there's still that feeling amongst others that i'm just longing to go back to her.  and the more i say i'm not interested in her, the more people believe the opposite. it's that whole situation of "you're in denial," "no, i'm not," "see, i told you you're in denial." believe me... the more i got to know her, the more i realized she was exactly what i didn't want in a woman. 5) i'm more shocked that she's getting married at this age to a man who already has three kids 6) THIS BLOG GETS THE COMMENTS!?!?  nothing about gay's island: dick's last resort or the christmas porno of your choice? damn... i'm gonna have reevaluate my whole blog now...  but regardless of what bullshit i write, it still breaks down to the fact that a girl that i was interested in found the man that she's going to spend the rest of their life with, and that man wasn't me.  i don't wish it was me, but at the same time i'd be lying if i said it didn't hurt a little. plus it also shows how my career path has forced me into a land where i don't get to do every bit of living that i wish i was doing... that other people get to enjoy life.  i have a good 6 years before life becomes what i want it to be... so let's all move on in the discussion onto more pertinent matters.  like vinicio suggested earlier, VODKA!!!
