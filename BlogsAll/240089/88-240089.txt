well, the dodgers sale was just approved to one Frank McCourt.  and i don't know what to make of it.  Fox (as in the television network) was just starting to make the right moves in terms of re-establishing the farm system and getting the dodgers back to how they work best: pitching.  however, their control of the dodgers has been a headache, seeing as they traded away mike piazza and brought in a number of horrible players (carlos perez comes to mind).  but this Frank McCourt... i dunno.  he was unable to buy the red sox (they eventually went for $700 mil), but he also was unable to  buy the angels (which sold for $180 mil).  so he's somehow able to purchase the dodgers for $430 mil?  this doesn't make sense to me.  true, the final deal ended up with him purchasing 52% of the team for $230 mil, but the rumors are that he bought it mostly with loans.  i mean, this is a guy who isn't on forbes richest list trying to buy a team with a lot of extras solely on loans.  my understanding is that his only asset is a couple waterfront acres in a ritzy part of boston that is worth a lot of money... except that they're undeveloped.  so this sale could end up being great for the dodgers or, as i anticipate, rip-your-prostate-out  horrible. which brings me to my goal in life: i will own the dodgers (or at least a good part of it).  i don't know how, but i will own them.
