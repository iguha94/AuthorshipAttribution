my mom showed me this nice little article from the OC Register in which it said how mexican vanilla extract may not be true vanilla due to their lax labelling laws... so the vanilla you get from mexico may be real, imitation, or not even vanilla but instead distillations from the tonka bean.  now here's where it gets nasty:  the tonka bean is loaded full of coumarins.  "what the hell is that?" you say.  well, coumarins are a class of molecules that are anticoagulants (i.e. they make you bleed) by inhibiting your liver from making the vitamin K coagulation factors.  so basically you can't clot your blood.  now you may think that you need not worry as long as you don't get cut, but let's think about that for a minute.  basically everything you do can cause you to bleed.  eating... acid gets secreted, so you could develop ulcers in your stomach or small intestine.  walking... you're putting a lot of weight on your joints, so bleeding into joints is a serious problem.  sleeping... you... uh... could... uh... fall off your bed and land on something sharp.  so anyhow, coumarins are used in medicine for this purpose.  the principle one, warfarin, is used in long term treatment of lung clots, deep vein clots, and congenital pro-coagulation states (factor V leiden, prothrombin 20210A), as well as in therapies for people post-heart attack and post-stroke.  but coumarins are also used in rat poison.  rats can't vomit, so they have to absorb it and then they bleed to death.  you can treat coumarin toxicity by taking vitamin K, but have fun getting it yourself cuz it's the only vitamin not sold over the counter.  the only other way to treat it is to get infused with fresh frozen blood plasma at a couple thousand dollars per bag... basically, go to the doctor either way.   but good times, and just watch where your vanilla extract came from.  (the vanilla rum that i made had madagascar vanilla beans, so it was ok)
