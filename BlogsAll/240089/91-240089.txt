i had an interesting night last night.  after hanging out with pete and his gf's sister (courtney) at a bar in fullerton, courtney and i went back to her dad's house and we ended up watching a movie until the wee hours of the morn.  but when i left, i noticed a black plume of smoke coming from the direction of el dorado high school, which is about two blocks from her dad's house.  so i drive behind the school and i see a couple flames in between two buildings... i wasn't sure if it was a building or a dumpster on fire, so i decided to drive to the front of the school so i could see if the fire dept. was there yet.  when i got to the front of the school, i noticed that not only were no fire trucks at the school but on the same street as the high school there's a fire station.  i tried to get a better look at the fire, but my view was still obstructed and i could see that the flames, while not coming from a main building, were awfully close to what looked like the administration building.  so i called 911 and waited for the fire trucks to roll up before i took off.  it probably was just a dumpster, but i feel good about myself... although i doubt the kids that attend el dorado don't feel so great about me calling 911.
