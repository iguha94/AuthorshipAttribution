i just saw a commercial that said that i should stop wasting my money on hard pill vitamins because most of them don't get absorbed into your body.  the spokesman (portrayed as a doctor, although you don't know if he's supposed to be a MD, chiropractic, or herbal doctor) then poured some pills into a glass of water and said, "this mimics your body." he then proceeded to stir the fluid with a glass stirring rod, although he only stirred the water above the vitamins and never actually moved the vitamins.  then they showed a picture of the vitamins "2 hours later" with the vitamins still intact and used that as proof that hard pill vitamins are just a waste of money.  they then showed their liquid vitamin mix and had some testimonials about how healthy these people are now that they use this liquid vitamin mix... i just have a few problems with is: 1)  if you're going to mimic your intestines with a liquid, use a liquid that actually is in your intestines... highly acidic at first, then alkaline, but always full of digestive enzymes... and unless they have some funky tap water, i doubt they used anything near what your body secretes 2)  if your intestines only swished around the fluid in their lumens, we'd all be dead from starvation...  so the "doctor's" crappy attempt at mixing the solution was duly noted 3)  last time i checked, it took about 8 hours for food to go from mouth to anus... so if you're only at 2 hours, man you got some massive diarrhea 4)  how often do you find vitamins still intact in your feces? i mean, it's not like it's corn or anything 5)  there's only two ways vitamins can effect your health: you're deficient or you're in excess.  taking extra vitamins on a western diet will not make you healthier.  and you're most likely not vitamin deficient unless you have some major symptoms, such as night blindness or loose teeth with bleeding gums or rickets... 6)  never trust a "doctor" who earned his degree at a mini-mall
