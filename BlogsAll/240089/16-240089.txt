friday night i had a wonderful dream: i was in some sort of sporting goods store, and i saw the two snowboards that i have always wanted (which is weird because the only board that i explicitly wanted before was the ride mountain and no other) and each of those boards were on sale.  the only problem i had was deciding which one to buy.  on the one hand, there was the ride mountain that i knew was perfect for me but it was last year's model.  the other board, whose details are hazy as of this moment, was a '02 model and also perfect for me... i then decided to buy the ride since it happened to fold into an umbrella as well, which was a nice extra function plus it made it a whole lot easier to carry.  that's when i woke up.  then about an hour or so later, chris calls me up and asks if i want to go to a snowboard carnival in newport that was also going to have some killer sales (not to mention the nice mixture of snowboard chicks and newport beach chicks).  now i'm thinking, god must really want me to buy a board this weekend.  and who am i to doubt god?  so now i'm in my apartment, looking at my 162 burton canyon (it's basically the burton custom but longer and wider, just not as wide as the floater) and drooling and laughing maniacally.  now i just have to wait for it to get colder and then for the snow to drop (or be made)... oh yea, chris bought himself a new floater as well, but this time he got one about 6cm longer (164 vs. the old 158) so he's going to go faster.  which is fine because i know my board is going to be sick-ass fast and, with this large sidecut, ultra manueverable
