i forgot to mention that when i was in vegas (in the paris hotel to be exact), i got my ass pinched.  i was standing by a $25 minimum blackjack table with my dad, my uncle, and my sister's boyfriend kyle, and we were waiting for my mom and my sister to get out of the restroom.  so i was watching the table when i felt a pinch on my ass, right next to my wallet, and once i felt it, i jerked my head around and i saw an attractive older lady (i say she was 30 or so) take off really quick and go into the bathroom.  i then tell everyone that my ass was just grabbed, and my dad gets suspicious and says that she was probably going for my wallet... luckily i was wearing my cargo shorts with the velcro pockets.  but then about 5 minutes later, she comes out of the restroom all smiles and trying to contain her laughter, walks right past us to the nearby bar, where she meets up with her friends and they all start laughing... so i guess she was put up to it.  this then leads me to two different conclusions (both involving a large intake of alcohol): (1) she saw me, remarked to her friends how attractive i was, and her friends then dared her to pinch my ass; (2) she saw me, remarked to her friends how  unattractive  i was, and her friends then dared her to pinch my ass. oh god i hope it was the former...
