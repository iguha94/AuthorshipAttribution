it's the first day of school for me and today all i had was my anatomy class that is carrying over from last quarter, so nothing new today.  except that some girl that i've never seen before walked into the biomed room 10 minutes before class, and since i was the only one there, she started to make small talk with me.  the only problem is that she was definitely in the wrong class (considering our midterm is monday), but she asked me, "you got the books already?" "yep" "when'd you get 'em?" "i've had them..." (since september, when school started... and i said it in a tone of voice that equated to "hey dumbass, you're in the wrong class") "can i look at 'em?" "uh..." at which point i was hoping that she would glance at my open books and see that they weren't for the class she intended to go to, or that my "uh..." meant that no, she couldn't look at them.  but apparently neither one of these came true.  i guess she figures that my response meant she can just go ahead and pick up my books while i'm studying them.  but after seeing that they are entitled  Human Gross Anatomy  and  Atlas of Human Anatomy , she must've figured that i was looking at them for another class.  at this point i think she could notice my disdain since she introduced herself right then, hoping that if know her name (it's annette by the way) it'd make it ok for her to just pick up my books.  now if she was hot then i wouldn't mind her bothering me and i probably would've personally guided her to her appropriate class, but since that wasn't the case, i figured my curt attitude was sufficient... stupid undergrads... haha anyways, i've been home from class for the past 2.5 hours and i really need to get studying, so i'll leave you with what i've been calling my winter break:  short and unproductive.
