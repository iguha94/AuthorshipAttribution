i was talking with one of my married classmates today, and i don't think i could be married and in med school at the same time.  it'd be just too hard.  but i think part of that is that i'm still only 23 and i can't imagine being married at this age regardless... i still feel too much like a kid.  but what i think is really weird is that my roommate is contemplating what he should do with his girlfriend.  they've been together for almost 3 years, and she wants to get married.  he wouldn't mind marrying her either, but he'd like to finish med school first.  and while i understand his predicament, i can't help but think i wish i had this problem.  i wish i had someone that i cared for so much that i would want to spend the rest of my life with...  i mean, i'm a shy guy and so i've never been one to have loads of chicks around me but with my crappy schedule, i have no real opportunities to meet any girls.  part of this is due to the fact that this portion of school is crazy hectic, but part of it is i don't really know where to meet any girls.  i guess i'll just have to wait until surgery is done and i can actually go out.  and i realize that i was in a committed relationship and then abandoned ship, but that relationship was destined to fail she wasn't what i wanted in a girl.  she was more of the right-now girl as opposed to the right girl... anyhow, i'm gonna go get some thai food.
