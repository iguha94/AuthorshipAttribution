i'm not a hairy man by any means... i didn't have to start shaving regularly until a couple of years ago, and even then it was once a week.  within the past year and a half or so, i've upped it to twice a week, but that's more of the optimist in me than the amount of facial hair i have.  but seeing patients and having to look professional makes me maintain this twice a week mantra of shaving.  it's not like anyone can tell when i need a shave (unless they touch my face)... my facial hair is golden or orangish with the occasional darker hair thrown in; so it's practically invisible.  that being said, the longest i've ever gone with shaving (since i started to shave) is about three weeks.  my roommate pete said i started to look a little scraggily, but i felt more like a hamster with mange than anything... it's also hard to believe him considering he's egyptian.  he accidently shaved his goatee uneven one day so he sheared it all off... within a week it was back like normal (don't forget those pictures of saddam... he grew a full beard in 8 months!!).  anyhow, being on anesthesia last week, i didn't give a shit how i looked and i figured with just this week between me and a glorious 2 weeks of vacation, i won't shave again until i start my next rotation in january.  however, knowing the facial hair on my cheeks is in an irregular pattern, i figured i'll try just growing that patch of hair on my chin.  it looks alright up close, but you can really see how sparse my facial hair is.  and it's not like anyone can tell from afar... it kinda looks like my chin is a bit dusty.  so i'll be test-driving this lone patch of hair on my face for the next couple weeks, but it itches like hell and makes me feel like a dumbass so i don't know how long before i shave it off.  not like anyone will notice either way...
