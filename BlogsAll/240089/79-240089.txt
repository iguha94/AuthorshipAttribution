so i'm in the midst of my plastic surgery rotation and i'm enjoying it, but i've come to the realization that i am no surgeon.  i'd rather stand by and watch than be scrubbed in and retract.  i don't feel too compelled to get in there and prep the patient for surgery.  i don't care if i put the foley catheter in, i don't care who scrubs the patient, and i don't care what's going on unless it's a crazy case with weird anatomy.  sure, i enjoy the time in there because that means that i'm not wasting time in the library or trying to take some patient's history in clinic (the reason i hate clinic so much is that even after i get the history from the patient and present to the resident or attending, they inevitably ask the patient the same questions that i did... so it makes you wonder why the hell i even bothered to see the patient in the first place).  but the spending time in the OR is draining and i dread going there. i know you're thinking, "wasn't this fool bitching only a couple weeks ago how he didn't get to go to the OR?" yes, yes i was.  but that was at a time when i had absolutely no OR time.  so i enjoy the OR, but in small doses and only then if i get to do something.  so i think i'm heading back towards the land of pathology.  but i dunno, i think i'll change my preceptor for next semester and then go from there...
