i'm sure you've heard of the adage, "beer before liquor, you've never been sicker... liquor before beer, you're in the clear." well, apparently there's a physiologic cause to that saying. alcohol is an inhibitor of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, and ADH normally promotes water reabsorption in the collecting duct of the nephron (i.e. the kidney).  so under conditions of dehydration, ADH secretion is high thus making you urinate concentrated (i.e. yellow) urine, because you want to conserve as much water as possible.  however, under conditions of excess fluid intake, ADH secretion is inhibited and you urinate dilute (i.e. clear) urine.  therefore, since alcohol inhibits ADH release, your kidneys essentially work like a pipe and dump out whatever they filter.  now this is where the opening statement comes in.  while a shot of hard liquor and beer each have the same amount of alcohol, their concentrations of alcohol differ markedly.  and since very few people can drink a beer in the same amount of time they can drink a shot (the only person i can think of is the Fox from the first season of the man show, but he died of pancreatic cancer), the amount of alcohol that you consume in one swig of a beer will be less than the shot of liquor.  well, this large, rapid infusion of alcohol then suppresses the ADH secretion, and you can then drink [almost] as much beer as you want... because you end up just peeing it all out (minus what gets metabolized).  however, when you drink a beer, it takes longer to suppress ADH release, causing you to retain the alcohol longer thus increasing the chance that you're gonna get sick.
