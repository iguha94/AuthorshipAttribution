yea so i had a freaky ass dream last nite and it involved a lot of people i know, just not any of the people that i really hang out with... it began as like this really crappy party that more resembled a slumber party than anything else, and at the party was jon berwanger, a kristy burwell/valerie cleland hybrid, a guy from my biomed classes who's normally a really cool guy, and a lot of other people that were relatively insignificant to the dream and seemed more like space fillers.  well anyways, jon berwanger really wasn't jon berwanger and instead reminded me more of phil lyle (why i'm dreaming about them i have no idea, but i think i dreamt about phil because he fits the "asshole" profile...) and he was being a complete asshole so i started to argue with him.  he started calling me names and was basically saying that i was a major asshole, and i agreed with him because, well, i can be.  but then i added that although i may be an asshole, that at least people still liked me.  at that he scoffed, and krislerie (the kristy/valerie hybrid) told me that nobody likes me and that people were just being polite.  i then started to argue with her over that when the guy from biomed told me that she was right and that the only people who really like me are kindergartners because they don't know any better.  he then added that the only reason i got invited to this party was that no one was going to come and that they just wanted to have some people there, even if that group of people included me... so i was incredibly hurt by that and then i woke up feeling like shit...
