apparently i haven't been sleeping all that soundly because i had another crazy ass dream.  this one was about my family and i being at a slide park (essentially a water slide park, but without the water) and for some strange reason we were with curt schilling (the arizona diamondback's pitcher).  well, the whole group divided up into pairs and we all went onto different sections of the park.  it just so happens i paired up with curt schilling, and he wanted to go down this slide that looked like another slide crossed just in front of the end of this slide, and the only way to avoid hitting this other slide was to stop early.  well anyways, i go down this slide and after recognizing this design problem, stopped quickly at the end and climbed around it.  so i then go wait in this bar (that happens to be right by the end of the slide i just went on) and i watch curt schilling slide down.  well i guess he didn't see the design flaw of the slides and smacks right into the other slide... he then goes flying into the air a la "meet joe black" and gets seriously hurt.  then this hot blond chick next to me at the bar starts screaming and i go help curt get up and make sure he's alright.  then once he's up, i'm checking him for broken bones when i hear this beeping sound.  i'm thinking it's someone cell phone but then i realize it's my alarm clock, so i wake up...
