i was feeling pretty good about this weekend cuz after i went to the beach thursday, i came home to find that i had received my financial aid check.  the following day i spent the day with my family celebrating the 4th at the los alamitos reserve base.  me and the boys then went out to buena park where we made safe and sane fireworks more fun.  after getting kicked out by the buena park pd, i went home and finally fell asleep around 1am.  at 4:30, my parents' phone rang... it was my mom.  you see, she had taken my car to work because the van was still full of crap from the 4th, and she didn't have much time to clean it out before she had to leave for work at 4am.  apparently, while she was cruising down the 105, some guy in an suv didn't see her, cut in front of her, and then slammed on the brakes.  she slammed on the brakes but still hit the driver and got pushed from the fastlane into the center divider's emergency lane.  the guy then proceeded to drive off (we think he had either stolen the car or had been drunk)... so in the end, my mom's arm is hurt, my car was totaled, and i'm fucked since i have class monday morning...  or at least i was, until my dad called his brother-in-law to see if he knew anyone that had an extra car.  it turns out his mom has a 93 plymouth acclaim that she has as a backup car... so we bought that for 800 and now i have a new car...
