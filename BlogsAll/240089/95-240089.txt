my day was already pretty crappy as i was getting to my car at 5pm, but god had more in store for me.  as i was trying to leave the parking structure, my car's engine completely shut off and i simply coasted to the next available parking spot.  after trying to start my car for the next 10 minutes, i called my parents.  my dad was at work and i couldn't get ahold of him, so i called my mom and she had me speak with my uncle.  but as he tried to ask me questions about the car, with the fact that i know nothing about cars and the fact that the only good place to get reception in the parking structure was 40 feet from my car, my mom and my uncle drove up to westwood to see if he could fix the car right then and there... as my luck would have it, of course not.  so we pushed my car out of the parking structure and waited 45 minutes for the tow truck.  we decided to just leave the car at my apartment and tow it ourselves (using kyle's truck and a trailer from uhaul) later.  this isn't as horrible as one might think because my psych rotation is at ucla and i can take the bus, plus with spring break happening over the next two weeks, i have plenty of time to get it fixed... hopefully this will provide the impetus for my parents to stop breaking those promises of getting me a new(er) car... all i know is that mexico is looking better and better by the day...
