well it seems like i just keep on winning.  today, i received a letter from the dreyer's ice cream corporation that stated that i had won a prize in their most recent sweepstakes.  my prize? a $1 off coupon for a 48oz. container of ice cream... i wonder if i have to report this on my income tax. haha anyways, i was going to post the following yesterday, but blogger was down partially... by that i mean i could post blogs, only they wouldn't be published.  oh well... the seven things that are important to my education (in no particular order): 1) watching tv 2) napping 3) reading the comics 4) alcohol 5) snowboarding 6) blogging/chatting 7) girls and i guess you could add studying to that list, but then it makes my life sound too nerdy... haha one last thing, as i watched the MTV europe music awards (from which i learned that europeans are stupid and weird. but european-americans are different and aren't idiots... for the most part anyways), there was a category for best male video with a whole bunch of people in it that are very popular here in the states (but whose names escape me at the moment) and also robbie williams.  well, robbie williams won and his speech was absolutely hilarious.  here's the gist of it: "last year when i won this award i was very arrogant and said thanks to all the fans for my three houses, my five cars, and my wealth.  well, this past year was tough and i had to sell two of the houses, as well as all of my cars, and you know, us celebrities have many divorces which are quite expensive, so please, go out and buy my album..." needless to say, chris and i busted up laughing...
