ok so i haven't been blogging all that much but that's because this past week and a half have been pretty hectic.  on last monday i basically woke up late and then studied all night, only to study again all night on tuesday for my anatomy final that was wednesday morning.  normally i would've spent the next couple of days goofing off, but right after the final i went to the library and studied for my immuno quiz that i had the next day... well, after that crapfest on thursday, i did nothing all weekend... and it was everything i thought it could be.  but come monday i was back at it studying for my immuno midterm that i had today... and lemme just say that the professor is a liar.  we were told that the midterm was going to be multiple choice, fill in the blank, and free response.  instead, we got 6 free response... that bastard!  and i know what you're thinking, why the hell did i have a quiz on thursday only to have a midterm on today?  well, it was either that or have the quiz right before my anatomy final, and the whole biomed class wasn't gonna have any of that... so now i'm just going to goof off until thursday night, when i'll study for my microbiology quiz on friday. (micro started once anatomy ended... so no more cadavers for me, unless i have to repeat this year)
