I didn't mention it last night, but I did get a job yesterday, sort of.  I got hired by a staffing place, sort of a temp agency.  They call me up and say "we've got someone who needs someone to do this for this many days, for this much pay."  And if I want it, I take it.  And if it's a long term position, after I work at a place for 90 days, the place can hire me if they want, and I'll actually work for them, instead of for the temp agency.  Today they called me with an offer, but I didn't take it, it paid too little for too hard work.  It was a warehouse job for Atwoods, a local farm store.  It was loading and unloading trucks for ten hours a day for only $7.00 an hour.  So I told them I didn't want that job, so they'll call me when they get another opening.  I'm at my parent's house right now, getting online on their phone line, since I can't get online much at my place.  My mom's been having to go to the doctor a lot lately, she was having really bad pains in her back/stomach a couple of weeks ago.  They did x-rays and then cat-scans and still couldn't figure out what was wrong with her.  They think they've finally figured out what's wrong with her maybe, but they won't tell her, they're sending her to a specialist, and they're going to tell her there.  So my mom figures it's Ovarian Cancer.  All they'll tell her is that they did find something possibly wrong with her ovaries, and that they need to get her to the specialist as soon as possible.  Man, life just keeps getting worse.
