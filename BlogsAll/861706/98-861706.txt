Cool!  I'd heard about this email scam before from a couple of places, and they all acted like everyone had seen it, but this is the first time I've ever gotten it.  I feel special now.  Hey, it's the most exciting thing to happen to me in quite some time...which is really fucking sad.  I don't say this very often, but I really need to get laid...  Anyway, here's the email thing I was talking about.   URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL _______________________   I am Mrs. Mariam. Abacha, the widow of Sani Abacha the Late Nigerian Head of State.  I am presently in distress and under house arrest while my son Mohammed is undergoing trial in Lagos and Abuja though he has just been recently granted bail under the condition that my family refunds to the Federal Government some amount of money. The government has frozen all the family account and auctioned all our properties.  Refer to this website about my husband's loot and you will understand what I mean  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1935646.stm  To save the family from total bankruptcy I have managed to ship through an undercover courier company, the sum of US24, 000,000.00. kept by my late husband.
