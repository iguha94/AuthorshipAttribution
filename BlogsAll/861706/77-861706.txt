Dammit.  I'm starting to think I shouldn't have posted that junk-email complaint.  Since then I've been getting two or three times the amount I usually got, and I got a lot already.  I emptied my email last night at about 2:00 a.m., and then this morning, barely 8 hours later, I had 32 new emails, all but one was junk.   About ten of them were penis enlargement offers.  I hate those things.  I also got an email about mortgage rates from someone with the email address of "AssBaller69."  Why would anyone want to get money advice from anyone with that name?  I also got an email from someone named "NxemaGirll."  Noxema Girl?  What the hell?  Yes!  I found a web page that shows/explains lots of different Japanese smileys.  Japanese smileys are the ones you see sometimes that you don't read sideways, like American smileys, i.e. :-) Japanese smileys are like this, (^ - ^)  That is a smile/happy emoticon, the mouth may not look like a smile, but you have to go by the eyes.  Here are some more: (^ _ ^)    Smile/Happy. (*^ _ ^*)    Smile and blushing. (>_ (-_-)zzz   Sleeping. (T _ T)    Crying (Tears are running down the face like in Japanese Anime/Manga) (o_o?)    What?  When you are confused, don't understand, or are just pretending ignorance. (^ _ ^)V    Victory!  Making the "V for Victory" sign. (-_-)        Getting angry inwardly.  Angry but not really showing it. (^ ^)//    Happy, applauding. (^ _ ^;)    Surprised, embarrased, amazed.  Cold sweat drop on the head like in Anime/Manga. (o_o  )(  o_o)    Looking around, looking for something. (@_@)    Dizzy/Giddy. (- . -)y-~~    Smoking a cigarette. (^_-)-*    Wink. (^ . ^)/    Waving. (; . ;)/    Waving goodbye and crying. (=^ . ^=)    Cat.   This can also be combined with some of the others to get cat moods. ~~~~(m--)m    Flying ghost/spirit/demon.  I like this one.   Here's the links to the pages that I got these from.    Here's  a small sample of the most popular ones.  And   Here  is a more complete long list.  I could've just done that in the beginning and saved a lot of time and space, but I didn't want to.  It's my blog, I can do what I want.  (>_
