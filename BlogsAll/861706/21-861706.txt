From the "Those Wacky Japanese" file:  Japanese car manufacturers often give their show cars English- style names.  Here are a few names used on actual show cars exhibited in Japan, as reported by Jean Lindamood in Automobile Magazine:       Nissan Big Thumb      Nissan Leopard J Ferie      Nissan Fairlady Z      Mazda Bongo Brawny      Mazda Proceed Marvie Wild Breeze      Mazda Familia Interplay      Mazda Autozam Carol Melady      Toyota Hiace One Day Trip      Toyota Land Cruiser 80 Active Vacation      Toyota Estima Lucida G Luxury Joyful Canopy      Mitsubishi Pajero Field Guard      Mitsubishi Delica Green Field      Mitsubishi Mirage Cyborg R      Mitsubishi Debonair Exceed      Mitsubishi MUM 500 Shall we join us?

I've done a lot of work to it the last few days, but you can't really tell, because most of what I did was just changing the code from old style HTML to XHTML and CSS, so it looks pretty much the same, but the code behind it is completely different.  I did add some CSS features to make it look nice, and I've added a whole lot more links.  There's almost 100 links now, most notably, the Anti-Scientology section.  So   click here  now!  You bastards, and she-bastards.
