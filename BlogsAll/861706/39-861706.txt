Cough, hack, wheeze, hack, cough up blood.  I'm sick, very sick.  It sucks.  That's why I am am writing this right now, instead of being at work or at Chris' house.  I called in sick today.  I've been sick for a few days now.  It started out as sniffles and sinus problems and sometimes itchy eyes.  Almost seemed like allergies.  I think allergies is part of it though, everytime I go to Chris' house I get sicker, and he gets sick while he's there too.  But if we leave we get better (I did at first, but now I'm sick full-time).  We have no idea what could be causing it though, maybe it's that deadly house mold or something.  Anyway, it started out as a really sore throat, and then sinus problems, but then, yesterday, it moved into my chest, and I developed chest congestion and a horrible cough.  By the end of the night last night, I felt almost dead I was so weak from coughing so hard all night.  I felt so bad I probably wouldn't have been able to sleep if I hadn't been so weak and drugged up on various medicines.  It's still mainly my chest today, with a bad cough, not as bad as yesterday though, and a slight bit of sinus congestion.  It really sucks.  I haven't coughed up blood yet, but everytime I cough, it hurts so bad I expect to.
