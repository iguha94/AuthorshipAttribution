Unfortunately this society has deified their gender boundaries, especially the rules of what boys should and should not like or do, and have made them into gods."  And, if seeing pictures of this guy dressed as Peter Pan isn't enough to make you wish you were blind, he's also got a gallery of himself dressed as a Christmas Elf.
