Now that I have had time to think, and process all my  son has told me, here we go...  He is 14, and THINKS he is ready to face life full force.  HE knows to say no to drugs, smoking, alcohol,and even says he plans on being a virgin when he marries, because he is scared of STD's.  Those things are all good.  But he thinks he is ready to be in situations where he will be  forced to make spur of the moment decisions regarding these things.    I disagree.    This is a boy, in a 5'11" 250lb body, who is scared to walk to his grandparents house (less than a football field away) after dark.  Same boy still brings his blankets and pillows after we go to sleep and makes a pallet outside our bedroom door to sleep.   Sure, he is ready to be confronted with sex, drugs and all those   other things that can mess you up if you do them too young.  Sure.    I know he has saw these things, up close, but in a restricted, "safe" place like school.  (before we started homeschooling)  Not on a one on one basis, with friends, at a party, or at the mall, or wherever.    Yes , we have equipped him with the knowledge to make good decisions. I'm just not sure he has the wisdom to use the knowledge.  it is our job to make sure he has both, wisdom and knowledge.    What he doesn't realize is that his dad and I have the same morals.  We agree o his restrictions.  I just come out being the bad guy, because, I am mom.  my oldest has reached that age, the age when to him, mom has no clues what it is like to be him.  No, I don't know what it is like to be a teenage boy, but I do know what it is like to be a teenage girl.
