         The table was cold.  She hated cold tables.  Seems like she had spent most of her life on them.  Why does everything involve a cold table?  Or is it just her.  Maybe she was cold.   Nothing good ever comes from a cold table, especially ones like this one.  Metal, rectangular, with only a paper sheet over it.  Of course it had those mandantory feet holders at the bottom, they are metal too.  More coldness.   She couldn't tell their was a cushion on top of the table, all she could feel was the cold.  When the door opened, the breeze moved the paper sheet laying over her.   "Well, how are you today Jazz?"  Doc Riley half heartedly asked, " I didn't expect to see you for awhile. Thought for sure it worked this time."   "I know doc, I thought it did to, this is the last time, I can't do this anymore." Jazz said quietly, while Doc helped her get her feet in the stirrups.  " Coop doesn't know I came back, he didn't want to put me thru it all again"   Doc Riley went thru the motions, they had all been here before, She really wanted this time to work. In all her years of practice, she had never rooted for a couple as much as Cooper and Jasmine Brande.  Jasmine was willing to put her body thru anything and everything to have a child.  Just one.  She didn't care what sex it was, or even if it was healthy, she just wanted a child to hold, and to say, this is my blood.  And Cooper was willing to go thru hell and high water to give his love what her hearts desire.   As Jazz sat up, "you know the drill, same as the last 5 times"  Doc Riley told her.  "I'll give you a call tomorrow to check on you.  Tell Coop to fix his famous chicken for you for supper tonight.  you deserve it."  Once home, Jazz lay in her bed thinking.  Had she done the right thing going behind Coop's back against his wishes and having the procedure done one last time?  She knewhe would be fuming inside when she told him, but she also knew he wanted a child as much as she does.  She wasnt' scared, just nervous.  It broke his heart every time only one pink line came up.  He mourned the loss as much as she did.  Sometimes she thought it was stupid to mourn the loss of a child that never existed in the first place.  That was something to come to terms with later.  Now, she would only thing happy thoughts.   "hey baby, where are you"  coop yelled thru the house, it wasnt' like Jazz to not be at the door when he came in from work.  She always beat him home.  She drove like a maniac, no matter where she was, she would always beat him home.   He had a suprise for her today, knowing how crushed she had been the last procedure didn't work, he decided they needed to get away, just for the weekend.  So he booked them a room at this ancient bed and breakfast in Charleston.  Jazz had always wanted to see historic Charleston.  he would indulge her this weekend, and then maybe approach her about adoption.    What's up babe, why are you in bed?"  Coop asked, " rough day at work?  I sure had one, one of my best clients called, mad as hell, seems like Sherr---, "hon, what's wrong"   "I went to doc Riley today, I know you didn't want me to, but this is the last time, I promise.  I will stay just like this for as long as I have to, I won't get out of bed, even to pee, or shower, I won't move.  Just please, Coop, don't be angry"  Jazz pleaded with him, "I had to give it one last try, tell me you understand, please"  "Shit babe, what did you go alone for, you know I would have went with you, even if it does piss me off you did it behind my back, you shouldn't have went alone.   What if something had happened, Huh"  Coop was so tired of this.  So fed up with all the baby talk, everything was about having a baby with Jazz.  everything.  She was obsessed.  But then, that's how she was about everything.   When they met, it was thanks to one of Jazz's obsessions.  She was searching for the ultimate bike.  He was working in a sporting goods store to help pay is way thru Duke university, and this girl came in every day for three weeks.  Looking at all the bikes, trying them out, asking questions of all the sales associates.  They had decided she was a nut case.  Finally Coop was the only one who would approach her, and answer her questions.   They finally decided on a bike, and she asked he could put it in her car for her.  After he did, she offered to buy him a latte to thank him.  He told her he would rather she let him buy her dinner.  That was it.  The crazy "bike babe" as his co-workers called her, was under his skin.  One dinner is all it took.   That was 5 years ago.  They had spent 4.5 of those years as man and wife.  Once they finally admitted thier feelings to one another, they saw no reason to court, be engaged, or all the other stuff society says you have to do.  So, they went to the court house, got a license, and then went downstairs to the magistrate and had him do the ceremony.  Simple.   He knew this baby thing wasn't going to pass.  The docs had told them 2 years ago, that despite the surgeries, treatments, hormones, and countless pills, Jazz just wasn't able to get pregnant.  They really didn't know why.  They couldn't find a medical reason for it.  Everything was intact, all her labs were perfect.  She just couldn't get pregnant.  He had been poked and prodded more than any man would normally allow, and all his labs were fine.  So no problem there.   The fertility gods were against them.   All this was going thru his head while he cooked supper.  Chicken.  Jazz's favorite.  He had learned to cook when he was a teenager.  His mom insisted he know how to cook, she wasn't letting him leave the house, to marry some woman and have her wait on him hand and foot.  His mom did not believe in men coming home from work and parking their butts in a chair while the wife did all the work.  She raised her boys to know as much about housework and cooking as her girls did.     Coop didn't think he could do this again.  Every time was the same.  Every time they would wait the 10 days, and then test.  Each morning after, getting their hopes up for that pink line to show that never did.  For 6 weeks this would go on.  until Doc Riley would finally tell Jazz it was over.  She wasn't pregnant.    One more time, that's it, one more time.  He kept repeating over and over in his head.  Just one more time.    Jazz had stayed in bed literally for two weeks.  She knew Coop was disappointed, and frankly, she was too. That Charleston trip would have been a dream.  To walk the historic streets, tour the plantation houses, she had always wanted to go.  But it would wait.   She had other things to do first.  Instead of watching the clock, she was getting ready for work.  Trying to figure out why exactly having a child of her own was so important.  Why she couldn't even entertain the thought of adoption.  There must be a reason.  She just had to figure it out.  Jasmine was the youngest of her family.  5 kids, she was not only the baby girl, but the baby all together.  Not a bad spot to be in.  Except in her family.  All the older kids were old enough to be her parents.  They grew up together in the same house at a time when their parents were young and had energy to play, and patience to put up with a child.   Not that growing up in her house was bad.  She was very thankful she landed with the family she got.  Her family had adopted her when she was just an infant.  Her life could have been much much worse, and she knew that.  But still, she didn't have a single memory of them playing in the yard with her, no memory of trips to the park, no little league, no girl scouts.  Sleepovers were never allowed, her parents needed the sleep, and they couldn't tolerate the giggling six 12 year olds would put them through.   Jazz always knew she was loved.  By her parents that is.  To her older bothers and sisters, she was a nuiscince.  She was the reason her parents wouldn't babysit, or go on vacations iwth them in the middle of a school year.  She took her parents retirement from them.  She was a whole new family from them, and they didn't car if they ever included her in their clique.   Mainly, she was just ignored by them.   Unless she was doing something bad.  They always saw when she screwed up.  Always, and they made sure she knew about it too.  When she threw a rock across the street and hit a car driving by, they made sure mom knew and punished her for it.   But all in all, her childhood was a good one.  She was the apple of her parents eye.  Her adoptive ones at least.  Her birth mother had chosen to give her up for adoption so she could still live iwth her parents.  Rejection as an infant.  Jazz didn't even know who her biological father was.  Who knows, he could have been her high school gym teacher.  She had no idea.  None.  And never would.  Why put herself thru another rejection.  HE rejected her when he found out she was being born, so why would he want her now?  That's why having a child of her own was so important to Jazz.  She wanted to look into soemones eye's and see herself.  To see a smirk and know it came from her.  She wanted to walk down the street with her child and have strangers comment on how much the child looked like her.  She wanted to be able to know beyond a shadow of a doubt there was a body out there with the same blood as her in it.  She wanted a child to show how much she could love.  She wanted to let her child know how revered it was.  To know what it was like to feel part of something bigger than life.  To know what family felt like.   Coop could never understand that.  He grew up with brothers and sisters that looked like him, parents that loved him from the second he was concieved.  He played little league, there were baby pictures of him, his parents had taken him to the local pool to swim, taught him how to swim in it.  No his life wasn't without heartache, but he had always known his family.  Jazz never would.  Not until she gave birth to her family.   That was it, she would never feel liek she had her own family until she had a child.   "Jazz, JAZZ LOOK AT ME" startled, she realized Coop was shaking her arm, "sorry hon, I was in la-la land again. Deep thought.  What is it?" looking at her watch she hustled by Coop to put her shoes on, she was late for work.  Rushing around, she noticed Coop hadn't moved from his spot in the bathroom, he was just frozen in one spot.  Not moving, not speaking.  Just froze.  "COOPER BRANDE, what is wrong with you, we are going to be late for work, get a move on..."  Jazz screamed at him.  Now who was off in la-la land she thought.   "Screw work"  Coop finally said.  "we're staying home"  He whispered as he walked across the room to Jazz, taking her in his arms, he barely managed to get out the words "mom, you are staying home for good."  In his hand, he held the white stick, Jazz had forgotten about it.  But wouldn't forget it again, ever, for that stick had not just one, but two pink lines.                                                       THE END             </post>
