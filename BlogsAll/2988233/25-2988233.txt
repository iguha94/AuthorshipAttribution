Wow, my first blog entry!  Whoohoo, does this mean I am finally with it?    WHy do a blog?  Well let's see, as the mom of 5 kids, a written journal just doesn't fit, I mean come on, the boys would find it, read it, show it to their dad, rip it to shreds, spill juice on it, let the dog eat it...you get the picture, this is much more feasible.   I am trying really hard to straighten out some messed I got myself into.  i have been fighting depression for over 6months now, and my meds aren't working well.  When I am depressed, I spend money.  Then I get depressed all over again because I spent too much money, and can't pay the bills.  This vicious cycle has been going on for a while now.    I finally sat Tommy down Sunday and explained it all to him.  Let's just say he wasnt' pleased.  SO now, I am trying to earn back his trust.  It is going to take a long, long, long long time.  All the bills are behind, I bounced checks, got credit cards behind his back.  What was I thinking?  I have no idea.  I mean honestly, I have no idea what was going thru my head all this time.    So now, I am trying to fight the depression even harder, gave all the money, check book, everything over to Tommy, and he is taking care of bills now.  In a way, it was a relief, but I hate that I couldn't handle it.  It jsut makes me seem like such a failure to him.    I really don't do most of the wife things well anyhow.  Mom things, I am great at, but    wife things, not.  I hate to clean house, hate doing laundry, love to cook though, but I get distracted and burn stuff easily.  So , I am really buckling down on myself to do better.  I have to, my marriage is at stake here.
