While having our quiet time the other night, I mentioned to Tommy that I had heard from the local high school that day.  This confused my husband, I have forgotten to tell him I had called to ask about Driver's ed classed for our oldest.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had also failed to realize we would have a freshman in high school in 2 weeks if he were in public school.&nbsp;   Freshman.  Me, Tommy, parents of a high schooler.&nbsp; I for one know I am NOT old enough to have a high school kid.&nbsp; I know this hit Tommy pretty hard.&nbsp; Why, because he kept repeating, "high schooler" over and over.&nbsp;   All other things aside, you know mid life crisis, keeping a marriage alive, dealing with aging parents.&nbsp; Nothing quite hits you in the gut like those words, "oh, our oldest starts high school this year"&nbsp; BAM!&nbsp; Right in the gut, all of the sudden the joints don't work like they used to.&nbsp; Staying up past midnight takes days to recover from.&nbsp; Playing football in the yard with the boys seems to inflict more injuries than normal, and not on the kids.&nbsp; Conversations seem to turn more towards adult topics, then you realize "wait, this is my SON saying this stuff".&nbsp; Where did the kids with the smile that went all over his face go to?&nbsp; And why did this kid with a perma-scowl replace him?  We are lucky, the public school system does have to let him enroll in driver's ed with them.&nbsp; Thank God.&nbsp; He will start sometime in the fall, or early winter.&nbsp; I am not ready for this.&nbsp;   &nbsp;
