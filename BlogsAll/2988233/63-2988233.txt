I found out who the jerk was, it was someone I know playing a joke on me.  But it did make me aware of how open I am on this thing.  So, I will me making changes.  The photo album is gone.  I took it down last night.    The whole thing last night really upset me, and frankly, It opend my eyes to alot of things.  I had never given  much thought to putting myself out there so much on this blog.  I haven't really restrained much.  This world is a perverted place, and I know that, I just didn't give any thought to those perverts finding my blog.  I knwo it was jsut a friend playig a game last night, but what is to stop it from happening in the future?    I have seen alot of blogs lately with comments asking people to link to their blogs, then when you check out their blog, it is a some sicko.  I don't want that stuff connected to me.    IF I change blogs, I will ahve to figure out some way to let those of you I have made friends with know where I am .  I have grown to like our little community!lol.   I need to clarify somethings about my niece I was writing about yesterday.  I have prayed and prayed about it, and while I wouldn't turn her away, I don't want her as my child, I want her out of the situation she is in.  No child should live like that.  I know to her, it is normal, but she is really in a messed up place.  I know too much stuff about her parents, grandparents and the tension that is there all the way around.  She needs to be out.  Away from all the dysfunction and in a place where she can be nurtured and grow into a healthy, happy well adjusted person.  Unless some major changes happen, that won't happen where she is.    Well, enough of my emotional rollercoaster.  I am ready to get off, and have a great day.  It is beautiful, and I am thinking of working in the yard today.  I don't do that often.  But today looks like a good day to start.
