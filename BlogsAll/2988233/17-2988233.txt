I am still trying to gather my thoughts.  It was the most amazing film I have ever seen.  Seriously.   I wound up going with just Tj and Casey, mom got sick and daddy wants to see it with her, so he stayed home.  The boys handled it well, they turned their heads when parts got too rough for them.  And during the whipping scene, I could hear both of them gasping with each strike.  It was definitly eye opening.    I bawled my eyes out the entire time.  From the moment Judas betrayed him, until he bowed his head and gave up the ghost.  It really struck home when they showed Mary when he fell with the cross, remembering in her mind when he was a child and fell, how she comforted him and made it all better, and now seeing him on the ground under the weight of his cross, all she wanted was to make it all better.  That killed me.  I could just see that as one of my sons.    Liek others ahve mentioned, I couldn't move from my seat when it was over.  I had to sit and take all I had seen in.  I was so angry at the pharisees, I wanted to see them physically pay for what they had done, I was furious.  And even though I knew the outcome, and why he did it, I still found myself whispering to the Father, to please let him go, let the torture stop, let him save himself.  For I know that I am not worth it.  I am not worthy of all he has given for me.  My price was to high.    If you haven't seen this movie, go, as soon as possible.  Go.
