It's friday again.  I spent all day long goign all over two counties paying bills.  But, at least I got them all done.    Tommy THINKS that if we keep using every dime he makes minus gas money, and 25 a week groceries, we can have every single bill caught up by the end of May.  While I am looking forward to being completely caught up, I'm not sure if I can keep going on 25 a week.  We ahve been depending heavily off my parents.  But, I do get food stamps this week, so I can stock up on food for a bout 2 weeks.  then it will be back to scrimping again .    I did splurge today and buy us lunch out.  We had been in the car all day long, going here and there, and were starved, so, I pulled thru the drive thru and fed us.  I t was so nice to sink my teeth into a juicy hamburger that someone else made.  lol.  One the way home from work, Tommy told me when this is all over HE is going out to eat.  THen he laughed and said notice I said just ME.  ha, ha.    My house is clean.  That is a huge statement considering the state of my mentality the past few weeks.  I tend to not clean when I am down.  BUt, me and the boys cleaned our you know what's off Thursday, and while I was gone today, the two oldest stayed home and basically just straightened.  It didnt' take much.  I mean even all my dishes are washed.  YOu can ask any one, that is a feat in itself.  I always have a pan or cookie sheet or something soaking, but not today, and not yesterday.   I washed them all, every single last peice.  I was so proud, now to only get my laundry caught up like that...
