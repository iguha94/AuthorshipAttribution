I do, I really do.  It is so depressing, and hard to watch.    On our local news this morning, a local high school has approved random drug testing for all students next year.  I am all for getting rid of drugs, but is this legal?  It seems like they would have to get written permission from the parents of the minors first, and then with all the confidentiality stuff,  they wouldn't be able to tell anyone about the results.  So why do it in the first place?  Then the people who are blaming Runsfeld for the stuff that the untrained soldiers did.  I don't agree with what was done to the prisoners,but why blame Rumsfeld, the blame goes to the ones who did it,and their supervising officers.  Do you realize how many levels of rank and red tape you have to go thru to get to Rumsfeld?  He has enough on his mind, don't start prosecuting him for something that is thousands of mile away from him.  Plus there is the fact that the Iraqis are doing much cruler stuff to our men that they have hostage. Between the killings, torture and beheadings, on video no less, these aren't nice people.  I know we are supposed to be "above" that.  But are Americans forgetting why we are doing this to begin with?  Has everyone forgotten 9/11?  Have they forgotten what a man Hussein was, how he tortured his own people? That if he had be left alone, he would have just kept finaincing terrorist groups, and reaking havoc on the good guys?   That is all of my political rant.     I'm not normally political, but you know what? I watched the news this morning.
