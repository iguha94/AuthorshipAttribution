1am, what am I doing up at 1 am, I'm not a college student, a teenager, I am a mom.  I have to get up with my hubby, I have kids to take care of, I can not stay up all night.  Tell that to my left ovary.  It isn't listening to me.  It is screaming at me like a baby when you take its bottle away.  Or as my 14 yr old just said, a banchee that just got kicked in the balls.  Huh?  Anyhow, I hurt, can't sleep, so of course, I am on here.  What else is there to do at 1am??????? That is legal and perfectly acceptable for a married woman who loves her hubby that is.  Just sent the 14 yr old back to bed.  He is such a night owl.    I know Tommy had other plans for keeping me up tonight, but my ovary is screaming.  It hasn't screamed like this in several months, not since I started on my meds for   PCOS.   At that time, I had co many cysts on my ovaries they couldn't even count them.  I would hate to see them now, with as bad as I hurt.    Tommy lost tonight to his boss at pool.  This was the first time in almost 6 weeks they have played each other.  This competition started 3 years ago.  TOmmy goes over to R's house every thursday night, and the play the best of 21 games.  They keep tally all year long, and crown the champion at he end of the year.  Tommy was last year's champ.  Them missing 6 weeks in a row is huge.  They haven't missed more than one week at a time the entire 3 years.  IF they can't make it on thursday, it gets rescheduled for another night.  They take this stuff seriously.  Even at work, you walk in on Friday morning, the first words out of everyone's mouth is "who won last night?"  Unbelievable.
