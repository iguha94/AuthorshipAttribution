Down to the wire, I was still stumped, didn't know who I wanted to win.  I still don't and Fantasia has already won!  They were both great contestants.  I still say Latoya should have won, and she proved it at the pre show, and during the idol performances tonight.  That girl can sing.  Plain and simple.  I was rooting for both Fantasia and Diana.  I felt Fantasia was the best of the two, BUT that She would get a record deal without the competition.  Diana, I think will do great, she will get a deal also.  So will Latoya and probably Jennifer Hudson.  The others I'm not to sure about.    I cried during most of the show.  I loved seeing Kelly Clarkson, She is my favorite Idol so far.  I can't help it, I love to hear her sing.    THen I turn the TV to CBS, just in time to hear Tim McGraw.  That is one sexy man.  I will leave it at that.    I also heard the "save a horse, ride a cowboy song" for the first time.  I laughed.    My spring cleaning spree is on.  I have thrown away so much stuff today.  I cleaned out my room, TJ's room and Casey's room.  Let me tell you, I threw everything that wasn't tied down away.  And I will be getting rid of lots more tomorrow.  Trust me.
