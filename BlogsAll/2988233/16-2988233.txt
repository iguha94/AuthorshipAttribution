It's funny, I was just over reading Renee's blog and noticed that we both chose these artsy, kind of beautiful gloomy templates. Is that an oxymoron? Hmmmmm.....  There are a lot of sirens going by on the highway, more than I have ever heard. Something big must be going on. It seems to be coming from about a mile away at this HUGE trailer park. I hope it isn't anything fatal.   I have two teeth that are killing me. I had read in a book from Ellen, (one of tommy's bosses) that pure peppermint oil is good for healing. A couple of weeks ago, Tommy started using it on his bad tooth, it no longer bothers him. So yesterday, I took the plunge and started using it. It is rather shocking that it works. I am not a "essential oil" kind of person. But this stuff works. I'll do anything to stay out of a dentist chair.   I am trying very very hard to get out of this funk. Today has not been a good day. Yes, I did get to see The Passion of the Christ, but other than that, I have been down, deep down, all day. I have had to fight all day to keep from just curling up in a ball in the bed with the lights out and the covers over my head. I actually did go to bed for about 3 hours this morning. But I have fought all day long to stay up. I am trying to last until 11pm. Then I will feel like it is ok to go to bed. I am just emotionally exhausted.   Renee asked me today to think about going to chapel hill with her. I would love to go. Absolutely love it. I feel like I need it too. But I'm not sure how Tommy will react. I'm going to pray about it, before talking to him. He of all people knows that Savannah brings me joy. No matter how down I am, all she has to do is say Haaayyyy when she walks in the door, and my spirits lift. She is just a little angel God has given us to brighten our days. Especially Aunt Gee's day.  I need to go to bed. I don't think I will make it to 11pm. Maybe I can just go lay down and watch TV until 11, and then sleep, would that count?
