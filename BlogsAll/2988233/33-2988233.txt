When I kept telling Tommy, "I want a baby" after each of our children turned a year old, why didn't someone smack me, tell me that those precious little bundles of joy would grow up to be smart mouthed, moody, bigger than their mama teenagers one day????????  Huh, tell me, why didn't I get smacked??????  TJ, my first born, the love of my life, the one who made me want more and more just like him, woke up mad at the world today.  These days, that is normal.  I asked him at some point this morning, to make his bed.  30 seconds later, he is in the office, "why are you so mad at me?" "why do you keep yelling at me????" I am at a total loss for words, which is a pretty amazing feat in itself.  So, basically I jsut told him he needed to go to another room, we were not having thathat conversation.  OF course, by lunch time, he had apologized.  After replaying the morning back in his head, he saw he was WAAAYYYYYY out of line.   Casey is well on the moody trail himself.  He refused to come back from my parents house with TJ today, he was mad at me for making him do his chores.  This is his normal, daily chore, that he knows each and every day he has to do.  But today, me reminding him to do it, jsut was what pushed him right over the edge.  Oh well, he came home about an hour later, all happy and friendly again.  I'm telling you, girls, be glad you have PMS, this stuff the boys go thru, just doesn't stop, it is one huge flight up the elevator of testosterone that doesn't come back down until they are 20!!!!  You know, when TJ first hit puberty, his pedatrician, a female, mom of 4 kids herself, told me that when her son was 14, she told him to his face "Son, if I could sell you, I would."  I now see her point.
