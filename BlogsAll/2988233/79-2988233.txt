I did something that is very rare among mom's today.  I went shopping, without the kids, and didn't buy them anything!  Gasp, horror, I know,  HOW COULD I DO THAT??????  I will probably be kicked out of Moms club of America now, but hey, it was fun.  I loved it.  I was pure blissfullness, walking around   Walmart , with no kids fussing, I didn't have to get down on all fours, looking under clothes to see where my precious ones are hiding.  When I got to the checkout, I didn't have to rummage thru the buggy to see what "extras" I had picked up without knowing.    TO my amazement, those screaming and moans I am used to hearing upon entering the   lingerie department , aren't provided by Walmart, those were actually coming from my boys.  Seems as if boys don't like it when "mom" shops for lingerie.  Hmmmmm, I wonder why.  I got to slowly, feel all the shirts, which ones were soft, which ones were pure starch, and which ones were just plain ol itchy.  I wandered thru housewares, and imagined my bathroom in all the different ensembles.  Did I want a pink, girly bathroom, or did I want  a gender neutral one?    I longed wistfully at the 2 piece bathing suits that will never, ever, appear on my body.  Wondering if there is a mom only beach somewhere that the pre-requisite is that you still have on at least 50 lbs of baby fat before you can enter.    Oh, and lets not forget the   Sterilite  dept.  All those storage totes, bins, racks, do-dad holders, you name it, it has a place.  Ohhhhh, if only I were rich, and could buy all those matching totes, in white no less, and not worry about them collecting dust and soon turning first murky gray, and they ashy black.    Yes, me and my imagination, enjoyed ourselves today.  The only thing that would have made it better would be if I had a buddy with me, another mom, who was on holiday from her kids too.  And ice cream.   Ice cream  makes the world a much better place.
