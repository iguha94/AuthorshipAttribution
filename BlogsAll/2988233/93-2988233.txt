I don't talk about it much.&nbsp; Hardly ever in fact.&nbsp;   I'm adopted.&nbsp; No, there is no shame in that.&nbsp; In fact, I am grateful to God for giving me to the parents he did.&nbsp; I grew up feeling like&nbsp; princess, I have always known I am loved.&nbsp; Never for one minute have I doubted it.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp;   My birth mother was 18 when she got pregnant with me.&nbsp; This was a time when girls were shunned for getting knocked up.&nbsp; More than one girl found herself married to a guy she hardly knew, because she had caved in to his charm.&nbsp; This wasn't the case with my bio mom, who I will refer to as BM.&nbsp;   In high school, she was one of THOSE girls, the girl guys knew would give in.&nbsp; She made fun of the goody-goody girls.&nbsp; Picked on them unmercilessly.&nbsp; One of those girls would become my older sister one day.&nbsp; Ironic huh.&nbsp;   BM worked at a Shoney's restaurant, as a waitress.&nbsp; Her boss was my sperm donor.&nbsp; She was 18, he was in his late 20's married, with 3 kids.&nbsp; Not a good combination.&nbsp; Of course, he wasn't interested in the fact he had knocked her up.&nbsp; He could care less.&nbsp; All of the boys who hung out at the restaurant were just glad she hadn't put the blame on them.&nbsp; One of them was my future brother.&nbsp; More irony.  When I was 4 months old, I had a baby sitter, who would one day be my older sister also.&nbsp; Yet more irony.&nbsp;   BM called the parents of the baby sitter, goody-goody girl, and punk from the restaurant, and asked these nice folks if they wanted her baby.&nbsp; They needed to talk about it, I mean the wife was 45, and the husband was 48.&nbsp; Their kids were all grown up, the youngest was 15 (the babysitter).&nbsp; DId they really want to do this again.&nbsp; Tie themsleves down to someones elses child?&nbsp;   Mom, wanted to see this baby.&nbsp; When she showed up to visit, I was 4 months old, living in a room with a dog and her 10 puppies.&nbsp; My diaper hadn't been changed in days.&nbsp; There was a crust of milk caked to my scalp 1/4 inch thick.&nbsp; I was sick.&nbsp; Very, very sick.&nbsp; Mymom went straight home and told my dad to "go get that baby"&nbsp;.&nbsp; He decided to check things out, took a friend of his with him, and once he saw me, he loved me, just like mom had.&nbsp; They brought me home, right then and there.&nbsp;   Fast forward 23 years later, and BM calls my parents.&nbsp; She wants to meet me.&nbsp; If I am willing.&nbsp;   Considering the fact that I know absolutly nothing about myself, I agree.&nbsp; I wanted to know who my sperm donor was, I wanted to know my medical history, I wanted to see someone that maybe, just maybe I looked like.&nbsp; Or that looked like me.&nbsp;   When we met, BM brought my grnadmother with her.&nbsp; I had never met a grandparent, that I remembered.&nbsp; My adoptive grandparents were gone before I was born, or soon after.&nbsp; I actually had a grandmother.&nbsp; I liked my grandmother.&nbsp; She was nice.&nbsp; Her daughter wasn't.   BM walked into my parents house, and thanked them for raising "her" daughter.&nbsp; She called my husband "her" son in law, referred to herself as "mamaw" to my son, telling my parents what an adorable "grandson" she had.&nbsp; She even had the nerve to scold my son.&nbsp; NOt a smart move.&nbsp; I tolerated the visit.&nbsp; I wanted to know about me.&nbsp; She showed me a pic of what was suppsedly my sperm donor, all I could really make out was his legs.&nbsp; She told me his name, all I remember was his last name was Baker.&nbsp; Then she told me he was dead.&nbsp; He had a bad heart.&nbsp; Passed away in his early 40's with a heart condition.&nbsp; He had a pacemaker at the age of 28.&nbsp; Thanks, I needed that.&nbsp;   over the next 5 years, I tolerated more visits.&nbsp; About 2 a year.&nbsp; Each one getting worse than the one before.&nbsp; Bm walked into my sick mother's bedroom and told her "you need to pray for OUR daughter, she has an attitude problem"&nbsp; I did have an attitude problem, it was her.&nbsp; I couldn't stand her.&nbsp; I cringed at the mention of her name.&nbsp; I would get nervous and jittery days before a visit from her.&nbsp; When my boys were born during that time, I made Tommy and others swear not to tell her I had another child.&nbsp; I banned her from the hospital, I avoided her phone calls.&nbsp;   The last visit came after Jamie was born.&nbsp; He was 4 months old and she came to visit.&nbsp; On that visit, she referred to Will by his full name, he was 2 years old, and didn't know his full name.&nbsp; When he didn't respond to her, she yelled at him.&nbsp; That was the last straw.&nbsp;   I took her outside to my parents back porch, and more emotions than I have ever experienced came out.&nbsp; I let her know exactly how I felt.&nbsp; Let her know how many lines she had crossed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her that she had no right to walk in my life and expect to be my mother, she gave that right up when she chose her mother over me.&nbsp;   I let her know how it felt to know that I was a reject, rejected by my own mother, the woman who carried me for almsot 9 months, gave me to total strangers.&nbsp; I let her know how i felt the day she told me "don't you let me go to a nursing home when I get old"&nbsp; WHAT?????????&nbsp;   Then I knew why she contacted me.&nbsp; She had just found out her own mom had Lupus, and she was scared.&nbsp; Scared of being alone.&nbsp; BM had never married, never had any more kids, it was just her and her mom.&nbsp; It was her choice.&nbsp; She had to live with it.&nbsp;   But now, she wanted me back.&nbsp; You know what, I didnt' care.&nbsp;   I still don't.&nbsp;   I may sound bitter, I'm not bitter.&nbsp; I'm indifferent.&nbsp;   I haven't spoke to her in 8 years.&nbsp; My grandmother used to sneak while BM was at work and call me every couple of months.&nbsp; The calls stopped 3 years ago.&nbsp; I think my grandmother may have passed away.&nbsp; I hate the fact that she and I couldn't have a relationship.&nbsp; I wanted a relationship with my grandmother.&nbsp; She couldn't help the&nbsp; choices her daughter made.&nbsp;   I am very thankful I didn't grow up with BM.&nbsp; I would have been a bitter, cold person today.&nbsp; I'm not that person because she made one good decision in her life.&nbsp; She let me go.  &nbsp;
