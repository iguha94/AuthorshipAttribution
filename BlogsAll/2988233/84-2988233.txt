Remember growing up how saturday was THE best day of the week.  You would get up early, on your own, with no parental encouragement.  Drag your blankey, pillow to the living room, right in front of the TV.  Only getting up to grab the box of Crunch Berries, and a glass of coke.  Maybe you would get up and pee once.    Then you would lay there all day, until all the Saturday cartoons go off.  Never moving, not playing outside, nothing.  That was before cartoon network, toon disney, and nickelodeon came along.  Now kids have access to cartoons 24/7, anytime you want a cartoon, you can find one.   Not so when I was growing up.  the only time we got cartoons was on Saturday mornings.  Scooby Doo, bugs bunny, speed racer, were weekly staples.  We were also a skinny bunch.  No obese kids then.  Why?  Because we didn't lay on our butts all day long watching TV and playing video games.  We read books.  We played outside.  We used our imaginations.   I can remember making a mud island in our yard.  I took tree branches and made them the trees on my mountain.  Used my brothers lincoln logs to build the houses.  His hot wheels were the vehicles.  Barbie was the queen to Ken's king.  I even put a moat around the castle.  Would my kdis do that today?  No.  And I have all boys!   Now if their isn't electricity involved, kids won't play it.  They don't have imaginations, lincoln logs are "boring", hot wheels are for collectors, and they wouldn't dare play in mud.   They will play baseball, basketball, football, and such.  But nothing that doesnt' already come with the rules laid out.   I wish my kids had the saturdays I had, to my kids, saturday is just another day of the week.
