I made a boo boo.  You all know my dad is sick and won't go to the doc.  Well, he had told my sis about something a couple of weeks ago, and Thursday, she finally told me about it.    Seems as if he woke up one  morning with blood down his leg from his private parts.  He told her, and she told me this past week.  The day she told me, Dad was outside in the beating sun, with a tiller, tiling up the ground on a bank that is about 80 degree angle.  He can't hardly stand up on flat ground and here he is using machinery on a hill he cant stand on without falling.    So, I  fussed at him.  Big.  I have come to the decision that if he wants to kill himself working, fine.  But he had my two oldest sons working with him, trying to get them to use the chain saw.  When they wouldn't he got out the chain saw and was using it on a tree above their heads.  Needless to say, I was a bit upset.  This morning, I call my sis about a non family matter, and she mentions dad's new symptom.  And asks if he ever talked to me aobut it.  I told her yes, after I brought it up.  Now she is mad at me, because I mentioned it to dad.    Sheesh, yesterday it was government politics, today it is family politics.  I jsut can't win.
