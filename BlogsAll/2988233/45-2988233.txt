It is very, very quiet around here.  No one is talking.  Tommy went to bed last night without telling any of us good night.  Just walked in the bed room and shut the door.  I am getting worried about him.  It is like yesterday he made some turning point from trying to giving up.    I am going to try to talk to him tonight.  I have thought about writing him a email and sending it to him.  He hates it when I cry, and I know I can't have this talk with him and not have major tears.    I feel like I need to reassure him that I love him, that I am determined to make it thru this rough patch, and that I need his help in getting thru.  If only one of us is working on our marriage, it isn't going to make it.  We both have to dig in and stand firm.    How am I doing? Well, I am worried, but I also have the ultimate comforter with me.  I know God is with me, I can feel him.  Even though the conversation between Tommy and my mom terrified me , I felt calm.  That scared me too.  But I know God was keeping his hand on me, letting me know he is in control.  I just have to be willing to accept whatever his will is.  That is the hard part.    I would never have dreamed in all my married life that I would be in this position today.  You know they say that two in three marriages end in divorce.  I would look couples I know, and say, well out of us three, we are the only ones who will make it.  Why, because we  both had God in our marriage and in our lives.    I know that God can take care of this, Tommy has to let him.  Tommy has to be willing to give himself over to God.  I just worry what it will take to get him to that point.
