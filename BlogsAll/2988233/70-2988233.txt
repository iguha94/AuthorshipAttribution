You can tel lyesterday was Friday, it is this running theme for the past month or so that everything can and will happen on Friday.    Luckily most of it was happening to people  I know, not to us.    The neighbor's daughter decided to run away.  She is 16, and really cute, my boys have a crush on her.  She didn't come home from school yesterday, so her parents called the cops.  Later that night, they found her at a friends house.  I think she is jsut a mixed up kid.  I haven't seen any signs of drugs or alcohol abuse, and her parents really seem to be good parents.  I have seen her boyfriend running out the back door, up the hill pulling his clothes on when her parents come home from work.  Funny, but sad at the same time.  Renee had to deal with doctors all day yesterday.  Had to take Savannah to be checked by the pediatrician, and to the hospital for labs, so most of her day was spent with worry, stress and just basic headachy stuff.  I know she will be so glad to get to the beach tomorrow.    Oh, the one thing that did relate directly to us, Tommy had to go to the doctor, they wanted to check and see if he had a heart attack, they told him it was stress.  Put him on anit-depressants.  Yipeeeeeeee.  I am so glad he finally agreed to take them.  phew, I can breathe a little easier now and pray the side effects aren't bad, and he doesn't stop taking them.    HE came in with samples, so I asked them what they were, he says "crazy pills, ok, you have finally driven me to crazy pills."  I told him no, he isn't crazy, just depressed, there is a difference.  ANd that almost everyone we know is on them.    I am going to have to find a cheap lilac candle, the blooms on my lilac tree are wilting now, and I love going to sleep smelling the lilacs.  It makes for good dreaming.
