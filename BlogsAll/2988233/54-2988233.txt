Last night was a bad night for my parents.  THey are both in their 80's, and in declining health.  My mom, has had health problems all her life, uses a walker now, and basically has to have someone with her at all times.    My dad has always been strong as an ox, but a couple of months ago, he had a stroke, didn't realize he was having one, too stubborn to go to the hospital.  And since then, he has been getting weaker.    Around 1:30am, he calls, he is having dzzy spells, and can't stand on his legs without falling,and mom is having a bad night.  He needs me to come stay with them.    Me and Tj go up, and dad can't lay down without falling.  Literally fallilng while in bed.  I don't understand how, but while already laying down he managed to fall ontop of mom, which considering her size and the fact her side of hte bed is 6 inches higher than his, was no small accomplishment.    Mom, had slept all day, and was wide awake, wondering from room to room, unable ot sleep.  Which in her fragility isn't good.  She weighs over 250 lbs, and is not a easy woman to get up when she falls.  She has no strength in her legs or upper body, and you have to literally pick her up and put her in a chair or in bed.  4:30am, she is still awake, dad is still awake, all sitting in the living room watching TV, mom is wanting someone to go to the drug store, not listening when we tell her it doesn't open for another 6 hours.    6 am, mom is still awake, dad is still awake, they make me go home.  They promise to go to bed and stay.    Tommy suggested tonight we ask my parents to move in with us.  We only life at the bottom of their driveway, in the house that I grew up in, their home for 50 years.  To me, it sounds good, but how to talk them into it.  They are so stubborn and independant.    I dont' really see any other option other than resigning myself to spending my nights sitting up with them.
