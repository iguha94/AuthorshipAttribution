The boys are watching Rugrat's Gone Wild.  It is part of Jamie's birthday present.   SInce we couldn't buy him an actual present, we let him go rent 1 movie and 1 video game.  He got to pick both of them buy himself.  THen, when we have a bit to spare, we will get him a present.    He has had a good day.  First, the neighbor kids Benjamin and Nickolas came down, then Kenny came down, then EJ and Savannah came down.  IT was a blast having all those kids at the house. I love having all those kids around.    Stan came down for a few minutes bringing Savannah's milk to her.  We talked the boys into exploring the creek and the tunnel that goes under the highway.  When Tommy got home, he as less than pleased, he is afraid one of them will get snake bit.  I remember playing in that creek when ever I was little, same thing for Stan, him and my younger brothers used to STAY in that creek all summer long.  Their is grafitti on the walls of the tunnel to prove it.  Which our sons saw today.  Too funny, they came out, "so Stan, you all were just like us at our age?????"  Then we went up to papaw's house and I baked his cake, and made a pan of Ziti.  Jamie loves Ziti, which is strange, I use to have to bribe him to eat it, not he asked for it for his birthday dinner!  Renee, Savannah, Ej, Kenny all came and ate a bite of supper and cake with ice cream with Jamie.  Renee took some video for us, mainly for Savannah's sake, it was her first brithday party!!!!  All in all. it was a good day.  I cleaned a little today, not much, my teeth and jaw have been giving me a fit.  Today was the first day I HAD to take a pain pill during the day.  I normally save them for bed time so I can sleep.    Which reminds me, sleep, I need that.  I am going to bed.  I have to get all 6 boys up for showers int he morning.  Fun, fun, fun........
