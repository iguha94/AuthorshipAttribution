Im using Tommy's laptop to do this, it is really awkward.  I'm not used to this small keyboard.  He does this foreign exchange stuff,and it mostly moves during the night, so he is up and down all night, watching his charts, and stuff, so right now he is napping so he can stay up tonight.  I am watching the charts move.  I have been playing Tetris so long, my shoulder aches.  I link it off of either Shara's or Dawn's blog.  Whichever I happen to look at first.  I love tetris, that is one video game I can do.  Today has been a pretty good day.  I have stayed in a good mood today, kept my s pirits up, I even wore jeans around the house today, I NEVER wear jeans around the house.  I used to when I was skinnier, but not since having 5 kids in 9 years.  They just don't make jeans that fit a body that has given birth so many times.    The weather was great today, the boys and Savannah played outside a lot today.  I walked around the yard alot today.  Looking at all the new plant life that is sprouting.  I don't have any tulips this year, I didn't really expect to.  The boys tromp all over my tulip bed every time I set them out, so I didn't bother this go around.  But my Zinnias, at least I think that is what they are , are sprouting.  I love those flowers.  At first when we moved into the house and I saw those, I thought they were this really strange looking weed.  Then t hey bloomed.  Oh they are so gorgeous.    The lilacs are showing buds, and the weeping cherry tree is starting to flower out.  When it gets to full flower, I'm going to take the boys pics in front of it.    It is amazing, spring, is such a fresh start.  With all the plant life, and I am going to try to make it a fresh start for me in my spiritual life.  I am fighting the depression as hard as I can, taking my meds, and just fighting.  So I am more determined than usual to get past it right now.  Fresh start, it is time for me to start budding, so God can make me into a beautiful flower.
