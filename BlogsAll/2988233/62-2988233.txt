Son #5 is sick.  He has been running a temp of 103 F, and hte threw up earlier.  He is feeling better now, but that is just the Motrin talking.    Bless his heart.  It ahs been so long since we have had sickness in the house, I don't have a thermometer, no fever meds, nothing.  My kids are very rarely sick.  So this one has thrown us for a loop.  I had to borrow Motrin from Renee, and her thermometer, and she came down and tried to look down his throat with a flash light.    That is one  HUGE  advantage of homeschooling, the kids aren't exposed to all those germs, bringing them home and sharing the wealth with each other.  It is so nice!   BUT  the bad thing is, he was playing at Renee's all day with Savannah,and I am praying Savannah doesn't get it.  She has to be hospitalized if she gets a stomach bug.   AND  he was helping my brother and his friend this morning, they both have compromised immune systems.  I went out side and warned them when I got sick.  I hope they dont' get it either.  Especially B.  He is just now getting his T cells balanced out.    Upset stomach and the kid wants meatloaf!  He has bugged me all night for meatloaf.  I did cave and give him mashed potatoes at supper time.  They are his favorite food.  He kept them down.  I really think the vomitting spell came from the fever spiking so good.  Then taking in cold gatorade and medicine on an already hot stomach.
