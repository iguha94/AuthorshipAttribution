I havent' been on the computer much the past few days.  In fact, I have been avoiding it, trying to keep my mind and my body busy.    I had a short heart to heart with Tommy the other night at 4am.  basically, he asked me a question and I told him what I thought.  I had been waiting to tell him he needed to give control of his life and all  its problems to God.  So I finally got to.  I also told him he might see his doctor about some "happy " pills.  I know he his thinking about it.  ON this group board I belong to,  one of my closest friends from there, made a coment that has made half the board upset.  I feel for MJ so much.  I know she didn't mean for it to sound the way it came out.  YOu can't tell feeling in written words, you can't hear emotion.  BLess her heart.  I am praying for her.  I know that this has hurt her just as much as the others involved.    Renee is gone to Chapel Hill with Savannah.  They won't be back until last THursday night.  I miss having Savannah around.  Ej was supposed to stay with us but changed his mind the day before they left.  I wonder why.  I also wonde rif it is because of Tommy.  I really hope not.  I honestly do.    Mom and Dad got a dog today.  His name is Jake, he is a two year old Jack Russell Terrier.  He is adorable.  They lvoe him to death.  The girl who owned him just got divorced, and is working full time plus going to school and just doesnt' have the time to spend with him.  It broke her heart to give him up.
