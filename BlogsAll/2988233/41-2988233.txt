I went to the doctor today! YEAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!  Turns out, I don't have an abcessed tooth, I have TMJ.  I had kind of suspected I had it for a while now, but today the doctor confirmed it.  Gave me pain pills, antibiotics just incase the tooth is starting to abcess, and told me to get to a dentist.  Ok.  Casey's arm isn't broken.  HUH?????? Well, we went tohte orthopedic doctor yesterday, and he said it isnt' broken.  How it went from two doc's saying it was broken on Sun night, to not being broken on Tuesday, I have no clue.  But he took it out of the splint, and removed all restrictions on him, and he has been doing just fine.  I complains about it getting tired easily, but not hurting.    So I am just full of news today huh.  I was talking to Lori on the phone today, and we wer talking about houses and daddy selling ours, she said "shoot, tell them to give you $150,000 for it and go move into a new one."  I told her teh tax appraisal put this house and the land at $225,000.  She said "there is no way YOUR house is worth more than MINE"   lol.  She jsut couldn't get over it.   Gave Tommy a chuckle anyhow.  She lives in a well known subdivision, we live in a 50 year old house.  BUT, in the past few years all around our little old house these VERY high end subdivisions have been going in.  W are talking one just up the road with $500,000 houses in it.  So of course our land value is going up.  It has to.  lol.  I'm still smiling about that.   Tomorrow I get to keep EJ and Savannah, Vann has been bugging Renee wanting to see her "G" .  She needs her "G" fix.  I think EJ needs his cousin fix too.lol.  That is ok, "G" needs her EJ and Savannah fix too.
