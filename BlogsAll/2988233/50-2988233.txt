Don't you just love the place.  They are cheaper on everything you want to buy, so you just have to buy all you need, whether you have the money or not.    Not a good thing.  I went to Wally's World today, to buy laundry stuff, toilitries, and cleaning stuff. I want some gardening stuff.  I want a tin watering can.  I want hanging baskets for my front porch, I want a flower garden.  And I want it now.  DID YOU HEAR ME?????? NOW!    Maybe next spring I can get my ducks in a row and get my stuff planted on time.  I am such a procrastinater.  A local radio station is doing a room makeover contest.  You send them pics of the room you want new furniture for and they pick the winner. I am entering our living room.  We have a couch, and chair.  That is it for seating.  There are 7 of us.  Do the math, it doesnt' fit.  Plus the couch and chair are both falling apart.  Literally, busting at the seams.  THe seams of the fabric are coming apart, you can see the innards of the couch.  (liek the word innards?  It's southern!)  I could have spent $500 in walmart very easily today.  We all need new clothes, shoes, linens, towels, and I am on a cleaning organizing spree.  I want everything to be organized to perfection.  But don't have the stuff I want to organize with.  So frustrating.
