I mentioned in the post below about Son #3 jabbering on about Shrek 2.    Son #3, is a special child.  I know you are thinking "all mom's say that about their kids"  And I do think all my boys are special.  This one is just more special.    All my boys were fast walkers, talkers, they did everything early.  Except #3, he never uttered a sound.  No coo's, goo's dada, nothing. The only noise we ever heard out of him was cry's that he didnt' do that often.  SO at age 22 months, he started speech therapy.  At that age, he uttered his first sound.  Until he was 4 years old, his speech was so un-inteligable (is that a word?) that only I could understand him.  Even Tommy had a hard time deciphering.    ONce he started talking,and people could understand him, and he realized this, it was on.  And has been on for 6 years since.  He tells everyone, "I couldn't talk for so long, I have lots to say, so I talk all the time now."    And he does.  It is near impossible to keep him quiet.  He remembers every detail of every movie, show, cartoon, he has ever watched.  And will be glad to tell you all those details, anytime the urge hits him.  Don't try to stop him, it does no good.  Jsut nod, uhhuh, yeah, right, really, that is so cool, at the appropriate times, and he is fine.  Until the silence.  Silence somes when he has asked your opinion of all he has just said.  Then you ahve to get creative.    I know you are all thinking "she ignores him?????" Bad mommy.  But sometimes it saves my sanity.  I only ignore when he is relating every detail of all 5 Star War movies in order, scene by scene, line by line, and even describing the background and props.  Not during importan conversations like how his day has gone, or what the latest trouble he is having with which ever brother is getting on his nerves.    YOu know, he may talk alot, but I love this quality about him.  It makes him special.
