For soem reason, Saturday has turned into my work outside day.  I am a stay at home mom, so I could concievably work outside every day of the week.  But for some reason, I am drawn to work in the yard.    Growing up, I was never allowed to work in the yard.  I grew up in a old fashioned family where then man's work was outside and the woman's work was inside.  My dad didn't believe a woman should mow the yard, my mom couldn't tell you how to start a lawn mower much less actually do the yard.  Me, well, I love it.  I don't ever do it, I have five boys, they do the yard work.    But today, I have been weeding my flowers, and trying to decide what I want to do to my side yard, I want to make it a place of refuge, to go of the evening to sit, think, read, or just be.  I want a peaceful place, a place where the kids can play nearby, and I can grill when I want to.    So now, I am trying to figure out what kind of ground cover for the bank,and find some shrubs or flowers that thrive in shade.  I have to have flowers,  the more the better.    I am envious of Renee's flower garden.  When she gets her pond in, I will be jsut flat out covetous.  Then when she puts the fish is, I will call myself "Green"  with envy.  Who knows, maybe next summer, I can get a pond, with a waterfall, fishes, and a little fountain.
