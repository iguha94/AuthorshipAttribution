I got a great suprise today, MJ one of my online friends called me.  I was so thrilled to hear from her.  It was the first time we had talked on the phone, so we probably spent too long!lol.  BUt that is ok.  It really helped talking to her.    When you are going thru life lessons, most of the time, you feel totally alone in the world, like no one out there understands or comprehends what you are living with.  Luckily have a couple of friends that do understand.  That I can talk to and just let it all hang out.  That i dont' have to sugar coat the truth or keep the icky details from.  To those friends, I thank you.  Evidently, from my posts and conversations yesterday, all could tell I was in bad shape.  And truthfully, I was.  I am a bit better today. I am trying.  I got one email yesterday telling me to call my doctor ASAP.  Wow what a radar.    I had to call Tommy at work and give him even more bad news.  He got very quiet on the other end.  TJ asked me yesterday if me and Dad were going to seperate.  I told him I wasn't planning on it.  And I'm not.  I know that me and Tommy can get thru this, we just have to pull together and work together to do so.  Two are stronger than one.
