Here we go again.  Tommy called me from work today to tell me that Capital One had called him at work.  SO as a result, he is getting his ONE week paid vacation in pay tomorrow, so we can send them $400 tomorrow.  NO, he will have to go an entire year without vacation.  Not that we could go anywhere, but the point of the matter is, he would be off a week, no gettingup early, just lazy days of doing nothing.  Now, we get nothing at all.    I honestly can't stand bill collectors.    SO, He is in the living room right now figuring out our bills, getting more and more tense and quieter and quieter towards me.  Thanks Matt Nelson, collection agent for capital one.  I really appreciate it.  Last night I thought we were going to the ER.  Tommy started having a horendous headache, chest pains, his heart rate was too fast, and he was dizzy, and nauseous.  Now, we have been thru this before, he has high blood pressure, and stopped taking his medicine a couple of weeks ago.  He also stopped taking his arythmia medicine.  We can't afford it.  So, I just knew he was either having a heart attack, or a stroke, one of the two.  His head kept hurting, waking him up at 4 am.  He went on to work, I called his doctor, they wanted him to go to the ER, he wouldn't, so they want to see him in the morning.  I have no idea whether or not he will go.    I have more stuff to rant about, but my heart is beating fast, I am getting upset, so I will stop ranting now.  Maybe later.
