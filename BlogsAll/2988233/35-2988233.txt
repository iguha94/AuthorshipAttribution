Have you ever noticed how hard it is to have a conversation with a pubecent boy?  Anything you say, can and will be held against you, taken in the wrong context, and in some way, shape or form, turned into something sexual.  Background, I have a 14 yr old and a 12 yr old.  For some reason, watching television and using expressions are off limits.    Example: my husband and I were watching American Idol, my husband smiled when one of the girls hit her notes,  to my sons, they saw "dad thinks she's hot"  I saw " yep, she did good"  Example:  Hubby and I talking while children are in another room, 14 yr old walks in "what? what were you saying about me?????"   Example: hubby hugs me and kisses me for no reason.  "Oh man, stop it, stop it, don't do that" comes from BOTH the 12 yr old and the 14 yr old.  "don't you two have enough entertainment"   I think scientist should one day try to explain the phenomenon.  I would pay good money to know hwo it is you are supposed to act and talk around this children.     On another note, weren't the women fantastic on American Idol tonight?????  They just keep getting better and better.  Even Jasmine did good tonight.  Diana just needs to put feeling in.  Personally, I thought Red John did better tonight than he has in the past few weeks.  He seemed to feel more at home with the Barry Manilow songs.   still don't like George Huff.
