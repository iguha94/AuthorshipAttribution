Normally, I don't suffer from a little thing we women call PMS.  But for some reason, I am PMSING like crazy.  Not a good thing around here.  The only woman in a house full of men, who do not understand what mood swings, chocolate cravings, etc mean.    We had baked ziti for supper tonight.  I have to have chocolate after eating anything with garlic.  Well of course we have no chocolate in the house.  So I tell Tommy, I need chocolate, "no you don't" well, I beg to differ. Women need chocolate as much as or more than men need sex.  I'm sorry that discription may offend a few people, but that is how I feel.  I know that I would feel so much better right now with just one bite, just one, of a Hershey's chocolate bar.  No almonds, just plain ole choclate.    Or I could make do with a pint of Haagen Daaz strawberry cheesecake ice cream.  I don't want chocolate ice cream.  That is for the candy bar, to savor and let the milk chocolate melt in my mouth.  Maybe on my fingers.  MMMMMMM.  Ice Cream is meant for Haagen Daaz, which I am probably speling wrong.  I normally will go for the Ben and Jerry's but our local stores have stopped carrying my favorite flavor Triple Carmel Chunk.  Nothin else is even close.   Everythign but the... is a close second, but stillnot all that carmel.  ANd believe me, nobody makes strawberry cheesecake ice cream like HD does.  I tried Edys Dreamery, no where close.  NOt even on the same map.    So, do I sound like a live, walking talking case of PMS to you??????
