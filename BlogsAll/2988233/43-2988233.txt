I hate doctors.  There that is said.  I have spent most of the day trying to get Casey in with the orthopedic doctor.  His regular one can't see him because his schedule is full. So he referred him to another doc inthe same practice.    I started this process at 9:30am, at 3pm I still hadn't heard anything, I call them, they tell me they are waiting for the doctor to decide WHICH patient he will see WHEN.  What is there to decide.  Just schedule the patients.  So I tell her that Casey isnt' in a firm cast, he can move his arm, and he isnt' supposed to be able to move it.  IT is broke into the growth plate, and it can be danagerous if he moves it the wrong way.  We went thru this last year, then, he was in a cast so tight, so hard that he couldn't move his arm at all.  This time, they put him in a softer cast, thinking he would be getting in to the doctor today.    8pm, still no appointment.  They called around 5pm and had to put Tommy on hold, lost the call, and didn't call back.  So, I get to start this whole process in the morning.  I will not be as nice this time around.  I try to be understanding, but I've had it, this is my son's future here.  If that arm moves the wrong way,  he will have to have surgery to repair it.  We don't need to have surgery.  Not now.   R. is having a rough time right now.  I wish I could help her, relive some of her stress, but I can't.  All I can do is pray for her.  Which I do all the time.    ME and daddy went to sam's today.  He was in such a spunky mood.  I haven't seen him like that in a long long time.  He was so funny.  Me and Casey cracked up the entire time.  HEr eis this 84 year old man, and he was so funny.  I asked him if he took too much medication today.  LOl.
