believe it or not, the mood still lasts!  WHooohoooo 2 days in a row.  i am amazed.    Church this morning was fantastic.  The Holy Spirit was all over the place, it just felt so good to be there.  Daddy preached about he 7 Certainties of Christ.  I was just awesome.    When we got home from church, Shane and Bobby are here working on converting the bus to a motor coach.  They are going to start showing dogs, so they need it for their travels.  It is really cool looking, they have almost all of the inside torn out.  You wouldn't think there would be so much room inside a bus, but there is.   The race is boring today, when I left the living room, TOny Stewert was 5 seconds ahead of Kasey Kahne.  Half the field is a lap down, can't stand races that spread out.  They just aren't interesting.  So Tommy is switching between the race and the ACC championship game.  Duke is having a bit of trouble with Maryland.  Not good for my blue devils.  I have to tell you that GOd has blessed me with $40 today.  Now, to let you know how rough it has been, we only had $20 for groceries this week.  That is for 7 people 3 meals a day.  SO I went and got the absolute neccessary stuff.  Then today, I was headed to get 2 loaves of bread, I had $3.  Someone handed me $20 and told me to go get us something for lunch.  Then when I got home, Someone knocked on my door and gave me $20 more.  Isn't God amazing?  He promised he would take care of our needs, and he is doing so.  That was one of the certainties  Daddy preached on this morning.    I think I am going to go nap.  Sunday is always a good nap day.  And I am bored.  Napppppppyyyyy sounds really good.
