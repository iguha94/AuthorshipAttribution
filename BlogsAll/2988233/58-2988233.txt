little by little, I am feeling better.    Thanks to EVERYONE who has sent me well wishes and prayers.  I needed them.    Tommy and the boys have taken very good care of me, they know that for mom to lay around all day in bed, she must be sick.  So they have cooked and everything.    My tonsils no longer feel like glof balls, just maybe those dime gum balls now.   IF it lets you know anything, I didnt' even talk to Renee' all day yesterday!  That is bad.    I watched American Idol tonight,a nd wasn't that impressed untilt he very last song.  Diana kicked butt on that song.  she made the change over and everything.  Brought me chill bumps and tears! And singing in front of CLive Davis..... I would be so nervous I wouldn't even get out a note. Talk about pressure.  I mean it is CLIVE DAVIS.  Do you know who he is???????   My predictions, Fantasia will be voted because the state of Hawaii will jam the phone lines again.  But she will be ok, She WILL get a record contract when it is over, just like LaToya will.  Jasmine needs to win, that is the only way she will get a contract.   My SIL is taking the boys to see Shrek 2 tomorrow, Tommy said if he knew that, he would have went to work today and been off tomorrow so he could see it too!  I am looking forward to it.  Shrek is a good movie.
