We have ahd a pretty good day today.  I was kind of dreading it, last night, after the good stuff with Tommy, he went to turn on his laptop, and it wouldn't start.  He has had it barely a year.  So, he starts going thru the troubleshooting process, and nothing.  He happens to read the chapter on what to do if dropped, trys that stuf, and it worked.  Evidently, one of the boys has kocked the laptop over and not told us.  BUt, Tommy handled it VERY well.  HE honestly didn't show any anger.  I think he was just thankful it works again.  I started my meds again.  I had ran out of them,a nd kept forgetting to call the refill in.  IT takes 24-48 hours after you call it in to get the refill, so I had been out for almost a week.    Tommy's dr.s office sent us a $10.  check today, may not seem like much, but let me tell you, it bought bread, sugar and tea.  Yes for those of you that have read below, I am out of sugar.  lol.  That 25 lbs didnt' last very long at all.  HE had paid that much over his co-pay last visit, so they refunded it.  Nice.  I about died tonight when the called out Latonya's name as one of the bottom 3 on American Idol.  She is my bet to win the whole thing.  Poor John, he knew he was gonna lose, then when he didn't, he looked like he would cry.  I figured Amy would be out soon, but Can't understand the deal with Camille. She really can't sing.  I think the boys are voting for her.  It will be really bad if she wins because all the teenage boys think she is hot.   Cause she can't sing.  AM I babbling yet?????? I do believe so!
