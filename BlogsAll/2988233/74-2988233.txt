We had a stress free day yesterday.    It has been so long since we had one of those.    TOmmy's family had a get together, his oldest sister was in from Boca, so we all got together to have a cookout.    We road 4 wheelers, the boys played football, found money with a metal detector, lit a bonfire fter dark, and just basically enjoyed being around each other.  It was so nice.  No phone to answer, no body on earth knew how to get in touch with us.  SO we jsut hung out and enjoyed life.    Lana, my sil, has a house on top of a mountain, down this long dirt road, so we were in the boonies.  I like the boonies.  ha,ha.  The kids could play without worrying if they were too loud, we could tear dirt up with the 4 wheeler and not worry about someone compaining.  Tommy made me scream.  I road with him, and some man who was riding his wife on their 4 wheeler, said he wanted to see Tommy jump a hill with me on the back.  He took off, I ducked my head behind his back and screamed like a sissy girl.  Thanks to the brake system Polaris has on the 4 wheelers, you can go fast as you can,a nd then let off the gas, and the brake automaticaly slows you down, well, he waited until aobut 2 feet from the hil and let off the gas.  I just knew we were going airborne.  Which would have been fun if all my inlaws weren't watching.  Knowing my luck I would have bounced off the backend of the thing and landed on my tuckus.  Too bad the boys missed hearing mom scream.  They were all too busy tackling their uncle to notice mom was getting the crap scared out of her.    Now, I want a 4 wheeler and a house in the boonies.
