Rainy day's and Monday's always get me down...The Carpenter's sure knew what they were talking about.  This is a rainy Monday here is NC.  Just one of those cuddle up with a good book by the fire days.  Too bad I dont' ahve a good book or a fire!   I have EJ and Savannah today. She has been soooo happy today.  That is a good sign.  Ej and the other boys got into huge trouble this morning.  THey awere all playing outside and they all went to the bus stop without me knowing.  Here they are up at the highway with Noah, Savannah, and Scrufty.  I let them have it when they got home.  SO I am making them stay inside and clean.  It would help if it wasn't raining now, the impact would be more.  Oh well.  Lori called and Seth is playing on a travel baseball team, just as a fill in player.  She said Casey could play with him if TOmmy would say yes.  I talked to him about it.  Still waiting for an answer.  I know it is killing Tj and Casey both because they are getting to play this year.  Oh I wish we could get the van fixed.  Its already been 6 months without it.    My blood sugar is messed up today, I keep getting the shakes.  I took a nap with Savannah this morning.  It helped for awhile, but now I have the shakes again.  I think I need to have a glucose test done.    TJ cleaned out the refridgerator last night.  He did really good.  Did it all byhimself without anyone asking too!  He used my Mr. Clean Eraser thingy.  Those things are amazing.  I mean they do stuff that a scrub brush and squirt stuff won't budge.  With hardly any effort too!    Mom and dad are taking Me, Tommy and TJ and Casey to see The Passion of The Christ Wednsday.  ALl my friends that have seen it have jsut been so taken with emotion.  I am looking forward to it, and dreading it at the same time.  I know I will cry, just thinking about what Christ did for me, ......
