Today I kept my nephews, Seth, Colby, and Heath.  And I kept Savannah. I all went really well, they are all good kids.  Honest.    Heath and Savannah are only about 5 weeks apart in age, so it was fun to watch them together.  Both would complain about the other one taking their turn, Heath tried to eat Savannah's food (big no-no) and got upset when I didn't ahve a sippy of milk for him.  He wanted Savannah's.  He probably would have puked right there in the kitchen floor if he had tasted hers.  (it has one of her meds in it.)  But they did good.  The best part was when they were riding skateboards with Noah.  Now mind you, Noah is 3 years older than them, but basically the same size as them.  Taller, but not much.    Noah is on the front of the board, then Heath, then Savannah.  ALl in sitting positions.  When they say  "one,dwo,fwee, goooooo" they all ift their feet up, and Noah grabs the skateboard, Heath grabs Noah's shoulders, Savannah grabs Heath's shoulders, and down the hill they go.  (small incline)  then at the bottom of the hill, when they stop, they all fall off, to the ground acting like they crashed.  I tried to video it, but as usual, my camcorder battery was dead.  No wonder I don't have any pics of my kids.  My battery is always dead.
