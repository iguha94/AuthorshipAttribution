There is nothing worse in life than having a sick child.&nbsp;   It evokes all the feelings of&nbsp; helplessness, inadaquacy, and just plain old fear.   Jamie is sick.&nbsp; While on date night, the phone rings, and Renee tells me that I have a sick boy.&nbsp; He is running a temp, and has thrown up.&nbsp; We head home right away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Renee sent Jamie to our house with TJ, since we would be home so soon.&nbsp; Savannah can't be exposed to illness.&nbsp; Any kind of virus will put her in the hospital.&nbsp; I pray she doesn't get this.   When we get home, I love on Jamie, and get him settled in bed.&nbsp; I lay beside him, listening to his breathing.&nbsp; It was so heavy and so fast.&nbsp; I could feel this heart beating thru the covers, his body heat was making me sweat.&nbsp; This was after giving him Motrin to bring it down.&nbsp; Every few seconds, low moans would escape, while the muscles in his legs were twitching from the heat.&nbsp;   He slept all evening, peacefully.&nbsp;   Then the chills hit.&nbsp; His skin was burning to the touch, his face was blood red, his eyes were blood shot, and still sunk in his head.&nbsp; We couldn't get him warm enough to stop the chills.&nbsp; It is 1am, and his is getting worse.&nbsp; His head is hurting so severely he can't move, talk, or really answer us.&nbsp;   By 2am, we are in the ER.&nbsp; They finally are able to get the temp down, and once it goes down, Jamie slowly returned to his normal self.&nbsp; He is cracking jokes with the doctor, sitting in bed making fun of his brother, talking about his favorite video game, and talking about the Atlanta Braves.&nbsp; My baby is back.   We have slept most of the day, he is still very sick.&nbsp; We are waiting on his blood culture to come back, sometime tomorrow, but he will be ok.&nbsp; Fevers are scary, especially for parents.&nbsp;
