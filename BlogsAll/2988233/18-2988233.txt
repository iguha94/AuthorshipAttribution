We just got thru watching   Blue Collar Comedy Tour , the DVD, let me tell you I have never laughed so much in my life.  It is hilarious.  And we watched it with all the boys.  I must say I am now a fan of Ron White.  He was so funny.  Of course, being from the south didn't help, and being quite redkneck my self, I could really identify with alot of the stories!lol.    Tommy tells me all the time that you just cant hide my redkneck, no matter how hard I try.  It is really obvious when you hear me speak.  I talked to a friend that I had met online, for the first time about a year ago, and her first words were " oh,,,,, your accent"  I give the words "southern drawl" a new meaning!  When we lived in Las Vegas, the people where I worked would make me  get on the public address system just to hear the customers laugh.  Yes, my drawl is that bad.  Most people don't think North Carolinians should have such accents, but I do.  I have even been told that my writing sounds southern!    I have to say thanks to Shara, of   Shara's ramblings .  Her site is great, and she has given me a lot of good ideas, and even shared html codes with me.  We have never met, just emailed for a couple of days and she has been extremely helpful.    I am hoping to add Renee's blog to my blog roll soon.  She is thinking of starting one, and I have been showing her  the neat stuff I have found.  So someday soon...  AHHHHH relief will be expanding, I have started a   homeschooling blog , just haven't done much with it yet.  I will get it up, and finished soon.    WE are going to see The Passion of the Christ tomorrow with Mom and Dad.  I am looking forward to it very much.  I am hoping and praying it will help deepen boht mine and Tommy's relationships with God.  Tj and Casey are going with us too.  WE figure it is probably to graphic for the other boys. Renee is babysitting.  Thanks Renee.
