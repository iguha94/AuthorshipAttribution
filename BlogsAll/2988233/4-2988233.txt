I have some great friends.  I just had to get that out there.  I want everyone to know that I have some of the greatest friends on earth.  I just read and email from MJ, she is half way accross the country and worried about me. I hope she knows it helps just knowing that somewhere in Minnesota, she is praying for me.  I know GOd is hearing her prayers, and that alone helps me.  she has been thru depression and all kinds of stuff with her family, and it kind of scares me that she is so worried.  I know she had been thru this and watches the signs. I also know she reads and sees what isnt' said.  But reading her email today helped.  Just seeing that ther are people i nthis world who aren't tired of hearing my gripe, or actually may be tired of hearing me gripe, but love me enough to listen and pay attention anyhow.  That is a true friend.  Then you throw in Renee.  Bless her heart.  She is dealing with her own stuff, she meets with the transplant team next week about getting Savannah's liver transplant done, and what does she do?  She calls me today wanting to know just why exactly I am still in bed.  I was cold.  I hadn't had my shower yet, and was cold, so I went back to bed.  It has been a dreary, rainy, chilly morning here in NC.  But she kicked my butt aware enough, I got up and showered, and haven't been back to bed since.  She has had to listen to a lot of stuff lately.  A lot.  She has been in my house, knows the status there, and still doenst' judge my husband.  THank you for that.  I know that this is just  a season that one day will pass.  I don't want to make judgements now that will affect how they see Tommy in the future.  Renee doesn't do that.  She too has been thru "stuff" galore.  She knows what to look for, and isnt' afraid to tell me to call my doctor.  ANother true friend.
