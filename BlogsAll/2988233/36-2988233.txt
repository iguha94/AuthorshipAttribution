I am a thief!  Jsut wanted to get that out there, look to the left side of the page, just above the tag board...See the little cartoon hyper chick??????? I stole her from Renee's site.  Yep, I did it, I admit it.  It was me.  There, I confessed, now take me away to the big soft room with all the foam and rubber on the walls.    We jsut watched Something's Got to Give.  It is good.  Even Tommy liked it.   I could have done without seeing Diane Keaton's boobs, but, it was still a good movie.  And I am probably in the minority, but I was really hoping she would end up with Keanu.  I would chose Keanu over Jack any day of the week.  I mean seriously, no contest.    I have been mean mommy today.  We worked hard on testing today in school, and when we do that, it gets me just a touch testy myself.  So when the boys got on my nerves too much, I (gasp) took away the Xbox!!!!!! YOu would have thought I commited the crime of the century.    I went for a ride with Renee' Savannah Noah, and Jamie and Will on the golf cart today.  It was so nice.  We went up this drive way that I hadn't been up, and there was this spot, where all the cattle were lowing, and the two hills met at a valley.  It was so peacefull.  Even sitting there with all those kids.  I could have sat there all day long.  I know that eventually the kids would have broken the trance, but hey, It would be nice while it lasted.    My lilac tree, bush, whatever it is, is blooming.  I love the smell of the lilacs.  I could sit all day by that tree and just inhale all the fragrance from the blooms.  There is just something about this time of year.  It is like getting  a new lease on life.  I jsut makes you...well...happy.
