I have a crick in my neck.  It is killing me.  Hurts to sit up, to lay down, to do anything in fact.    What have I been up to?  Well, let's see, Lori (tommy's sister) took the kids t fun depot yesterday, it is this new place in town with go karts, lazer tag, mini golf, a climbing wall, batting cages, and tons of video games.  The boys had a blast.  It was expensive, but they all have a blast.  Lori has 3 boys of her own, so between the two of us, there were 8 boys.  She is giving TJ and Jamie a combined birhtday party their.  They are already excited about it.   After paying the bills that had to be paid this week, all we had left was gas money.  No grocery money.  Not a good thing.  We are ok, though, just not eating like we are used to eating.  Like tonight I had a baked potato for supper, most of the boys did too, TJ had a couple of cheese sandwiches, and Tommy ate some leftover biscuits and gravy.  So its not like we are starving.    Tomorrow is TJ's birthday, ie will be 14.  I find it hard to believe I am the mother of a 14 year old.  Doesn't seem possible.  he is so excited.  Mom bought the cake mix and stuff for me to bake his cake, and her and daddy are cooking lunch after church tomorrow.  We are having Roast and fixin's yuuuummmmmm, I can almost smellthe roast cooking now.    Tommy asked me today about the Passion of the Christ.  I told him it was too hard to put into words to describe the movie.
