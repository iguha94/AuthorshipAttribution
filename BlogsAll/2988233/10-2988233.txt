Listening to Daniel Beddingfield.  Love this song about love.  The sermon at church tonight, Tommy would have loved.  It was about what a Pharisetic time we live in .  In other words how Christians spend more time judging each other than trying to witness to the lost, and make changes in the world.  It was good. Very good.  Supper is cooking, yes I know it is 9:39pm.  Bad, bad mommy I am. lol.  We always eat supper after church on Wed.  And, of course I had to watch American Idol.  I can't believe they voted Matt Rogers off.  Camille totally butchered Desperado, and has done lousy this whole time.  She should have been gone a long time ago.  Man, don't butcher a Eagles song.  That just ain't right.  I made a mistake in yesterdays blog about the scripture reference, I meant to say verse 13, not 23.  But if you read the entire set of scriptures you probably caught my mistake.    I have been doing pretty good today.  Actually, I read abook today.  The entire book.  "A Quarter for a Kiss" by MIndy Starns Clark, she is an inspirational mystery writer.  This is her latest book in the Million Dollar Mystery Series.  I really like this series.  I can't wait for her next book to come out.    Another author I like is Dee Henderson, I am halfway thru her O'Malley Series, and I love them.    Oh, and Jan Karon, I am very patiently awaiting the next and final book in the Mitford series, I will mis this bunch of characters so much.  I am not the type of person who can read a book more than once,I am the same way with movies, once I have seen it, don't make me sit thru it again.
