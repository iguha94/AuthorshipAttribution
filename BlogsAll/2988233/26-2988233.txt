Due to the depressing nature of my posts recently, her eis one to lighten the mood.  About a week ago, i decided to shower, shave, and just generally get all cleaned up.  I decided to give my ummm, lower region a trim.  In doing so, I nicked myself.  Evidently it was a decent nic, considering the blood that came from it.    So when I got out of the shower, I asked Tommy to check it out for me, of course my face was pink tinged, and so was his.  We may have been married for 15 years, but still, somethings are just personal.    He is down there, checking me out, looking for where I cut myself, and I notice he is doing a particularly good job at it, looking in this crevase, that nook, getting looking everywhere, not in a sexual way at all.  I make some comment about him really checking me out, his head pops up all of the sudden and he half yells, half whispers "YOU GOT SOMETHING DOWN HERE!!!!!!!!"  I about died laughing.  Told him to describe it, of course, I have a yeast infection due to being on antibiotics for my teeth.  He had no clue what that thick white stuff was, and was pretty freaked out about it.  ALl evening long, I would break out in a chuckle, then he would too.  The kids would look at us like we were crazy, and we would laugh harder.
