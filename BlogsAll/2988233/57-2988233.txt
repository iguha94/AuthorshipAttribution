We went to see Shrek 2 yesterday,a nd it was great.  My kids, all 5 of them, even the 14 year old who thinks he is grown loved it.  The shrek movies are even good movies for adults.  There were parts in it that were especially to make adults laugh, or just reminisce.  I really enjoyed it.    Before we went, my SIL calls and asks me if I am ready to walk out the door.  WEll, considering the fact I wasn't planning on leaving for another 45 minutes, I wasn't. She wanted me to bring the boys to CICI's pizza so she could buy them lunch.  I had just gotten out of the shower, and was putting my self tanning lotion on.  While talking to her, I forgot about the lotion.  I had put it on my legs, but not smoothed it out.  By the time the movie was over, I looked like a brown and white zebra.  except around the ankles, where I look like I haven't had a bath in months.  Did you know this stuff has to wear off?  This isn't a good thing.  TOmmy laughs every time he sees my legs.  I'm jsut glad I didn't wear shorts to the movie.    Ever get so filled with joy, you feel like crying?  I was that way yesterday.  I have no reason why, but I was.  Going to the store last night with son #3, he was jsut jabbering on  about the movie, and I looked at him, and almost cried, because I was so happy.
