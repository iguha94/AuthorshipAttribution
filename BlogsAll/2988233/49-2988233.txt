This is an post  that has been a long time coming for us.        This story is all about  my niece, Savannah.  She was born August 28, 2000, with a disease called Citrullinemia.  At the time she was the first and only living person in NC with this disease.  Now she is the oldest of 3 in this state.  Her parents are Stan and Renee Loftis, Stan is my sister Marlena's youngest son.  On May 6,1998, they had twin boys,   Zach and Luke , unfortunately  had this same disease, but it was unknown at the time.  Zach passed away on May 13, Luke on May 14.  It was a tough decision for Stan and Renee to have another child.  But with only a 25% chance of the child having the disease, they went ahead.  Prenatal testing told them midway thru pregnancy that Savannah did indeed have Citrullinemia.  But that didn't matter, they loved their unborn child no matter what and were willing to make the life sa! crifices to give her life, and love her for however long God let them.      They have been thru many ups and downs, more hospitalizations than you can count.  Savannah cannot have one bite of food, one sip of drink, without it being weighed and measured to the exact tenth of a gram.  They have a book listing protein counts in a lot of different foods.  If the food isn't listed, she can't have it.        Imagine being a child and not being able to eat an ice cream cone because the protein count is too high for your system.  Or not being able to eat a candy bar.  Going to a baseball game and not being able to taste a hot dog.  Savannah loves pizza, but can't have it.  She loves   peanut butter , but the special peanut butter her mom orders for her is $8.00 for a 16 oz jar.  Her all-time favorite I think is chocolate.  Did you know  one Hershey's kiss has .4 grams of protein.  When you are only allowed a total of 6 grams a day, you can't really afford to eat one Hershey's kiss.       Right now, Savannah will never be able to go to public school, or have children of her own.  This disease has total control of her life.  She has a portacath in her chest for easy access for lab work and IV meds which are often needed.  She has a stomach tube for the many feedings of special formula, and medication. Her main doctor is in Chapel Hill NC, her mom is on the phone almost on a daily basis either with the nurses, or doctors or nutrition specialist, you name it, they are conversing.  It is all a very stressful life.  Renee has to be "on" 24/7, she has had to educate herself on this disease, so she can educate the doctors around Savannah that don't have a clue what they are dealing with.  Simple things like going on vacation takes days to prepare the medicines, formulas, scales, foods, etc that have to g! o wherever Savannah goes.  They can't just decide to go spend the day at the park.  Every thing has to revolve around medication time tables.  every nuance about Savannah is watched, noted.  If she sleeps longer today than yesterday.  How many times has she stumbled today, has she played with anyone who is sick.  I don't know how many church services they have had to leave because someone there had a cold and that puts Savannah at risk.  A cold usually means a hospital stay.  A stomach virus could mean death.  This is not the life of a normal little girl. But she is still the most precious, lively, rambunctious, loving little girl you can ever meet.     The only cure for this disease is a liver transplant.  Next month, Savannah starts the work up for her liver transplant.  They found out last week that Renee is a match.  Her work up will begin as soon as possible after Savannah is cleared.        I am writing all of this to ask each of you to pray for them.  Stan only has one week of vacation left so Renee and Savannah are going to need a lot of support down in Chapel Hill.  All of us close to them are willing and ready to move there if we have too.  But we need you to pray.  This is a huge decision, and a huge life changing thing.  Please pray that God will see them thru this , and the outcome would be a healthy little girl, and a healthy mom to enjoy watching her daughter grow up.       Here is the link to   Savannah's page   I know Renee has put a  donation link on there.  It is going to take a lot of money for this to happen.  Her operation itself is covered by insurance, but insurance doesnt' cover motel bills,food,parking, gas for the 5 hour drive on way to the hospital from home,and sure doesn't cover the cost of Stan missing work to be with his wife and child.  I know anything anyone can donate will be much appreciated.  They are a one income family, with two children they are raising.  So Stan has to work no matter what is going on.        But please more than anything, pray, pray hard, and keep praying.
