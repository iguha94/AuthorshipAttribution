This morning, a lady called and asked if my two oldest could come do a little yard work for her.    They have worked for her before and she pays well, very well, so they jumped at the chance.    This time, she asked me to stay with them.  Ok, that was fine with me.  I had the two youngest with me, so we decided to pitch in and help.  Pulling weeds, spreading pine needles, just general yard grooming.  They also had to mow the lawn.  Not a big lawn, took about an hour with a self propelled push mower.  No biggie.  Nice lady, pays US, (me, and 4 sons ) $100.  So I decide that Tow oldest would get #5 a piece, with me and two youngest getting 10 each.  I included myself, mainly because I had to put gas in to get them there, stopped at McDonalds, to feed them on the way, AND bought them quart size gatorades to drink while working in the hot sun.  If you ask me, I got gyppped.  ANYHOW,,,,,,,,,  Tj tells me if he doesnt' get at least 45, he doesn't want any at all.  Well, guess what.  He didn't get 45, so he gave me the money back.  Said he didn't want it.    Now tell me, how smart was that????????   THEN, I have to go into town, he sends his money with me, with a list of video games he wants.  I meet Tommy in town, give him the money and list, and he takes Casey to the game store.  The games TJ wanted wre all at least $50, USED.  So, hubby didn't get TJ any game at all.  Hubby calls TJ from car and tells him, TJ PITCHED A FIT OVER THE PHONE.  This child is supposedly 14 yrs old.  He is pitching a red hot fit whining and crying because he didn't get a new video game.    Tell me again, he will grow out of it, He will mature and become a responsible adult, and I will enjoy being around him again..  As of bedtime, he was still pouting.  Must be nice.
