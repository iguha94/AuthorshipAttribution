Ok, I have been reading blogs today.  Over at   Tj's Place  Kev wrote about grown, adult men having a conversation naming their bodily excrements.  Fastforward 40 years and there sit my sons in Larry, Curly and Mitch's places at TJ's strip joint, naming those same excrements.  How do I know? They already name burps and farts (I hate that word, but couldn't think of a decent replacement).    I mean you know it is bad, when you are sitting in a ER cubicle, waiting for the nurse to come and set your son's arm, the door is closed, and all fo the sudden the most horrendous, excruciating loud sound comes from your oldest sons body.  So loud, that people come out of their cubicles to ask "what the *&$% was that?  So loud that the man pushing his wife, who is noticibly in pain exclaims "was that a bear".  ALl the while, sons 1 and 2 andthier favorite cousin are laughing their heads off, and mom has her bright crimson red head safely tucked as far behind the hospital bed as it will possibly go.  That burp by the way is the Barq's burp.  It was a result of drinking Barq's root beer.    (side note) that was over a year ago, when taking same son to ER again for a broken finger, same nurse, says "you look familiar" I mention burping "oh, yeah I know the HUGE burper, haven't heard one like that in my life"    Then I read my comments and surf on over to   Randy's blog , who, I have been reading for a couple of weeks now, and feel guilty.  Why, because I have made him feel guilty.  Oh what a tangled web we weave.    Who knew, when I first started blogging that this simple outlet for my emotions would evoke so many new ones!    I don't watch Soap Operas, my soaps are blogs.  Real life, real funnies, real problems.
