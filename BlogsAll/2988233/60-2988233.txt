I have a friend, T.  that I have been friends with for at least 15 yrs now.  At one point, for many many years, we were inseperable.  we even had babies together.  Her oldest and my youngest were born 6 days apart.  I have actually had people tell me they were jealous because we had such a close bond, such a close friendship.    A couple of years ago, the unthinkable happened, and some stuff pulled us apart.  It has been a very rough couple of years for her, really rough.  I don't know how many times I have fallen asleep praying for her, and hurting for her.    She called me a few minutes ago.  We had a good conversation.  She seems to be getting life straightened out, she is in a good church, and is trying to make her marriage better, and is even going to homeschool her daughter next year.    I am happy for her.  Very happy for her.  I have worried about her for so long, it is such a relief to hear her almost happy.  To hear her making such positive plans for the future.    I think we both have had to do a lot of changing lately.  A lot of growing.  It ahs been hard to do.  Life lessons are never easy, and the ones I have been getting haven't been a walk in the park.  I know the ones she has been getting haven't either.    But, for now, I have my friend back.  We probably won't ever have that bond like we used to, but I know God has something more for us.  A different kind of friendship.  We just have to wait and see what that friendship is.
