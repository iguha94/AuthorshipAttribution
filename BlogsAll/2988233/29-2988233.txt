I'm back, I forgot to post about American Idol.  I know one thing, they won't be good salsa singers!!!lol.  NO seriously, thsi wasn't the night for outstanding performances.  John Stevens has to go this week.  Just has too.  I know all the teeny bopper girls love him for some reason, but still, go on talent people, not on who is the cutest.  I mean think about it, John Stevens as the American Idol.  I just can't picture it.  Not even close.   I'm working on the Dublin Mudslide ice cream again.  See, I nurse my ben and Jerry's, I don't get it very often, so I spread it out over days at a time.  Just a bite or two a night.  Just enough to satisfy my craving for it.    Tommy isn't feeling well today.  He went off his blood pressure meds, and I  think it is catching up to him. We can't afford them right now, in a couple of weeks we can get it filled, but not right now.  I asked the doc for some samples, but he didn't ahve any.    I'm doing ok.  I have been trying to limit my computer time.  Mainly so I don't dwell on things too much.  I can get lost in reading blogs,and before I know it, it has been 2-3 hours since I sat down and started reading.  So I am really forcing myself to limit blog hopping.  I love reading blogs.  They are so addicting.  I had a funny story to tell about what happened last night to me and Tommy, but it is a little bit emarassing, so I promised I wouldn't tell anyone.  Not even blog it.  But it was hilarious at the time. One of those things that you keep chuckling aobut hours after it happens.  Maybe one day down the road...
