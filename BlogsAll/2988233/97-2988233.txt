I haven't played with all the new stuff Blogger has to play with, maybe I should explore a little! &nbsp;  I could get really, annoying with the color thingy, I love color!&nbsp; Especially in my blog!&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Ok, no more changes I promise.    &nbsp;  As you can tell, yesterday was a really special day for us.&nbsp; This is the first time two of my kids have gotten baptized at the same time.&nbsp; I was so&nbsp; emotional.&nbsp; Renee took the pics for me, I always forget my camera, or, in this case, the memory card was full on the digital, and the tape was full on the video camera.&nbsp; I am so on top of things.    &nbsp;  In a couple of weeks, we are having the benefit singing and dinner for Savannah.&nbsp; I have so many things I need to do to help Renee.&nbsp; I wish I could just read her mind and know automatically what she needs instead of her having to voice her needs so much.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I'm not one of those intuitive people who just know or just see what is needed.&nbsp; I have to be knocked up side the head with a hammer to know what to do.&nbsp; I love helping, and am perfectly honest when I tell you, "let&nbsp; me know if I can do anything".&nbsp; CALL ME, tell me, scream it at me, just let me know!    &nbsp; &nbsp;
