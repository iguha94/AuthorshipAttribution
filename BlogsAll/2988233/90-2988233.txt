I was going to write apost today about why I homeschool my kids.&nbsp; In fact, I did write the post, but decided not to publish it.&nbsp; I'm not sure why.  Instead this one is for Tommy.  Those of you that have been reading my blog for awhile know that we have had a rough several months.&nbsp; Very rough.&nbsp; It has been harder the past 6months, than our entire 16 years together.&nbsp; That's bad.&nbsp;   But I have to say, we have handled it pretty well.&nbsp; The thing that has helped us the most is dating again.&nbsp;  Dating again, has let us prove to each other how committed we are to this marriage.&nbsp; Every Tuesday night, we get Renee and Stan to babysit the boys, and we go out.&nbsp; It doesnt' matter where, or how long, as long as we are together, without the kids.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we became parents, we lost the couple, and became totally and completely involved with our children.&nbsp; Every second of every day was devoted to them.&nbsp; At least for me it was.&nbsp; I tended to neglect my husband, for taking care of my babies.&nbsp;   A few weeks ago, Tommy asked me if I thought Renee and Stan would trade one day a week with us, so both couples could have alone time.&nbsp; It was the best thing any of us could have done.&nbsp;   I've notice, we smile at each other more, I call him at work more to see how his day is going.&nbsp; We sit on the couch together watching TV, instead of being off in seperate rooms.&nbsp; Almost every night, we cuddle, talk about various things from the day, until we are both to tired to speak, and then just fall asleep.&nbsp; It is definitly the little things.&nbsp; The looks between the two of us, when the kids aren't watching us.&nbsp; The every so slight pat on the butt when we pass in the hallway.&nbsp; Coming back for one more kiss goodbye before leaving for work.&nbsp; Telling me I am beautiful, 16 years, 5 kids and many, many extra pounds after that first initial "hot" streak came alive.&nbsp;   I feel more in love with my husband than I was on the day I married him.&nbsp; I feel closer to him than I have ever felt.&nbsp; I miss him during the day while he is at work.&nbsp; I smell his shirts before laundering them, just to get a whiff of him.&nbsp;   That's what dating your husband does.&nbsp; It changes everything.
