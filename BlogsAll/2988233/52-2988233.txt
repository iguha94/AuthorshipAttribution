Ahhh, the joys of getting a good nights sleep.  Makes you not want to get out of bed!  My kids need the shrek 2 game for xbox.  They rented it this week,and I have got to listen to the 3 youngest laugh, giggle and snicker, while playing together.  I love those noises.  The two oldest hate it of course.  Casue if the youngest are playing it, then they know there is no way in the the world they are getting on the game to play their shoot em up bang bang games.  I like giggles much better than screams.    Tommy and I lay in bed a little while longer than  normal this morning listening to them play.  It was so cute.  The two youngest woke up first, and made a pact, "when Will wakes up, we have to get him in here"  Well, as soon as Will woke up, his two younger brothers were standing in the hall way "will come on, hurry we need you, we get to play the game"  Will jumpst straight out of bed and runs to the video game.  YOu could hear them getting all settled in and stuff, then the giggles came.  I love giggles.  Especially those innocent, first morning, not a care in the world, giggles.    Too bad, they will start puberty one day.  I better count the giggles while they last.
