LIterally, totally, I am aaaahahhhhhhhh.   My oldest is 14. He is very hormonal, almost 6 feet tall, and wieghs 240.  Big boy.  My neighbor girl is 16, long blonde hair to her waist, and well, let's just say she is blessed.  All of my boys have a crush on her.  Which is fine.  Until now.  Right now, she is sitting on my porch, watching my two oldest pass football.  She has been down here all day, and most of the week.  This morning is a bit different.  She is dressed up more than usual.  Nice tight shirt, nice jeans, hair fixed all pretty, with her best smile on.  AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH.  The boys cleaned their rooms, and asked if Nieghbor girl and her brother could come inside and play video games.  Being the cool mom that I am, I said sure.  She came in on my oldest's heels, and every where he went, she went.  Even going so far as to semi recline on the bed.  did I say AAAAAAHHHHHHHH??????????  Oldest decided he had enough video games, went outside, she was on his tail like a fly on fresh crap.  Laughing at his jokes, telling him how good he is at throwing football and playing basketball.  I know the signs, I was a 16 yr old girl once.    TJ keeps coming in and pumping his fist inthe air when she isn't looking.  He knows the signs too.  This would be his first girlfriend. ALthoughwe all know this will jsut be summer fling for her.    Im not against young love.  But I do know she is experienced, andhe isn't.  I think if you are going to play, you better be ready to pay.  AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH.
