Did you know pure peppermint oil is great for headaches?  It is, and really does wonders on toothaches too.  That's why I'm minty today!  I put peppermintoil on my head and neck to help with the pain.  TJ got his ego crushed today.  He was playing basketball with his brothers and cousin went up for a shot, and Casey blocked it.  IT just so happened that the nieghbor girl, Amber was walking by, and she laughed.  TJ has a huge crush on her, she is 16, built and cute.  TO a 14 yr old boy, that is the total package.   I had to stay with mom and dad last night.  Mom took her night time meds and didn't go straight to bed, fell asleep in her chair, and was sliding out of it, we couldn't get her awake.  So me andTommy went up and got her up, dressed and in the bed.  I stayed so if she got up during the night I could help her.  Poor Daddy, he was so worrried about her.  I don't blame him, she didn't wake up until arount 10 am.  She ahs been ok today though.  While I was at their house, NOah asked Tommy if he could still sleep with us until he was as big as Casey!  It was so sweet. Tommy told him he could sleep with us as long as he wants to.  I knwo that sometime in the next year, he will decided he is big and brave enough to venture out into his own bed.  So I will take what I can get now.
