TOmmy read my blog tonight. I had him reading another blog, to see what a friend of ours had written.  He read my post from the other day about wanting to have parts of my previous life back.  He was questioning some of the things I had written.  SO, I had to have a talk with him to explain some of the feelings I have been having.     When we first got together, we decided not to talk about our past.  It was past, so we decided to leave it there.  As a result, we don't know alot about each others old boyfriends/girlfriends, or previous relationships.  He knows a few of mine, and I know a few of his.  That's it. The only ones we have discussed are the ones that  made a impact on who we are today.  The insignificant ones were laid to rest a long time ago to never be exhumed again.  I guess the "motorcycle" post and the "not a virgin" part, bothered him.  I told him, I don't want those times back, just the person I was then, the girl who wasn't afraid to act on the spur of the moment.  The girl who loved taking risks within reason.  ( is there such a thing???)  The girl he fell in love with to be honest.    I told him I didn't like the person I had changed into.  HE seemed ok, once we discussed it.  Until the chest pains got worse, and he started having a tough time breathing.  Seems my post drove him to a panic attack.  Wow, the power I have.    Just call me ZENA THE WARRIOR PRINCESS!!!!!!  Seriously, I wouldnt be joking if he was in awful shape.  He even admitted that he needs to go back on his medicine.  The panic attacks are the main reason the doc prescribed them.  While on the meds, no panic attacks.  While off the meds, panic attacks.  Let's see, what would you do?  I would start taking my meds!
