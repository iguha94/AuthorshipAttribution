Sitting here, half naked, waiting for the Endless Summer to dry on my legs.  I am having a very vain day today.  Not really, but, more than usual.  I went and FINALLY got my hair done.  after 4 months of trying, I got it cut, colored and come home, conditioned it, and put the stuff on my legs.  For me, that is a vain day.  But the stuff  is old, so I may turn green.   sure hope not, that would be really hard to hide under panty hose tomorrow!  I am doing all of this to feel better about my self.  I walked to Marlena's today to get my hair done.  Which basically, is a 90degree uphill walk.  I was huffin and puffin when I got there, but I feel good.  So that helped a lot.  I am goign to hit the treadmill again starting Monday.  I keep forgetting to use it.  It is right smack in the middle of my living room, and I totally forget about it.  Can you say exercise avoidance?????  The boys new friends have been here all day long.  Seriously, all    day     long. I saw their mom at the grocery, right at that exact time, Casey calls my cell phone and tells me "those boys are here"  She is at the store, her kids are at my house??????? She had no clue.  They had been at my dad's house first.  Oh well.  I guess I have some new kids.  My house is like that, kids love to play here.  I don't mind, cause I am one of those over protective moms that won't let her kids out of her sight unless I know your complete medical, criminal, and spiritual background, followed by yo giving me collateral and a sworn statement that you WILL NOT hurt my child.  THen, I still prefer for them to be at home.  There are very few people I trust with my kids, my parents, Renee, Lori, and Tammy (not if her hubby is around, jsut her) and that is about it.  Casey has one coahc that I trust them wil.  But just the older kids.  It helps that I have a coupel of kids old enough to babysit now.  But for some reason, TJ thinks I should pay him for babysitting his brothers!  That's a joke.
