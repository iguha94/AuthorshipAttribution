I took my two youngest and EJ (savannah's brother) to run errands with me today.  YOu know, bank, store gas station, those kinds of things.    While driving down main street, it struck me, small time life just slapped me right up side the forehead.    Accross the street from the bank, in the Methodist church's parking lot, there was a tailgate farmer's market.  There couldn't have been 10 cars, trucks or booths set up.  SO we decided to stop and look at the wares people had set out.    One booth was pure, unadultrated honey.  Fresh out of the hive honey.  ANother booth had homemade yarn.  Hand dyed, home spun, the works.  Beside that lady was organic veggies.  Not some you go to the store and buy, not knowing where they were harvested from, these were harvested right in this lady's back yard, by her hands.  Some women were selling hand picked flower bunches, whie others were selling fresh preserves, strawberry, blackberry, even cranberry.  But the strangest one, was a mom and her daughter, the were selling doGnuts.  The girl about 9 years of age mixes, bakes and packages doggie doughnuts.  Three flavors, chicken, bacon and cheese.  I couldn't resist, 6 dognuts for $1, so I brought some home.    Back on main street kids out of school for the summer were riding bikes to the grocery store to get a cold drink, mom's with toddlers in strollers were trying to walk off that baby fat.  Two kids were standing on the sidewalk with a huge sign, "FREE KITTENS"  When we drove by, one of them held out an adorable grey and black striped kitten, put on their best pouty face, and yelled "PWWWWEEEESSSSEEEEEE".  I didn't cave.    We stopped at the local roadside produce stand, bought tomatos for 99/lb, and a homegrown cantelope.  I love good cold cantelope, one the front porch as the sun goes down.    When we got home, I was thankful for small town life.
