First off, the good news,  SAVANNAH IS A GO!!!!!!!!!!!   She should be on the list for a new liver within 2 weeks.&nbsp; She did great with all of her tests, they didn't have to sedate her like they thought they would have to, and all her results were good.&nbsp; So she is a go for the transplant.&nbsp; After she is on the registry, then the donor can start her testing.&nbsp; It is getting closer and closer.&nbsp; WHooooooooHooooooooo!!!!     &nbsp;  Last night, Noah ws absolutly adorable.&nbsp; He is six years old, but small for his age, so sometimes it is hard to remember he is as old as 6, he looks more like a four year old.&nbsp; But last night, he ws going around, asking me and his dad, "can we go to bed now"&nbsp; all night long.&nbsp; The boy was ready for bed the second that tooth came out of his head.&nbsp;   He was eating supper, and told me the tooth was stuck.&nbsp; Sure enough it was laying down flat.&nbsp; Tommy told him to pull it, of course, not ever losing a tooth before, he was scared.&nbsp; So Noah got dad some tissue, goes to dad with these huge, huge tears in&nbsp; his eyes, his bottom lip quivering, scared to death.&nbsp; Tommy grabs the tooth and gently pulls, of course it was about to fall out on its own, so it didn't hurt.&nbsp; Tommy shows the tooth to Noah and suddenly in the biggest voice that has ever come out of that little body  "welllllll, that didn't hurt?".&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Finally, Noah talks all of us into bed.&nbsp; Bedtime is noisy around here, there are 7 of us, so it takes awhile to get all the "night, I love you's" in, we are midway thru and Noah pops up,   "would ya'll hush and go to sleep, we all have to be asleep, she won't come, HUSH"&nbsp;   Of course we all ablige the little brat.&nbsp;    He snuggles up to mom, and whispers in my ear "  if we leave the window open will somebody break in?  "&nbsp; Then it dawns on me, he is worried about the tooth fairy getting in.&nbsp; "  Tj locked the door, how will she get in? " &nbsp; Awwwwww, moms heart breaks.&nbsp; "  The tooth fairy is like Santa, she has magic fairy dust that lets her get into people's houses  "&nbsp; I tell him, like a good mommy, lying to her baby.&nbsp;   "huh, Santa has fairy dust?"  &nbsp;&nbsp;   Yes, I have corrupted my son, lied like a dog, and ruined him forever.&nbsp; What are mommies for?   It is a mom's job to teach these lies to her kids.&nbsp; I know alot of people who think it is wrong, corupt even to teach kids about Santa, the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny.&nbsp; These things are all part of growing up.&nbsp; Kids have to deal with too much reality too soon these days, so I say let them have all the fantasy they can get while they are young.&nbsp;   Tonight is Poker Night, and I am needing it.&nbsp; Last night was one of those, don't mess with mom nights, I even broke my "no computer when Tommy is home" rule.&nbsp; I had too.&nbsp; I had one of those  feel the rage boiling up inside  nights.&nbsp; Not that I was angry, just didn't need to be messd with.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need chocolate, lots and lots of chocolate, mini M & M's to be exact, a bag of them,&nbsp; and a bag of Brach's Malted Milk Balls, Hershey's kisses would be good too.&nbsp; I feel a grocery run coming on.&nbsp; It is calling me, I can hear it.&nbsp;   Later, I'm gonna post about the Tour De France.&nbsp; I had one all written up, with links and everything last night, and it disappeared into la-la land.&nbsp;
