I have always lived in a small town.  I love living in a small town.    Tuesday night was date night.  Tommy and I decided to go into the city and walk around checking out all the eclectic ships and people.  Walking around, it made me wonder what it would be like to live downtown. To live on the 5th floor  of a building, with your neighbors just on the otherside of a wall.  To be able to sit in your living room, and watch the parades out the window.  What is it like to have to buzz people in to your home.    We walked around   this place  admiring the changes the owners made, in this former Federal building.  We window shopped at all the specialty shops.  What would it be like to have a shop for coffee, one for produce, one for cheese, meat, and one for candles?  I'm used to the all inclusive chain grocery store.    We walked down the cobblestone Wall Street.  With all its different cafe's.  One for sushi, one for Thai, authentic Italian, a Vegan cafe, a all organic cafe.  Each store front with a different motif.  Different old time look to it.  But so different on the inside.    The store dedicated to things from Ireland looked intriguing.  Tommy liked the store "A Far Away Place"  with all the home decor and clothing from India and the Middle East.    Dolce Vita  was my favorite.    Part of me would like living in the city.  But then I would yearn for space, wide, open, free to move about, scream, sing at the top of my lungs, space.
