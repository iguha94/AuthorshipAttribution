I have to blog this conversation between my husband, my oldest who is 14, my second oldest who is 12, and myself.  This happened about an hour ago.    #1 son-did you know mercenary is the favorite sex position?  mom-huh? do you mean missionary?  #1-oh, yeah, I just remembered it wrong.  kow what the secodn favorite is?  mom-not sure I want to-----  #1-doggies style  mom(while blushing, stirring supper hoping to avoid this conversation) do you even know what that means?  #1-well, yeah (with that teenage, I know it all look and tone of voice)  #2 (shouting from another room) I KNOW WHAT IT IS. I KNOW...  mom blushing even more now, stammers for words while #2 continues  #2-that's when you go at it from behind.  Mom- go at what?????  #2 making a baby  mom-how do you make a baby?  #2 proceeds to tell me, pretty accurately, so i go talk to hubby, and ask him how he has missed this conversation, he of course was watching the basktball game.  This lead to more conversation between #1 and dad  #1 didn't you think we knew how to make babies?  mom- well the chick on friends who is pregnant didnt' know  #1-yeah, well, I know what she was talking about tooo  Dad-ok, then since you are so smart, what is the thing you never do, and the thing you only do once in a while?  #1 without flinching, blushing or anything, tells us.    Dad- well you know women normally don't like that stuff.    #1- yeah I know, don't worry mom, I don't expect it.  By the way "padlock" was number 3 on the list.      Now, can someone please explain to ME what padlock is??????? How can he know this and I can't?????? By the way , hubby would like to know also!
