OVer on   Tj's blog , they are having a debate in his comments section about age differences.  Seems as if a 18 yr old boys is chasing a 14 yr old girl.    Who knows if it is right or wrong?  Now one does.  Depending on what country you are riased in, it can be perfectly normal for this age to be dating, even married.    But I have to say, when I was 14, there was no way on earth I was ready for the type of relationship that came with having a 18 yr old boyfriend.  I had the body, thougth I had the brains, but I didn't.    In fact, I wouldn't have know how to make my own decisions, how to say no to sex because I wasn't ready, I wouldn't have known how to stand up for myself, instead of being the guy's "woman".    Yea, I thought I was mature enough.  When I was 18, I was dating a 34 yr old.  I had NO CLUE what I was getting myself into. Only by having parents that prayed for me constantly, did I get out of that relationship with no physical scars, just a few emotional ones, and a deeper understanding of how NOT ready I was for an adult relationship.    That was at 18, I can't see a 14 yr old beign ready for an 18 yr old.
