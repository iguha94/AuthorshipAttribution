Something strange happened tonight.&nbsp;   It came from left field, and took me totally by surprise.&nbsp;   Tommy told me he likes my writing.&nbsp;   I don't really know why this shocked me so much, but it almost left me breathless.&nbsp; Knocked me for a loop actually.&nbsp;   It wasn't expected, or even wanted.&nbsp; But I like it.&nbsp;   For a long time, I have been a mom.&nbsp; Just a mom, completely a mom.&nbsp; Blogging has opened up parts of me I didn't know existed.&nbsp; Feelings I didn't know I had, thoughts I would&nbsp; never have dreamed of having, much less putting them down in black and white for others to read.&nbsp;   When a person, especially a woman, has children, they lose their identity.&nbsp; Whether by choice, or circumstance, you are no longer "Angi, college grad who loves to sing, read and go 4 wheelin', and once aspired to be a lawyer", you are "Tj's mom", "the mom with all the boys&nbsp;".&nbsp; I don't know how many times I have been introduced as that.&nbsp; That is fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a role, I take on with humility, because I am blessed enough to be someone's mom.&nbsp; I am a mother.&nbsp; It is what I was born to do.&nbsp; Honestly, it is.&nbsp; I am one of those natural, instinctive mothers.&nbsp; I can hear another woman's child cry, and tell you what is wrong with it.&nbsp; It is in my genes, to be a mother.&nbsp;   But sometimes, it is nice to be recognized as something else.&nbsp; Something not at all related to being a mom.&nbsp; Like my husband telling me he enjoys my writing.&nbsp;   Thanks honey.&nbsp; I needed that.&nbsp;
