the internet community amazes me.  Literally, totally, completely, utter amazement.    I have recieved so much response about Savannah.  I get tears in my eyes, reading posts others have made on THEIR blogs about her.    I just want to say thank you.  All of the posts have been so well written, and all for a little girl you haven't been blessed to meet.    Please, keep it up!  The more people who know her story, the better.  The more prayers and thoughts, and donations, the better.    Add her links to your pages, tell others about her, I know that as soon as they see her face, smiling at them, she will steal their hearts too.  That smile is what does it.    She wanted to ride in "gee's car'y" tonight, so I brought her home with me for a few minutes.  She walks in the door, and announces "PRIIIIIIZZZZZEEEEE" to my boys, and Tommy.  It tickled her to death to walk in my house and scream at them!  She loves surprising people.  When her mom comes to pick her up on Thursdays, she always runs and hides, normally with her head buried in my couch cushions, and then "prizes" Renee when she comes in the door.  That is if you can ignore the giggles coming up from the couch.  She is like an Ostrich, with her head buried, and her rear high in the air.  Giggling like a tickle-me-elmo, trying to cover it up.     Thank you again for all the support.  I know when Renee gets on the computer, she will be as amazed as I was.  I love my little community.
