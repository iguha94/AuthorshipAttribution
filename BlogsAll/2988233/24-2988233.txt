Well today is better, me and Tommyare talking again,and quite frankly we had sex last night.  It is amazing what a little mattress mambo will do for a relationship.  Put him in a good mood,and T in a good mood always put me in a good mood.  I have been reading other blogs alot lately.  It is really interesting to see who is thinking what, and what experiences they are having in life.  I read almost all of one womans blog last night,   Belle dejour .  She is a london call girl.  Man, what a life.  You know to her, it is so normal, so everyday.  And she still enjoys herself with her boyfriend.  I ya know what I mean.    Today I am paying bills.  Trying to keep things from being cut off (cable lights) and keep my backside out of jail.  (check fees from the messed up checking account)  So I will be all over the county and then some  today.    So much I canceled Will's OT appointment, due to a family emergency.  (hey, keeping me record clean and unblimished is a family emergency)  Too much driving to do to sit at OT for an hour doing nothing.  Tj is ticked off at his mama.  Oh well, what is new in the life of a 14 year old boy?  I asked him to do his chore for the day, shame on me, I should know that infringes on his rights as a teenager.
