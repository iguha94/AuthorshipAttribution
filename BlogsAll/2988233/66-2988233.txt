Tommy took the two oldest to EB to buy a new game for the Xbox.  My mom had given them some money for doing a bunch of chores for her, so it was new video game time.  They haven't had one since (gasp) CHRISTMAS..... for shame, for shame.  What awful parents we are for making them play the same old games for all that time.  They bought Gladdeous, whatever that is.    I watched American Idol.  I know some think I am crazy, but I enjoy Big Band night.  I liek the songs, they are straightforward songs.  They are a singers type of songs.  You can get into them, have fun with them, and just enjoy performing with them.    Latoya was great.  Diana did good, Fantasia did good on her second song, but not the first.  Tommy thought she stunk on both of them!lol.  My youngest is a cross between a yankee and a redneck.  Can there be such a mix?  In case you didn't know, I have a huge southern accent.  As redneck, hillbilly as they come.  Noah, somehow, got a bit of a northern accent going on, with a splash of hillbilly thrown in every once in a while.  He is my "yes, ma'am, No ma'am" child.  he says "yes" full sounds instead of yea, like my other boys.    Then again, he is his mom's son, someone told him he was a true redneck, and he replied, as horrified as he could "I ain't not a redneck!"
