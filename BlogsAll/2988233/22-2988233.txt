I am in a good mood.  Just wanted to throw that in here.  Good Mood, it has been a long time, with no depression, stress or any of the other things that bother me on a daily basis.  Cool.  The kids have been pretty good today with minimal bickering and fighting.  The great weather probably had something to do with it.  They played outside all day.    I am dying for some TGI Friday's onion rings.  I discovered them in the chips isle a couple of weeks ago at the grocery, and am totally addicted.  Them and Brach's Malted MIlk Balls.  unfrotunately, there is only one store in my whole county that carries the candy, and so far, only one that carries the chips.  Leave it to me to get addicted to something so hard to find.  T.  is in there playing the video game, he is trying to beat Tiger Woods golf.  He is at the next to last golfer, and it keeps kicking his butt.  Not good.  I would sit in there and watch, but get too cracked up at him when he gets sooooo mad at the game.  I mean he really takes it personal.  T shoots pool every Thurs.  at his boss' house.  He has only lost 3 times this year.  They are so serious about pool.  You should hear them, they even tried to get us (wives) to let them play on Christmas night.  Please... It is only a game.    N made me pinky promise him today.  Pinky promise, I havent' heard that one since grade school.  It was so cute.  J. has been running from the neighbor girl all day, "she want's to marry me mom, help"  W.  just informedme he is starving.  Too bad.  it is almost midnight.  C has been riding bikes all day, good thing too.  His heart hasnt' bothered him one time today.  TJ has actually been in a good mood today.  A rareity for him these days.  I willb e so glad when puberty subsides.  But then, there  are 4 more boys to go thru after him.  I could actually be dealing with 5 boys in puberty at the same time.  Oh please help me!Lol.
