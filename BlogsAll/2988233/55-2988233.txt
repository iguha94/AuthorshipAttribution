You will find, I never leave.    We haven't been on vacation since we married, 15 years ago.    Normally that doesn't bother me.  But sometimes, I yearn for a change of scenery.  To drive down roads I've never been.  To see sights my eyes don't recognize. To hear sounds that are new and unusual.  To find a spot, my spot, to sit, think and just be.    In my mind, that spot is on a beach, in a comfy chair, with my feet curled under me, holding my mug of cappichino, watching the sunset.  The breeze from the ocean is just enough to wisp my hair in my eyes, but I dont' care.  It is cool enough to have a sweater, but the mist hitting my face is a pleasure.    But that is not a vacation, that is serenity.    This is a different place than the place I have in my head by the lake.  This place is my escape for when the kids have been arguing all day, the phone has rung 20 times, with nothing but complaints, the laundry is piled up, the dishes are stinking in the sink, and I jsut don't have the energy to do anything about it.  The lake spot is for that.  For escaping from reality, sitting under a tree with a good book, listening to the nature around me.    The beach spot is my place for refuge, to be closer to God.  To sit and meditate and pray, and to be able to listen for that still small voice speaking to me.    Is this a need for vacation , or is this a need for quiet time with God.  I think the latter.
