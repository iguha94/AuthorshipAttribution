I jsut talked to the nicest bill collector.  And I know my bill collectors!lol.  I explained our situation, and he said he would call me back in about 3 weeks to see how we are doing and see if we can make payment arrangements then.  Now tell me, if they can do that, why on earth do they call every day just to hear the same story??????? I thanked him for being nice.  Today has been a good day.  Even though he had reason to be upset today, TOmmy has been in a good mood today.  I slept all afternoon.  Literally, I fell asleep on the couch watching the race, and slept until 4:30.  It was so nice.    Rusty Wallace won the race!  I am so glad.  I used to be a huge Rusty fan until I married Tommy and he converted me to the Earnhardt camp.  And on top of that, Junya, (Dale jr. ) is leading the points race!  WhooHooo, go Junya!!!!!!  Random thoughts from today:  Noah maybe almost 6, but today he discovered Veggie Tales.  He loved them and now wants a back pack and socks.  SOCKS????? lol.  TJ is one big huge ball of hormones.    My husband looks good in royal blue.    Don't eat mcdonalds when taking Glucophage, it messes with the digestive system.  (kind of gross) you can have dry heaves while having diherrea.    Dry heaves of any kind are painful  Drinking 3 tall glasses of sweet tea makes you pee alot.  I'm obsessed with bodily functions right now.lol.
