today wasnt a very good day... it all started when i woke up i could barely breath b/c my damn sinuses, they get worse everyday i need to hurry up and get my surgery done quick so i can say goodbye to all this allergy shit, its like having a constant year round head cold that wont go away no matter what you take! in biology i decided that i couldnt take it anymore and i snuck a few tylenol sinus and all they did was knock me on my ass and make me feel like i was going to pass out i was so tired, non drowsy my ass! in biology all we did was take notes then finished jurassic park, i figure this week will be an easy one since it is right before spring break, we shouldnt be starting anything new for a while yet.... in french we played "baseball" all it is, is a jeporady type thing but it was fun anyways, and i think we might playing the french card game where you have to reach 1000 miles before the other team, its a fun game if you know how to play it right, sometimes it does go a little to fast and easy but its all good. in computers we did in class notes which was very boring i turned on launch.com and listened to music while she was up there blabbering about some stupid shit...  at lunch nothing really happened, melissa liked my hair b/c it was soft and was all petting it, it was like a petting zoo or somehting lol it was kinda awkward but idc... in history all we did was our test and i got a c+ on it so that's pretty good, then we got this huge h/w assignment, i ended up w/ 4 pages front and back just for a damn section review! i hate that class! its like a damn sweat shop or something, he forces us to do shit all the time, it gets kinda boring! right now im talking to chad and courtney, god chad is such a sweetie! *kisses chad* courtney thinks im down in the dumps lately,  it kinda suprised me i was like huh? lol its just b/c that medicine today that just kinda slowed me down ALOT! lol well thats it for today!
