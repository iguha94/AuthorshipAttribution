well it looks like chad is going to be gone forever to me, he probably wont ever talk to me again, i kind of figured that would happen but i still had that little sliver of hope in the back of my mind but now its faded, i dont have any hope anymore it sucks... i talked to jeanne about the whole thing and i was about to start crying but i just kept holding it back because i know that if i would have she wouldve been right over here and i dont really want that... right now all i want to do is just curl up in my bed and fall asleep and never wake up again, that's the way i hope to die, if i have to go an alternate route, fine, at least it's still death right? wow i havent felt this bad in a long time not since last year, the hellacious year, it hurts alot to know that i fucked up the best thing going for me in my life, he was the only thing that i really looked forward to everyday but now all i have to look forward to is coming home sitting on my ass and feeling sorry for myself while the tv blares in the background... i found myself sitting in front of the tv for 4 hours today and just sitting there in a daze like i blocked everything out but what was going on in my head, i cant even remember what was said around me or what was on the tv, i was looking at the tv though i just sat there.... im such a wreck, i dont feel like talking about it anymore so fuck it....
