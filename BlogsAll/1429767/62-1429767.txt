wow, ok today was a really long day! in english i slept because i didnt know what to do and then in seminar i worked on math homework then in math we corrected stuff and asked questions and somehow we wiggled out of the 103 question review and we dont have to turn in our folders until tuesday which means i can still catch up on it all...  then in art all we did was watercolors and i ended up just sitting there and talked like i usually do and i didnt get anything done, i never do in that class i bet i end up getting a c or something in there but i dont care i just wanna get it all over with for once and not have to worry about it all.. that reminds me, i have to start on my sketchbook this week if i ever get enough time to squeze it in but i doubt i will. at drivers ed i talked to chris a little bit and he is pretty cool, im going to have him email me, dont worry chad he's not the type i would ever date believe me!  then we watched a movie and it was really really stupid like this lady looked like she was a vampire and i was like WOW! what the fuck is up with that? then i started laughing my ass off when the guy came on and he looked like he had a wig on lol bc it was all bouncing and shit. ok then... after driver's ed we were waiting for my mom and lindsay and lindsay from djack and chirs and curtis were all there and she's like he closed his eyes and talked 168 times! i was like omg thats insane lol we were all making fun of him (sherman the teach) it was 2 funny lol im pretty much exhausted b/c my mom wasnt done working yet so she took us back to the shop for like 2 hours so me and josh went out walking and ended up running most of the way then we got some md's and now i feel all fat lol so i guess thats it for now.... I LOVE YOU CHAD!
