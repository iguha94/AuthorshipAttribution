i went to see my grandpa today up in ann arbor, he is doing really well, it lightened my spirits to see that he was doing good first hand. he was being stubborn as always, he got tired of having a tube in his nose so he started to pull it out and pissed the nurse of but he didnt care, he just wants out of there. today he was still a little out of it, his voice is really low so its hard to hear him, he enjoyed the company of us... he is supposed to be out of the thoratic intesive care unit in a few days and into a regular room so then we can bring him cards and such, right now they are worried about germs so we had to suit up to go see him, thats the last thing he needs is a cold or some other illness, he is still a little bloated with water in one arm because thats where they have all of his iv's in at. today was the only day that no one stayed the night with him, only because everyone had work and couldnt take anymore off than what they already had. chris and paula are supposed to stay tomorrow night... well anyways now to talk about something else... one of the nurses there was SUPER cute he had a nice ass and a huge bulge i was like damn! and the good thing is that im going up there next weekend but i doubt i'll see him, he's supposed to be in a diff room i think... i heard that eric's mom got rid of the internet so that kind of sucks ill have to call him tomorrow and see how he's doing. keems might come over to djack on friday i think and hopefully eric comes with her so i can hang out w/ him or something... matt found out that i told jeanne and now he's pissed but really, i dont care i know why he does his shit that he does, he does it to get what he wants and to get attention, that is really immature i think, oh well at least i dont have to worry about him anymore... well i guess i better go, i should email karen about my grandpa so she can pass it on...
