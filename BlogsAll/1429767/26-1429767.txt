yesterday was a really bad day, i kept forgetting just about everything that was really important for me to remember, im such a dumbass! the day started off good, i woke up on time and all but i was extremely tired so i was just like sitting in class in a daze most of the time so i really didnt learn anything. and im thinking that i have a test friday in history but im not sure, i hope we dont because we took tons of notes and discussed the chapter yesterday and i dont remember anything from it. so im pretty much screwed if we have a test. today has been a little better so far, i didnt get my history project taped so im like screwed on that deal too, i think i might just have to perform it in front of the class which i will HATE to do, i hate public speaking! o well, courtney said that her mom told her that she should be able to have that hotel party, maybe eric could come or something, that would be cool, her birthday isnt until the last day of school so its a long ways yet before it can happen. thats going to be crazy to have the whole gang up there, i can see us now running through the hall and messing with each other... o its going to be great! lol i was just thinking that there has been a lot of drama around the school lately, first steve quinn's little sister died and lots of kids knew here at the highschool and mr comfort announced that he will be leaving the district after this year, i dont have him because im not in band but all of the band members say that the field show is going to suck now because he will be gone, and thats a shame because the field shows are awesome! o well hopefully there will be a good replacement so they wont suck. well thats it for this post....
