this weekend started out as a 2 day then monday school was cancelled and i had my doctor's appointment today... i found out that i have to have my nose totally rebuilt on the inside, i cant get any air through it at all so thats not good, he says that it is getting worse, i have to get a cat scan in 2 weeks to be sure if there is anything else that needs to be done when i have surgery that it gets done. i have surgery scheduled for june 21st so that way i can still go to the simple plan concert and all... chad really really pissed me off, he called courtney a cunt just because he tried to get him to talk to her since he wont talk to me or anyone else about what the fuck was going on, so its over i've definately had it with him, i dont care what he has to say now, you dont fuck with my friends like that and you certainly dont pull off the shit that he did and expect me to act like it didnt happen so fuck him, all i have to do is exchange necklaces with him and then i dont care if i ever talk to him again because what he did really hurt, i mean come on all he had to do was to call me and just tell me that he didnt want to go out with me, i never thought that it would take THAT much of a man to just do that, but i guess it does and he isnt man enough. what a jerk... i wont be so quick to judge people now becuase i have learned better, i was so quick to think he was cool but now i know that he isnt, that was probably all just a show to fuck with people o well i guess you're bound to run into jerks like that sometime or another...
