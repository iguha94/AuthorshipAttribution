Well I got to thinking down in this basement I know its scary when I think but what are you going to do about it? Anyway, I just need to move on because obviously Chad has so I will too I just need to stop feeling sorry for myself for all that crap that I did and forget about it, maybe find someone else if thats possible in this hellhole of a town. I guess that if im lucky ill find someone that I wont fuck things up with I think that as soon as I graduate high school im going to find a college REALLY far away from this place, this place is just too much for me sometimes, even with its tiny size and all. The people here are nice and all, most of them anyway, its just the few that arent that I cant deal with, like all the damn little cliques in school I hate it when there are a bunch of preppy people that think they are better than everyone else. I really hate the people that buy their kids brand fucking new cars for their first car and then say that their families are dirt poor, I mean come on I have this ghetto ass 1990 Bonneville that needs some desperate TLC and THEIR families are poor? Get a fucking clue people, you arent poor and you probably never will be Ok im done lashing out at people now, I do that a lot in case you havent noticed, im like that, I mean look what I did? Oh well its over now and I just have to try and move on I seem to be doing a lot better now today, last night I was really, close to just taking some pills and being done with it all, but I ended up scaring myself a little too much and not doing it obviously Well I need to go now, and dont worry Ill be fine from now on
