today i spent most of the day at josh's and when i came home i hooked my lil pc back up and started a good ol' game of monoply, i forgot how to play kind of for a second but after about 2 min it all came rushing back to me again which is good because the computer was starting to kill me damn lol im such a looser but thats ok b/c well yeah loosers rule! well i lost that game being the looser that i am so i decided to put the computer on super easy and the game lasted 3 hours, shows my skill, lol but i won it so its all good, it must be all the chemicals from the hair shit that i put in everyday... then after monopoly was over i started reading for english, i read this story about antartica and scientists on some ship that was exploring it, it actually seems like a really really beatiful place, the narrator was talking about how she came to have strange love for the place and once she was there and adjusted she had no desire to leave the barren land. so that made me think, yeah that is a nice lonely, beatiful place, no civilization, the only life other than your own being kelp, algae, whales, seals, fish, and penguins, just something about it makes me set a new goal for myself, somehow someday i want to visit antartica to see the vast lands of floes moving apart among the swells, water vapor from warm water coliding with the much colder air, wow that just seems really beatiful to be able to see the sun dogs at sunset/sunrise would just be amazing, i should look for pics of antartica, i know you say im crazy for wanting to visit there but i say im just different and you are boring because well it's true maybe idk lol im weird so deal with it! that story was really good, it had lots of descriptive words in it, thats what reading is all about, painting a picture with nothing but words and your imagination, its great stuff.... ok now onto the tv... i watched two and a half men, that is just a good show its funny along with raymond that show is great idk why, its just good mind rotting tv, something you dont run into often nowadays, it was a good break from reality and stupid parents.... well thats it for now because well im dull and i have nothing else to talk about...
