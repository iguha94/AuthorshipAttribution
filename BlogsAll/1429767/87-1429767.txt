im about to leave to go see my grandpa in paw paw its his birthday today and im going to help them open the pool so it can start warming up for the summer. it looks like chad doesnt want to talk to me or something really bad happened to him and im pretty much a wreck because of it all, if we break up which i hope we dont i think i'll be at least a little more at ease than what i am now because then at least i'll have closure. i thought that he was the one for me he was awesome but i guess that he wasnt, it hurts alot to not be able to talk to him and see whats going on thats all i need right now and i would feel alot better even if we didnt work out together *sighs* i got my concert tickets friday they are pretty cool looking i suppose i cant wait its going to be awesome and i have just 1 goal for that day, im going to meet simple plan and get their autographs no matter what it takes and im going to be really crazy looking so i can stand out in the croud, like maybe then i'll have completely blue hair which i hope to get the tips done this week if the hair dye comes in they are supposed to call me and set up an appointment, i might bleach it again this week too before i get it done because my roots are showing really bad and i might get it cut also since its a lil longer than i'd like it. well i guess i should get going now i sooo dont wanna have to spend time with my family today i hate them SOOOOO much! they are pissing me off being so loud and all arrgg o well who cares... i'll deal with them...
