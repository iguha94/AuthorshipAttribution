today was extremely boring all me and josh really did was do things for his parents which kinda tired me out... well at least i had a really good breakfast, its like a bed and breakfast over at josh's house lol last night was fun though, joe brought over his laptop and air panel and we were playing w/ that for a while outside along with all the adults sitting around the fire on the deck getting hammered and making some pretty funny jokes, joshs mom kept talking about how the mens bathroom has pubes everywhere because guys sit there and scratch the twins lol that was too funny... this morning i woke up semi early to eat breakfast then we left to go get some beef w/ josh's mom and then we came home and chilled for a while then worked out in the garage which wasnt bad at all then around 3 we had to go in the ghetto truck to go get some shit from the marshall moose which took us forever i just wanted to get out of that tiny ass truck but i lived so w/e... we went through kzoo i kept looking for chad but i didnt see him that wouldve been cool if i did, i might have even persuaded dale to let me get out and go with him! that would have rocked right there. nothing much has really been on my mind lately, ok well something has but i dont really wanna talk about it just yet, i need to figure things out before i talk about it so im just going to keep it in for right now so umm yeah thats it for tonight's post i think..
