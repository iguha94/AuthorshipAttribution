Today was science olympiad at it was pretty fun! i didnt place in any of my events (above 8th that is) i got one point for disease detectives and 3 for dynamic planet. it was a really fun time, we had these radios and there was this short lil kid on them from three rivers that i kept messing with, he kept calling me a gay fag or whatever i was like yeah i know, thanks for noticing, i must be doing something right today! that was too funny then he just kept calling me that even though he knew i didnt give a shit what he said, the kid was like 14 and shorter than melissa! that is soooo short! i talked to chad in student commons a few times it was fun melissa talked to him for a while too so thats cool.  i didnt get windows 2k3 yet today so that means probably tomorrow along with my new hard drive if ups is running on time itll be here around 930 thats pretty early for ups! the middle school got 3rd place overall and they ended up gonig to state so thats wicked awesome im going to have to go see mrs steil and talk to her about it and congratulate her and see whats been new with her.... i covered my back pack with duct tape on sunday so now it looks like a big piece of duct tape, it is like sooo awesome ppl asked me y i did it i just said because it needed some real style! i think it doesnt really look all that bad but i guess its all in personal opinion. i stayed at josh's last night and couldnt sleep so im really fucking exhasted well i better go, that homework isnt doing itself
