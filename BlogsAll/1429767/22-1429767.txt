Well whats up everyone? Not too much here. Yesterday me courtney melissa and michelle went to melissas and chilled for a while then leann came over and we just chilled for a lil while more then we went up to the coffee shop and left poor melissa at her house. at the coffe shop we ended up going to dollar general and michelle bought a tiara lol its her blingage! lol well then we went back played some cards got a lil caffeine buzz and had a fun old time. Exams are finally over and im thinking about telling josh this weekend about me being gay im really nervous about it but sara said she talked to him about it and then he said it wouldnt make a difference to him so i was like COOL lol... Well i guess i lied when i said that everything is ok eric has been having some problems with his ex and last i talked to him he was about to kill himself and i tried my best to talk him out of it and i talked to him later that day and he seemed much better but i havent heard from him in 2 days so im really really worried right now! idk what i would do w/o him because hes the first person that ive actually like and not just for his looks either, he is awesome! he was the first person i came out to and i know about his sexuality and all and this is the first guy ive known that i could actually have a chance with you know? well maybe you dont but if he goes i just might have to too... well i better call him and to everyone that reads this garbage: email me im bored! rohdy2006@hotmail.com! o and dont forget to check out melissa's live journal at http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=hoodratfairy
