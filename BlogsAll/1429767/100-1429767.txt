i cant believe that i have finally grown tired of all of my music... i cant believe it! you would think that if you have 1800+ songs you wouldnt get tired of them, well ya do, i hate to say it but ive grown tired of blink, yellowcard, limpbizkit, new found glory, linkin park, the rasmus, afi, default and w/e wow! I NEED NEW MUSIC! i get tired of listening to the same stuff over and over and over again. two bands that i havent gotten tired of yet though are simple plan and good charlotte because well you just cant get tired of them no matter how many times you listen to their music it just never gets old. since simple plan is my fav band i have to listen to their cd at least once every other day if not everyday, its just the best thing in the world and thats why i have promised myself to ALWAYS buy their stuff and not just accept a burnt cd from a friend, you have to support the band you love and well you all know i love simple plan which reminds me only 39 days left until the warped tour so that is going to be rocking my world and i have an idea for that since camping is only like 25 cents we should stay there overnight the night before courtney so we get good pit places, right up front so we can get noticed courtney that would rock and you know it would! it seems like im in a much better mood now and i know why, you do too steve ;) lol earlier i was frustrated and mad for some reason and i just felt like punching something until it broke, idk why i felt that way, i just did then like 20 min later i was sad again then i got mad and well now im happy and i know exactly why!
