today was another one of those days, maybe it's just because i'm back in school and to be honest i dont really feel like being there right now... in english today not much really happened we got a new seating chart and of course i dont sit by anyone to really talk to again, well amber is kind of close to me but we cant really talk that much, courtney is on the other side of the room again... *sighs* i guess i'll manage. In seminar we had to practice the MEAP's and it was really stupid i just basically blew it off, Josh kept making me laugh so i guess that's pretty much the hight point in my day. in math we got another seating chart and i sit at a table with caroline, amber, and jolynn so that's cool, so if i need help i have some people to help me at the table so i dont have to deal with the stupid teacher that hates me! o well.... i havent really had a chance to talk to anyone that much so im kinda down. in art today we got some new kids, they seem pretty cool for the most part, i seen someone i liked in there ;) so that's a good thing i suppose, i would much rather have sonny or that one freshman kid in there! they are both sooo cute lol well i better go im waiting for melissa to give me a call... i'll try and post later...
