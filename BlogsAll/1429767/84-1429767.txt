well today started off to be really really dull and i kept falling asleep in english then after lunch things started to get a little more exciting... we were in history doing this holocaust simulation and i was in the "shower" room for less than 5 minutes before i went in there the weather was fine just looked a little grey then i come out and its going insane with really strong winds and rain that kept blowing the windows open then the ceiling started leaking and things were getting REALLY REALLY bad outside, the power went out and then mr lehigh came around and said to get into your tornado positions after a while and things just kept getting worse, kids were trying to get a hold of someone outside of the school to find out what was going on and no one could get signal so everyone kept trying and trying then power came back for about 5 minutes then it went out again and finally people began to get through, at first everyone kept hearing over and over that there was a tornado in sister lakes and sarah began to cry because her dad and brother were supposed to be working outside on their house today and she was freaking out since she couldnt get a hold of either one for like a half an hour. then things began to clear up and kids filled the halls and we found out that there were trees down everywhere blocking the way to get to the school and that no city near us had power, everything was down... one kid's car got completely crushed by a tree in the student parking lot and the library hallway was flooded because of the shitty roofs on the school the water just came in like it didnt have anything to go through. eventually the buses got there and we all piled on them and my bus driver had just gotten back from a field trip with little kids and a big ass limb came through the side of the bus it didnt hurt anyone, it just broke out some windows so she still had the bus, it was soaking wet on the bus like all the seats were cold and wet, it just sucked, we then had to navigate our way through dowagiac with power lines down everywhere a long with trees, we eventually made it out of town so then when we went to drop taylor off we couldnt even get near to her house b/c there were about 5 trees in the way, so we had to make her walk then drive in reverse down the road so we could get back to the intersection to turn around. then we were going to head onto dillman street and the whole road was covered in limbs and trees so we had to go backwards once again to the intersection and turn around to go find another way eventually we made it to my house and my road looks like a damn warzone with a huge ass limb down that the road crews cant move, they had a bulldozer and a snowplow trying to break it off the rest of the way then they even cut it and they cant move it anymore so there is this HUGE tree limb hanging down into the road now with cones around it, i had to walk about 1/2 mile just to get home from the bus since she coudlnt go any farther on my street. luckily i didnt have any damage done in my yard and we still had power so i was happy, now more storms are on there way and wish me luck in keeping power...
