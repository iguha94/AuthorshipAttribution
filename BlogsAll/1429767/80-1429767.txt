ive come to the conclusion to slack off for the rest of the year except for when exams come i might study a bit, but im not going to do homework anymore, its just a big waste of time! and i have too much shit going on other than school so i dont really feel like doing anything. this shouldnt come to a big suprise or a suprise at all to you, i tend to do this every year its just this year im under different circumstances than previous years so as far as im concerned im basically done with school for the year... i wore my do nothing kings shirt again today and i really like it i think i want more, they are just so cool looking i think i like them alot! lol i need a blue one w/ the wings and black text now that would be awesome there, maybe it would match my hair! speaking of my hair it looks like it might have faded a little bit but not much so i hope it doesnt fade anymore because this stuff is just awesome and i dont wanna loose it! i need to start saving up for the simple plan concert because i think that we might stay in a hotel the night before or something and i have to pay for a room then i have to get at least one shirt. im thinking about finding some really good simple plan pics on ebay or something and buy them for autographs that i hope i will get a chance to get, ill wait in line all damn night if i have to, im GETTING THEIR AUTOGRAPHS! dammit and no one is going to stop me! im supposed to go camping with josh and joeseph with basically nothing but a tent and some hammocks, i dont think my mom will let me go for the whole weekend but she might just for one night at least i hope she will, she better or i'll be pissed but knowing her... *sighs* well im going to go get a yogurt becuase i just had the sudden urge for one lol
