i fall apart when i see you it's sad to say that i need you but i'm too afraid to admit that i've dreamed of kissing your lips and losing myself in your eyes my heart silently hurts and cries for you to know just how i feel for you to know that this is real...  but i freeze before you my dying love implores you to save me from myself sometimes i just need to be held and be reassured that i'll be ok and be reminded that you won't go away but when i'm alone i feel that i've got no one and i've got nowhere to go...  if i could be more positive and discover reasons to live i dno't want to get you into each of my confusing issues i want someone to understand that sometimes i do give a damn but no one around can relate cause their eyes focus on my hate...  but i freeze before you my dying love implores you to save me from myself sometimes i just need to be held and be reassured that i'll be ok and be reminded that you won't go away but when i'm alone i feel that i've got no one and i've got nowhere to go...  no matter how hard my life gets i still know what love represents and i find it inside of you but all this time you never knew that al of my problems get lost in the wind when yuo shake my hand and i feel yuor smooth skin if i could tell you but i wouldn't know where to begin...  i fall apart when i see you it' sad to say that i need you and i'm too afraid to admit that i also love you and i see that i need to believe in myself as much as yo do...  but i freeze before you my dying love implores you to save me from myself sometimes i just need to be held and be reassured that i'll be ok and be reminded that you won't go away but when i'm alone i feel that i've got no one and i've got nowhere to go but i freeze before you my dying love implores you to save me from myself before my heart becomes my hell assure me that i'll be ok remind me that you won't go away i don't want to be alone i want to have someone and to have somewhere to go...  i don't want to be alone I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE!!!
