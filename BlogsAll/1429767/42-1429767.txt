OMG good charlotte rocks! i love their cd it just got it out today and realized again how much they rock! on fuse saturday night they had celebrity tastemaker and good charlotte was on there OMG they are sooo hot! lol but chad is hotter i would say but they are really "not cool" as they put it they said that they are so not cool that they are cool, how ironic is that? they would be really fun to hang out with maybe i'll get lucky and win some sweepstakes or something so i can go on tour with them, now that would be a dream come true. today was actually an ok day, it was tiring because i had to ride the bus this morning but i got to sleep in biology since we are watching jurassic park b/c he forgot to fast foward to the dna part so he said o what the hell we'll just watch it all, so that was like kick ass! in french all we did was review since the test is on wednesday and friday, its going to be a tough one i think, i cant remember anything from this chapter, oops o well i'll do good probably..... o while you are reading this check out brian's blog hes pretty cool so just read it dammit or i'll kick you in your teeth at school because i know who most of you are! i think im going to sign up and talk to mr luthringer about that gay/bi/straight alliance thing, i think it would be a great thing to have, kids could come to it and we would promise not to tell who showed up if they didnt want us to, so that way kids would have a secure place to be themselves with other gay kids, and even straight kids could teach tolerance to the other straight kids in the school, it would show them how gay people are really no different than their sexual preferences, i hope that he would be willing to start something like that, start it out small only by word of mouth then spread it with posters and such after we get a good strong base of kids that are involved it would do the students and staff a lot of good for something like that... well thats it for now ...
