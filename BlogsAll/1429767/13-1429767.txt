HORRIBLE! in seminar i did nothing but work on math and then i had to go to the media center w/ all the other sophomores to listen to some lady from the college talk about crap, the lady had a HUGE ass and was creepy looking so i took my fingers and made a "v" on my mouth and licked it and mr luthringer saw lol he didnt do anything though... in math mrs lee was in a horrible mood she was yelling at everyone b/c they didnt understand how to do it. She was all like Y DIDNT YOU DO THE H/W?
