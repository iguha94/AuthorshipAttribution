fantasia WON! im sooo happy i love her style its awesome! i might actually buy her cd, i know that sound really gay, buying an american idol cd, but hey go figure am i right? i was getting very annoyed at the finale it just kept dragging on and on for 2 hours i was like omg just fucking announce the winner and do all that bullshit later! ughh stupid tv, im starting to become myself a little bit more i guess, i feel bad now about that email that i sent to chad because i was talking to josh today and he said that he had talked to chad and he said something like im one of nates friends so are you going to talk to me or w/e and he said well as long as you dont bitch me out... so that made me think that i was a little too harsh and that maybe courtney got a little bit too bitchy at him so im going to send him an email apologizing to him about that email i sent him, maybe he'll just want to be friends because he really is a cool guy and i probably wont ever have a chance with him but he's still cool to hang out with so maybe we could do that... i dont even want to go to school tomorrow since i missed tuesday i'll be behind in all my classes so that kind of sucks.... i guess it will be ok, we are having a "pizza" party in seminar for the seniors tomorrow so that's a day of nothing in there, i can just sit like i usually do and try and catch up on some sleep if i can... in math i have a test which im not ready for so i think i might go see my french teacher and ask her for help on it since she can teach it better than the damn math teacher, whom i hate in case you didnt notice already, what a bitch she is... well i guess thats it for now, wish me luck for making it through the day tomorrow!
