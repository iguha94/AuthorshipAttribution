today for the most part really wasnt that bad... at josh's we just chilled and went over to jordan's for a while to hook up a system for him then shot some pool for a bit.. when i got home me and the family went out to eat at wahoo's and i had a michiana burger, i ended up eating only a few bites of it and drank a glass of pepsi because i wasnt in the mood at all to eat and im still not in the mood to do anything really except crawl into bed alone like i always do and then never wake up... boy would that be nice! actually im in a suprisingly decent mood seeing how its valentines day and i couldnt talk to eric today... things are sort of looking up for me at the moment, but who knows, with me it could all go downhill before i even go to bed tonight... and "anonymus" why dont you just use your name i know who you are and honestly if you dont approve of me being gay or whatever then dont talk to me because really i dont need to worry about dealing with you too, i have enough on my plate right now... and if you say that homosexuality isnt natural then i guess i'll be un natural ill go to hell or whatever... i dont really care. im not going to change either so whatever you say to me or whatever you do to me it wont change a thing about my sexuality, its already too late to change anything about that, im pretty much secure with it and i have no doubt in my mind what so ever... so anyways... i found out the freshman i like name his name is justin, he's sooo cute plus he went to ozz fest so that is like wicked awesome (sorry i stole ur word melissa) lol melissa asked him when we were in mr brosnan's room for science olmpiad.. now i just need to build up the courage to talk to him sometime and maybe hang out with him... well thats all i can say for right now soo....
