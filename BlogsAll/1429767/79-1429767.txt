... to fuck eveything up.... i always do it... i finally read chads blog today again and he updated it and right now i feel like she because of what I've done to him, i shouldnt have been so quick to just think that he got mad at courtney for no real reason, i shouldve just waited until i knew more about the situation before i just went ahead and sent that shitty email to him... dammit i really hate how i ALWAYS mess things up whether it be everyday life or something really special i always manage to screw things up, whether i try to or not that's a different story... i really love chad despite whatever stupid shit i always do, i didnt want to make things worse for him with that email but i shouldve known that it would have but i didnt really think about it, i just went about doing my thing like i always do and didnt even stop to think one moment about it, i do it all to often i just do things without thinking and thats what makes me so damn stupid, stupid enough to fuck everything that i love up... i mean look at what i've done i never took any consideration to what chad was feeling and he is right, i was being really really shallow about the whole thing and finally i now understand what i've done to him... i will certainly understand that if he never wants to talk to me again, i wont bitch him out or anything all i want him to do is to read this post and know that im really really sorry for all of the shit that i've done so if you can forgive me then we'll talk, if you dont talk to me again i'll just know that you wont forgive me and i guess that if that's what you want to do then go ahead do it, it's up to you... i wrote this and was meaning to give it to chad today so i'll just post it on here.... there's more that i want to add so here it is... you arent the asshole jerk or whatever else courtney and i called you, i am and so is courtney for doing that. so accept my apology or dont i'll understand both ways...  *****************************************************************************************************  Well ok, I figured out that I REALLY fucked things up, I shouldve never just assumed that you just bitched Courtney out without reason, well I now know that you did have a damn good reason but I found out from her after I sent that bitchy email that she started on you first so, I dont blame you for doing that, I think I probably wouldve too, so Im really sorry about that and I was thinking the other day about that day we met and I just kept thinking about what went on that day and Im not sure but I think I know why you didnt want to call me back afterwards, I think that it was because I had all of those people there, to be honest I did invite some of them but I never anticipated on most of them showing up like they did, so, matt wasnt supposed to be there and I really dont even like him along with Kelsey Katie and Taylor but I like Katie and Taylor so I wasnt quite as annoyed as I was by the others anyways I do some really, really stupid things when Im around people like that, well I bet you already figured that out, so, I want to apologize for all of the stupid stuff I did which was just about everything. I know that I shouldnt have sent you that email I feel really bad for it now because I know you already have it hard enough right now and I shouldve gotten both sides of everything before I just blew up on you so Im REALLY sorry for that I know it was really shitty of me And Im sorry for all the stupid stuff I did that day and now that I've thought about everything a lot more, I think I might have things a little more clearer, I did the stupid shit so Im sorry for all of that. I definitely understand that if you never want to go out with me again I wont be crushed because I know that I messed it up. So if you still want to be friends even after I fucked all that stuff up, awesome, if you dont I understand your reasoning, I was an asshole and Im sorry for it all ok?
