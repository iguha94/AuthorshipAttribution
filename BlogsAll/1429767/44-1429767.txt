Today was a pretty easy day for me, we had a 2 hour delay so that put me in a better mood since i got some more sleep that i needed amazingly! when i got to school me and josh went and hung out with ms. brooks for a while then i when i was headed to go get my bag from the cafeteria i passed by the offices and mr. luthringer called me in there and said well i need to talk to you about something you wrote i was like what did i write? he showed me the meap practice writting test on his desk and i was like ooo that.... he asked how i was doing w/ the depression and stuff like that i was like umm fine i dont really have anything thats bothering me right now and he went on to say that other kids feel the same way and stuff like that he kept telling me to come talk to him if i need to and to not do anything stupid it was weird. it totally caught me off guard! so anyways me and courtney have been talking and she likes me and all and doesnt understand how i can be gay, its just something you know i cant explain it, its just like being straight you just know and she doesnt think that i could be 100% sure about it either well i am completely sure that i am gay, i have had those doubts a LONG time ago and i know now that im gay and nothing will change it.... anyways... when i got home today i talked to chad as usual and i was supposed to call him today but my damn nerves got the best of me i went to dial his number and ended up hanging up half way through dialing i was just too nervous i hate it when im like that, ill give it another go tomorrow, i should just do it and be done with it because i know im going to like talking to him so i should just dial and enjoy myself and forget about being nervous and all that. well i guess thats all i can post for right now, lately i havent had much to say so ummm yeah
