ive really fucked up now. i told the one that i loved that i dont deserve him. it sounded right when i said it but when i told him it was the worst feeling in the world he just emailed me back saying he could never forgive me for what i have done to him. so now it seems the only way out of this horrid hell that i live in is death, hopefully it comes soon though to end the suffering once and for all. i dont want to feel pain anymore i just want to be numbed of any feeling forever. not having to deal with any pain anymore. i cant do it i have to do it. why is it that i fuck EVERYTHING good in my life up? it is hell i tell you i am such a fucking idiot to have done that him i could have been with him i dont understand why i did it i love him and i always will but now he doesnt love me. i had to be a fucking retard and fuck everything up.   Perfect Story  Here I lay forgotton, body brittel & cold, all my thoughts of anger, race through a mind thats old...   Although I'm young at heart, my body feels ancient, now all my dreams seem to be so tainted...   Now my soul will follow, an unwritten theme, chasing lost images, that are never to be seen...   Running down a forgotten path, trying to find myself once more, getting lost in my past, only hoping that it wont last...   But my past is soon trapt, in the future to behold, now I have the perfect story...   NEVER TO BE TOLD...
