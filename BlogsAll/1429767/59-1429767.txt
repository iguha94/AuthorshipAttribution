i just finished my test in here finally it was really really easy we even got to use our html books which made it super simple... im really really hoping that i can get my sis to take me back 2 kzoo with her so i can meet chad and party she would probably do it for me so i think i will call her tonight and see what's going on and all... in english today we were acting out julius caesar, the stabbing part, and it was fucking hillarious like everyone that was up  there didnt really act all that well and when kim said o caesar it sounded like she was trying to seduce kristen lol it was just too funny.... i read chads blog a just a lil bit ago and it was really really sweet he is such a sweetheart he is an awesome guy no matter what happens ill always think that! *kisses* i love you babe! i cant wait until tonight he is supposed to call me i think or im supposed to call him im not so sure so umm yeah ill get to talk to him either way which makes me really really happy! *hugs chad* im always really happy when im talking to him like i cant stop smiling when i talk to him either online or on the phone and when i read his blog i smiled even more for like the whole rest of the hour and i probably wont stop for a long time to come yet. well that's it for right now ill post more like later 2 night....
