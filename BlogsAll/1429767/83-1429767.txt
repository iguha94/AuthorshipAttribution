the storms are still coming one after another, its getting quite annoying! yesterday was enough cass wont even have power unitl around wednesday so it sucks to be them and hopefully i dont loose power because i would have to wait even longer than cass does. it looks like the highschool has power back now so that means school will be in session on monday *sighs* o well this is our last full week of that hellhole for 3 months so i should be happy but im not really... im going to miss all of my friends like last summer since i cant drive yet w/o my mom or dad so that pretty much blows monkey balls... i got back from the relay for life a little bit ago and it was kind of boring i wanted to stay kinda didnt because jake's band is playing tonight from 1-2 and 3-4 so that wouldve been something to see... monday im just going to get all of my hair done in blue i want it that way so i can stand out a little more because standing out is awesome, its fun to be different, because normal people suck! lol taste my RAINBOW MANDY! lol i just had to say it, i have a feeling that i wont sleep tonight since im not tired at all, i might just go mow the damn lawn, its not like the mower doesnt have headlights on it so i think i might do that after i get offline just for something to do, i started it yesterday and now i only have a little bit left to go so i probably will finish it tonight... the county tried to get that limb out of the street again today but they cant, they had a plow and bulldozer there again and could do it so idk what they are going to do, its still hooked up to the three and being held up by like 2 others so its "tangled" up pretty good, i think im going to steal a traffic cone from there, they are all reflective and stuff! well thats it for now ....
