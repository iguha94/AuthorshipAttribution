Today i didnt have school! yay! i dont really know why we had one though, we didn't get the 4-6 inches or w/e last night, but today i heard we are going to get up to 6-10" with severe blowing and drifting, so far today it doesnt look like we'll get all that much, its a light snow now, enough to lower driving visibilty and its extremeley cold, only 8 by the thermomiter on the tree outside, but that thing is ghetto so it's probably off by quite a bit. so far today my day has gone good, im not too depressed today, im just more neutral right now, kind of bored... i watched open range today it's a pretty good western, im usually a fan of westerns but this one was exceptionally (ooo big words, watch out!) good. it was kind of hard to get into at first but as it went on you'll get into it a little bit more. i talked to josh today he's not up to much so i might end up swinging by his house if i can get a ride and just chill over there for a while or w/e. hopefully we dont have school tomorrow either, i hate friday schedules, they are too hectic for me, plus you have to take all of your books with you pretty much... well i suppose i better go my mom needs the phone so i'll more than likely post tonight sometime.... im going to write a few poems today too so ill post them definately....
