this week has sucked big time and im still not out of the woods with it all yet, its making my go insane with how much shit i gotta do, i got my french project today and its going to take me forever to do that, we have to have all kinds of shit, way too much for me to handle.... i sent chad an email hopefully he'll reply i think hes avoiding me, but then who wouldnt right? sorry im just in a really bad mood right now its not even all about chad either, im so so fucking stressed out its gotten me to the point where im crying i have too much to do in a very very small amount of time and its not fun to think about... *sighs* life really really sucks right now ive got way too much on my plate to deal with right now... maybe its a good idea to take advantage of mr luthringer's offer and go talk to him about things maybe ill feel a little bit better, thats what he's there for so i guess it could do me some good to talk to him about everything, i dont think ill tell him about chad though b/c then he would call my mom i bet but i might still say something just i wont mention his age, he is a lil old for me but if hes willing to go out with me im already his but thats all up to him i guess.... i hope i didnt do anything to fuck this one up, i seem to be really good at it now adays, i fuck everything up really o well i guess thats just me... i read and saved some bolt poems today and that didnt help me at all with my mood so i guess ill just sleep the whole weekend and end up waking up and being brought to tears because i didnt get any of my shit done that i was supposed to. so i guess thats it for now wish me luck w/ life.....
