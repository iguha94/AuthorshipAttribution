hey everyone hows it hangin 2day? im in a bad mood today... first of all josh got voted off of amercian idol last week and i miss him so much its like loosing a friend, it tears you up inside well i know that he'll move on to better things and all its still a heartbreaker especially when he brought his little girl brianne up on stage and started to sing to her it was awesome... "I want my life to be.. yeah.. to be with you to live with you..." that line right there makes me cry everytime i hear the song "You dont know what its like.. Baby you dont konw what its like.. To love somebody to love somebody!" that was also awesome! Check out this    site its for josh if you like him (cmon u know you do)  . Josh has been on TV alot lately and he has been singing on alot of the shows he did like on regis he sang "I'm Already There" by Lonestar you should listen to his version of it sometime its an awesome song even though i dont like country i love all his songs which are all country so im sure ull like it.. Second, i hate my family. my mom hates me because i dont do pot like all the rest of my family its embarassing really to know that youre the only one in your family that doesnt smoke pot and be hated because of it! my mom treats me like shit all the time she doesnt even listen to a word i say to her she focuses her attetion to my brother who is a partier. for all she cares i could be in the corner slitting my wrists (which i have done before) while she is praising my brother for being a pothead, no is that wrong or what? it just drives crazy! it makes me want to just yell out "you fucking pothead why dont you pay attetion to your son while he kills himself instead of praising your pot head son!" i cant take it anymore! i should just stop writting this shit coz nobody reads it well that i know of...
