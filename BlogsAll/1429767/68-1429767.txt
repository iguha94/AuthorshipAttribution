i was just thinking before i went to bed tonight why i love chad so much... he was the first person that ever really cared about me the way he does he is the first person that i could ever say that i love you and actually mean something more than a friend or family member. he is my first true love he is everything to me, he is incredibly sweet and his personality is all around awesome he loves me back and i think its the first time that ive been able to say the feeling of love was mutual with another guy, eric was just a dick he didnt love me he was just some shallow ass jerkoff that wanted sex, he would rather screw some guy out on the street then be in a long term relationship so i say he can go fuck off and if he calls my house i will tell him that, now that i look back on it all i dont see how i could be so STUPID! i was supposedly in love with him but then i realized how much of a jerk he was and gave up but i dont think that'll happen with chad, in fact i know it wont because ive thought and thought and even thought some more about it all and i realized that i will always love chad way more than i ever have loved anyone before and this time not talking to him has really made me feel like shit but its ok i know hes been sick and stuff so i can wait but ive never felt the need to talk to someone more. its like a whole new feeling inside of me, i feel great to be able to say it and mean it: I love you chad. right now i think this is the greatest time in my life so far so heres to you chad i will always love you and never forget that whenever you are feeling sick or down just remember that i love you and tough it out i dont know what i would do without you. you are the greatest person i have ever "met" and i really mean that im not just making it up, you mean far more to me than you or i'll ever know there is just something about you that makes me feel really good. you always make me feel good about myself when i talk to you, you can make me laugh, cry, or whatever, and for that, chad, i love you....
