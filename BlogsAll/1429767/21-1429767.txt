Hey everyone. Today I just pretty much and sat around enjoyed the sunday, i actually cleaned the basement today! yay go me! so pretty much my day was uneventful... I came out to Matt yesterday, he took it kind of bad at first but now he's ok with it all so im happy! Right now im just talking to matt, eric, and patrick, they are pretty much making me laugh until i can't breathe anymore, they are crazy, eric thinks we should have a 3 some w/ matt *ponders* that wouldn't be so bad now would it?lol its too much fun to mess w/ str8 people, but you have to watch yourself, because you could mess w/ the wrong person you're in a world of shit. things right now are going so good for me because of all of my friends, so some advice dont piss your friends off or hate them or w/e else would make them mad because you'll never know when you'll need them, they can be the greatest thing, hell screw god, I GOT FRIENDS they care about me and I care about them so it's all i need, love isnt even an issue for me anymore, im happy being single surrounded by friends, they can make you laugh and cry and bring you out of the dumps, what else could you need? well sure, you cant have sex w/ them but you dont need sex all the time! even if you are horny you dont need sex! o and i think im bleaching my hair then putting in blue highlights, its going to be wicked awesome as melissa would say! well im going to go and well i might post later before i go to bed which should be in a few hours or so...
