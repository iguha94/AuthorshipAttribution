today went pretty well, nothing much happened really, i was just glad to be back at school for once so i could talk to all of my friends. things get pretty boring around here when we have snowdays. speaking of which its supposed to be bad again tonight so maybe we'll have a delay or something so that way i can catch up on some sleep, i didnt go to bed till about 2 last night... well anyways, in english we just sat there and listened to her talk about stupid stories that no one even read so it was just a waste of Mrs. Frantz's time but its all good right? in seminar i had and ETS meeting so i went to that and just screwed around, but we are going on a field trip to the college for a "survivor" thingy, sounds really dumb but, hey at least i get out of school! after the meeting i just headed back to seminar and worked on my math homework... in math mrs. hargreaves-lee was in a bad mood she yelled at us to shut up so maybe we would learn something, yeah right, us learn anything? nahh screw that! we're from dowagiac remember mrs lee? in art all i did was just drew on my GTO pic and josh smiley drew some of it for me because for the life of me i couldnt get the front fender to look right, but it looks great now! i had to stay after for science olympiad and we were launching bricks at the tennis court and launched some tennis balls down the hall w/ a catapult, it was pretty fun. i have to work on my presentations for it, i have to describe my events and what i have, so far, done to prepare for them. i have disease detectives w/ leeann and dynamic planet w/ jake so thats pretty cool, i should look some stuff up for the detective one so that way im a little prepared for it and maybe i'll place in an event this year! yay go me! lol well that's it for today....
