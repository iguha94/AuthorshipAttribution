i had to get all early this morning, about 6 lol.. o well i had fun last night talking to some people so it was ok i suppose... it was a rough day at worrk, i smell like a dog now, stupid dogs! rrrggg they make me mad! i bought the bleaching kit for my hair today it was only like 10 bucks so that was awesome! im thinking about just letting my mom do it but im not sure how good it would come out. shes making me use the fake gel stuff that you use for like halloween and stuff so that way she said i wouldnt regret the blue or w/e i would much rather just dye it in and then see how it would look but idk ill just do what she says... so i think im going to find a way to post a pic on here, i think i might be able to just insert it as a html tag and it would work but im not sure yet... ill have to try it. last night i was talking to a bunch of people in a chat room, i think eric justin josh melissa keems and matt were the only ones i really talked to. eric said that he might come see me when i was working but he didnt, but thats ok i still thinks hes awesome anyways! lol im still debating the whole hair thing, so if you have an opinion as to weather or not i should bleach it email me or something...  My email addy!  well thats it for this post, ill post later after i do my hair, if i do it that is...
