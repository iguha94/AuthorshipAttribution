omg i have never seen so many lady bugs before in my life! i woke up on saturday (josh stayed the night on fri) and they were up in my windows b/c i had it open and they started to swarm me so i hid under the covers and went back to sleep lol, 10 is too early for me! when i got up tho i had to slip my clothes under the covers so i wouldnt get all fucked up by them. after me and josh got moving and had showers we went outside to see what my dad was up to and to clean out the shop vac since it was full of water and all kinds of nasty shit from the basement hotwater heater incident and we ended up tearing down the fort thing attached to the swing set which was really that hard it was pretty rotten so we could just push on it basically and it would fall apart then we piled it and burned it in the fire pit and used some kerosene to start it, it was a pretty damn hot fire! then around five we went and got some good ol' taco hell and went on over to his house and chilled watching mtv and fuse till about 230 in the morning, his mom and dad came home and asked why we were still up, josh said i was eating a salad lol it was funny for some reason so then we went downstairs and talked then went to bed and then in the morning his mom made some breakfast which was good because i felt like i had been hit with a train and it felt good to get some oj and real food in me. then i went home and i was here for about an hour and we took off to paw paw to go see my grandpa, he's still in a lot of pain and is really depressed about the whole thing but he's slowly getting better and better, he'll never be the same again though and that kind of makes me sad, he used to have a great time in the pool w/ all of us kids and stuff but now i doubt he'll even get into the pool this year but i guess it wont be all that bad there's always next year. when i got home i bleached my hair again and its really almost white now, it looks wicked awesome! i was thinking last night that i might go in and talk to mr luthringer about fitting in and stuff like that, i was thinking that yeah i have my group of friends and they are freaking awesome but i dont fee like i fit in very well at all just because im gay and all, so im going to see if he would like start a gay group or something up were gay kids can meet with others and talk after school or something it would rock! well thats it for now!
