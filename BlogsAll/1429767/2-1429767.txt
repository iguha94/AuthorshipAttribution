My Belief In God  Is there really a god, someone to watch over us and to guide through the night when we need it most? Or is it all just some mass misunderstanding? Mayber there is, whom which doesn't help me or at least I dont feel that he does like some others claim. Some say that Jesus has helped them in one way or another but he certainly hasn't me, I'll pray and pray until I can't pray anymore and what do I get? Nothing at all, it's not like im asking him for a million dollars or something but it's just little things and stuff like that yet he never sends me a sign or some how makes me believe that there is some one watching over me helping me through the rough places in my life. For example, I prayed every single night for Josh Gracin to either win or to at least be in the top three even so he could get a recording contract, and what happened? He got voted out almost like there was no god guiding him through it all. Weeks before I prayed for him (right around the time he was in the bottom two for the first time) and he did horrible the week following so I prayed extra hard and he wasn't in the bottom two, then the week he left AI2 he sang like an angel, just what I had prayed for. Then I prayed for him to stay and now he's gone. Maybe those first two positive turnouts were a sign for me, which I did not acknowledge. All that I ask is he just send me a sign or something telling me that he does exist and that he is willing to forgive my sins and help me get through this oh so rough time that I am experiencing right now. I'm not saying that I hate him or anything just that I will not choose to worship him faithfully or pray to him every single night until somehow I get a sign that he loves me and that he is there for me for every walk of life. I guess all that I can do is look to the heavens and hope that someday I will meet the all so mighty one if he does truly exist...
