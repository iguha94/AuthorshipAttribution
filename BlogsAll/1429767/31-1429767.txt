im just sitting in computers right now, im supposed to be studying for a test but im not really worried about it, i should do fine as long as i can type for the moment... ive had a good day so far, im sure it'll go bad before its over... i made a list of guys i liked today in french, it wasnt very big, i couldnt remember all of them so it was only just about a page long (front only). i havent cried in a while which is suprising, maybe because im not as worried about my grandpa at the moment. he is in a regular room now so im not worried about him anymore i dont think anyway.. i should be working on science olympiad stuff after school everyday but now i just dont really care about it anymore, if i do bad in my events then so be it! i dont really know what to talk about on here since much really hasnt happened lately... ooo i have three tests today, biology, history and computers so ummm yeah..... i made a french valentine's day card today in french lol it was really stupid, i should make one for eric lol it would be really cheasy lol... it would probably scare him... too bad he couldnt read it i bet... i already used my allowance on my itunes account so that makes me kind of mad so i have to wait until i win a free one or something.... well i guess i better go, maybe i'll paste some more on this site later... omg it really stinks in here i dont know why! o well....
