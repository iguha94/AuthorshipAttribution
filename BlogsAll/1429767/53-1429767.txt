Well everyone i actually met someone thats worthwhile and actually live around here! he is wicked awesome! hes from st. joe, hes in a band and hes soooo sweet lol im all obsessive sounding but thats alright maybe someday we could hook up or something! well today i called western digital because it sounds like my drive burned out another bearing and ive only had the damn thing just a lil over a day so they told me that my new one would be here in 3-5 business days and i wont have to pay to ship the old one back since they are sending me a ups sticker thats prepaid so i just have to drop it off at a ups place thingy. today was actually a really good day for me! in biology me and michelle just talked and did our DNA models that was pretty fun she lives in town now so maybe should walk up w/ all of us sometime. in french we played jeporady and our team ended up coming back from -1000 points to 450 i think so we sucked! lol but it's all good we had a good laugh, freshmen somtimes can be mature and laugh at the right time and it so turns out that they did today in french. in computers i was like swamped but i manged some time to talk to chad and im glad i did he pretty much made my day, hes so freaking awesome! in history we took some notes and discussed a quiz that we took, it was quite boring and i had chad on my mind lol well i guess thats it for today my back is killing me and my fingers are kind of stiff so ummm yeah.....
