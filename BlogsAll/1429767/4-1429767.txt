i fucking hate this world no one seems to like me everyone i ever meet just pushes me away. the person that i love hates gays just the other day he told me he wanted tourture every single one of them.  no one seems to understand me for who i really am, no one loves me therefore i can never express true love, im ugly, im a classic nerd, im gay, im chubby, and im fucking depressed. my friend ian is the only one who understands me simply because he is gay himself and has dealt with all this himself in the past but how can i find comfort in him he lives in la. you know i watched this movie called good girl it was good movie, a nice depressing one. its about this girl who cheats on her husband and tries to make everything normal again, but ends up screwing it all up in the end kind of anyway really. it relates to me so much because every friendship that i have i end up screwing it all up. i hate my life so much the world is hell, you know how people say that there is hell on earth well there is no such thing because earth is hell its a horrible place there is no good on the planet, well at least i cant seem to find any, my parents hate me so that rules them out... ian maybe the only good on this world he understands me, i love him but yet i know that he doesnt love me because im too young for him and he probably thinks that im an ugly bastard like everyone else that thinks that it is funny to pic on me just because of it. you know i cant handle this anymore its all eating me alive anymore its horrible i cant live a true life all i want to be is cute, in shape, and find someone to love that isnt a complete asshole. you know what i mean? its horrible how one can go through life and never experience love before because that is how im going to be for i dont know how much longer i can live through this....
