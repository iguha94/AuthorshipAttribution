hmmm well today went pretty good for me for the most part. i had a long talk with jeanne today about someone and i really cant say who, so ill just leave it at this: im no longer worried about someone b/c i know how they really are... well anyways i have good news, my mom called from ann arbor today to say that my grandpa's surgery went great, but they cant see him until seven so they will call once they get into see him. he had a large annurism (spell?) in his aorta he had to go up to the university of michigan becasue no one around here wanted to touch it but everything is gonna be ok now so im not all worried anymore... my parents should be back around midnight or so, so thats another night w/o them lol nothing much really happened today, i told alysia about my sexuality she was suprised but she's cool with it and all... im thinking about telling amber one day soon so that way i dont have to worry about it at all anymore.. that'll be nice! i have homework again of course, i have history, english, and french to do so im pretty much loaded down with it at the moment but im not too worried about it, ive been lazy as of late....  melissa showed me who she likes today, john comstock, he doesnt look all that bad, i think sonny looks better though, sonny has beautiful eyes, i should get a pic sometime and show you! well thats it for today i think....
