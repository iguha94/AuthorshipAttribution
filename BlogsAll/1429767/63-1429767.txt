today went ok until i read my email in 5th hour (computers) today. i was happy and about to cry at the same time. first i was happy that i finally heard something back from chad but what i heard wasn't very good.... he lost his job and is in a really shitty mood he was scared to tell me about it but i want him to know that he doesnt ever have to be scared to tell me ANYTHING im here to listen and help the best i can so if you read this chad, dont ever be afraid to tell me something no matter how bad it is, just tell me and i can help you out with it all, dont call yourself a loser or feel like one, because you're not by any means, you are my babe and you always will be. it was just a job i know its going to be extremely hard to get by but just tough it out, you'll find a job you just gotta work really hard at it no matter how shitty you feel, and if you get turned down by a job then just move on, dont quit looking until you found one. i found that one out the hard way, i was looking for love, gave up and felt shitty, then i found you and now i feel great about myself. so dont ever give up no matter how hard it may seem ok? i love you baby *kisses* never forget that!... in drivers ed all we did was listen to sherman talk and talk and talk some more... chris was laughing his ass off for some reason today maybe b/c i was making fun of most of the stuff sherman said i was being stupid really, it wasnt all that funny but hey i had a good time so maybe tomorrow wont be so bad... i got some more of my math homework done tonight but i only got a worksheet done so there's tons more left but im almost out of the woods for this chapter *screams* and once the test is done ill feel like a new man!
