OMG today was like the worst day ever! i am in homework way past my head, i have 5 scetchbook drawings left, a shit load of math and biology to do not to mention i still have to write my short story i think im going to go insane with all this homework! in seminar i asked mrs hargreaves to show me the homework that i dont do and slammed my folder down on the desk and she said no, i dont feel the need to show you.. i said you are sooo stupid and turned around and walked out. then of course i have her 7th hour so i had to sit in there right after seminar while she glared at me, o well she ended up leaving about half way through the hour... i think my mom will cuss her out once she gets a hold of her. that will be sooo funny if she does that! my hard drive hasnt come yet, neither has windows 2k3 but i think my hard drive will come later hopefully b/c i need to get this other one sent out before the label expires on it. omg i am soooo fucking stressed its not funny today i felt like crying in math and its just going to get worse i know it is but i guess ill have to learn to deal with it dammit i cant believe i have all of this shit to do by friday! right now i just need to get away from it all and relax for a while without all of that damn homework hanging over my head its driving me insane but i dont wanna leave because chad is on and i dont wanna leave him unless i gotta.... mrs frantz had a st joe yearbook from his freshman year and he was sooo cute in that pic! i cant wait to meet him! well i dont really have much to say today im just totally stressed and i feel like crying it really really really sucks!
