I found a poem on Bolt that I would like to share with you right now. I think that it is truly amazing its awesome, I know I couldn't have done better. Here it is thanks to Kristen:   All these voices inside my head  more often than not, wish i was dead  Something keeps telling me theres something wrong  but deep inside i knew all along  Ive been forced against my will  and been staring out my windowsill  ive wanted this for a long time  actually appriciating what is mine   Finally figured out we're all the same  life is a wreck, one hell of a game  love can be painful but not in my case  my kinda love is a bad thing to waste  he's been there through thick and thin  telling me not to give up, that one day i'd win  i love him so much words cant explain  even on those days i feel so much pain   just like the time i felt used  just like the time when i was abused  i'd sit and cry alone  the air seemed stiff, cold, and silent to the bone  i wanted to go underneath that rock  when indside my head the voices would knock   They'd tell me not to end it  but my heart was never mended  i tried to take my own life away  i left people speechless, without a word to say  the blows were hard, they hurt like hell  further further then down i fell   amazing isnt it? I just love this poem I cant stop reading it. Thank you again Kristen....
