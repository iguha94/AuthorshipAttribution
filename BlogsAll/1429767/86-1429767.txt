no not from partying but from a day of being in a REALLY REALLY bad mood like almost blowing up on everyone for no reason, and from almost crying in history because i felt really sick and things just arent the best they could be right now... so sorry to everyone if i was bitchy at you today i just wanted to be sitting at home, alone, isolated from all the shit that i dont really feel like dealing with sometimes. once i got home i started to feel a little better until my mom started blabbering on about gay marriages again and i try to bite my tounge and hold my feelings back but i almost just blew up on her but i held it all back and as hard as it was i did an ok job of i it just sat there and said yeah, ok, yeah, whatever i dont really care what she thinks i know there is plenty of people out there behind gay marriage and we wont stop until it's "legalized" in all states. president bush *sighs* announced again to urge congress to pass a constitutional amendment to outlaw gay marriages, that just pissed me off he needs to realize that he's in the whitehouse not the pulpit separation of church and state right? last time i checked the constitution says we the people and equal rights for all in the land, well we the people means we need to fight for our rights as a whole and stop the government from violating those rights. its time to stop bush now get him out of office before its too late i urge you to contact your senator and congressman as soon as possible to stop bush now in his efforts to discriminate against homosexuals and if you're old enough to vote dont waste your oppourtunity to do so vote against bush and his discriminatory ideas. there is only one person that i can express so much disgust and hate and that is our "leader" president bush, our leader to a hateful society...
