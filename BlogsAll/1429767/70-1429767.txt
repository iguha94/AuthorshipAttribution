today so far has pretty much sucked really bad. in biology all we did was take notes the whole hour and i cant say that i remember what the hell it was even about anymore, and that was just 2 hours ago. im extremely tired again i couldnt sleep very well i just kept thinking about chad and stuff like that.... in french we learned some family vocab that i cant remember now, damn i hate being tired i need like a gallon of mountain dew or espresso to keep me awake... o well... we have a sub today that keeps walking around and around so i cant get on aol to talk to chad, it would be better to get caught doing this than talking to chad, dammit i really wanna talk to him too but i guess ill just have to wait until tonight when i get home.... i have drivers ed today for the first time and im kinda nervous/excited about it, im going to be riding in a car w/ josh so at least i'll know somebody there and all so i guess its not so bad, amber said that i wont be driving today, just setting up schedules for driving and then going through the intro to the book or whatever i dont know.... so i guess i better get going *sighs* i have history after lunch so im not looking forward to that and dammit i miss chad soooo much! *kisses* and im gonna say it again, trust me babe i wont leave you for anyone else im definately sure that right now theres no one else, hell i dont care if simple plan knocked on my door and wanted to go out on a date or something i would say no because i have you right? well bye.....
