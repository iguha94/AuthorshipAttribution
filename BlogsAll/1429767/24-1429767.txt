today was actually pretty good, save the three hours of it that i did homework, but science olympiad was a blast we just chilled in mr lyles room and launched some tennis balls in the hallway and stuff... yeah it was fun... science olympiad is only a week away from monday so im like totally excited about it! i meant to post some poetry today that i had on my usb drive but i think i have it in my locker at school so i might do it tomorrow in school, im not sure if ill get the time though, just have to see what goes down and play it by that... it wasnt anything spectacular though, i think i've written better.... my neck is killing me today because of excessive homework i think, so now i will probably have to take some ambien to fall asleep tonight, im not going to do what i did last night, i didnt fall asleep until about 4 and i woke up at 615, i couldnt sleep for the life of me, i was super tired when i crawled out of bed so i just drank 4 cups of coffee and drank 2 pepsis at school and i was ready to go.. mmm i love caffiene, its like fuel, without it i would be a heap of sleeping shit, yeah im just a tad addicted lol.... well i guess thats all i have to say for now, im kind of hyper for some reason probably because im glad to be done with homework for once.... well thats it...
