         Another gray and rainy day, but we need the moisture, so I won't complain. Kel was wide awake when the alarm went off and up and out to school on time for the bus. Guess she was happy to get back to her friends. I don't think tomorrow will go quite as well. She's exhausted and full of headache (and homework) tonight.   Finally watched The Matrix Reloaded today while I did the run and was so sucked into it that I broke my cardinal rule and even sat down and finished watching it after I finished the run. I usually only allow myself to movie while I'm running. I should have saved the end for tomorrow's run because I have no movies for tomorrow. I do, however, have a coupon for Mr. Movies - rent a new release and get a second movie free... Might be time to go rent the third Matrix now that the second is fresh in my mind!    Today's miles:  4.5  Total so far:  455  Still to go for goal:  45  Had a Relay meeting tonight. It's getting close! I'm getting excited!  Working on postcards to get out to the people who pledged per mile now that I'm within 50 miles to let them know I'm down to the wire and to be looking for a pledge envelope from me soon. Really soon. In just a couple of weeks. I'm bringing it home.
