         No running today as ordered by Sue my magnificent massage therapist. Got a massage from her too! And in all honesty, she ordered a  week  of rest. Well, if she ever finds this website (Hi Sue!) and manages to comment on it... I'll know that she found me out and discovered that this one day was my week of rest... ahem.   In other news, she pointed me toward some arch supports to help with the foot problem, realigned my twisting pelvis (I swear I'm just doing too many Elvis moves) and got me on the road to recovery. I'll be fine tomorrow.   Got e-mails from Kel and Bill (one of her fabbo traveling companions...). He sent photos! So I've decided to post one. I'll leave the rest (unless I get a really great one that can't wait) for her to share with her friends before I post any more later. Perhaps when he makes a photo CD for them, he'll also make one for their parents who may never see that CD again, or any copies of the photos from it! (hint hint)  So here are the girls, climbing the stairs to their seats in the First Class section!        Now I'm going to join my hubby at whatever he's going since I just got him home from his apartment for the weekend.   See you tomorrow when I'm back to post my miles for the day!
