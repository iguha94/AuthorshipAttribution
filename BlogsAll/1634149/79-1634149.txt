           Conversations in Space     KinnicChick:  testing testing. is you on or is this the ghost???  KinnicChick:  woooooooooooo calling the spirit of marge.... are you there????  KinnicChick:  come in marge...  KinnicChick:  (lighting candles and incense... turning out lights... closing eyes) mmmmmmmmmarge...  KinnicChick:  mmmmmmmarge...  KinnicChick:  come on! You just sent that e-mail! You've GOT to be online!!! (breaking concentration, eyes flying open, nearly falling off chair and onto floor)...  KinnicChick:    MARGE!!!!    KinnicChick:  Hey, wait a minute. I'm not getting a message back saying anything about her. Don't I usually? Or do I add those witty silences and stuff later when I post them into my blog? Hmmmmm. Feeling stupid...  KinnicChick:  insert huge stupid smiley face grin here - :D  Marge:  (Complete and utter silence)  KinnicChick:  I'm so bored. Ho Hum.  Marge:  (The kind of silence that hums in your ears)  KinnicChick:  She really  did  just send me an e-mail so I don't understand this at all.  Marge:  (Silence so deep you begin to wonder if you really are alone in the world and everything else is just a dream)  Time passes   KinnicChick:  Well, now it's been about 15 minutes since she sent it and it's getting rather late at night, so I suppose she has gone by now and signed off. Brat. I guess I may as well give up on her. Snot. Your loss, Marge. You had this great opportunity to chat with me but you blew it and got off line right after sending me an e-mail without waiting five minutes to see if I would bring up my buddy list and find you first. Oh well. Maybe next time. See you tomorrow! At the challenge write-off!     Keri sits there quietly looking at her screen for several more minutes wondering if perhaps she should just wait a little longer because maybe Marge is watching the one-sided conversation and laughing at her, but then she decides that if that  is  the case, it's best to cut her losses now and turn off the computer and go to bed.
