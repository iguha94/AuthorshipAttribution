           Another Week Begins...    Hope everyone had a good weekend. Ours went quickly. The first without Kel around and without the extra dashing about to take her to this party or that movie and it still went by fast.    We enjoyed brunch in Red Wing. We had many laughs, took a family portrait (minus six missing family members), ate too much food, saw some people we knew which surprised us considering we were several miles from home, (I saw my first boss at the corporate IT job I had in St. Paul - that was a big surprise - and he even remembered me), and then we dashed back home for a nice Sunday afternoon before getting Keith back to his apartment. On the way we made a pit stop at Dunn Bros. and enjoyed a plate of vegies and dip before indulging in a mocha brownie and some coffee. Yum.  Once at the apartment I spent a bit of time assembling his new vacuum cleaner, following directions and putting all of the pieces together. There were no spare parts or missing pieces. It was great. And it even ran right once it was finished. Afterwards there was no rush to get Kel back home to finish homework so I stayed there and watched the sunset over the lake with him and we laughed at our silly jokes for a while. I took off when I could no longer see the sun. I planned to run when I got home, but decided instead to go to bed early.  I think I'll do two workouts today if I'm in the mood later to head to the old hometown and head to the school with mum. We'll see. That will make up for it, I figure.   Here's today's stats...   Monday's miles:  4.25  Total so far:  430.19  Still to go for goal:  69.81  Those miles are just moving down there! I'm liking it!  Got more photos and updates from the traveling kid today! I'm so jealous! They sound like they're having a great time...
