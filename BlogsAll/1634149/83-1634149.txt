         I didn't go far... I'm not feeling tip top yet and jogging the body around just isn't what I'm up for yet. I did a slow walk. Very slow. As a result it didn't get me very far, but I had to start putting the miles back on. So here's how I did. Gulp.   Today's miles:  2.5  Total so far:  440.5  Still to go for goal:  59.5  I know what you're thinking. I'm thinking the same thing. But don't sweat it. I can still do it. Thirteen days is a long time. We all wanted this to be a fight to the finish, didn't we? I know I did!   Going to bed now.   Moving for Elsie tomorrow. Didn't know she was a survivor. Glad to know she is. (in rereads this sounds a little strange - not surprised to know she is because she IS survivor like... does that make sense? I hope so...) You go girl! :-)   Oh, before I go...   Heard from my lovely daughter tonight. She says  everyone  in Tokyo has adorable shoes.   So she bought some. Like mother, like daughter (like grandmother should be in there, too...)!   I love that child and look forward to seeing her. She's sounding under the weather. And her back is bothering her. Sounds like I should contact her fabbo chiropractor now and get her set up for an appointment toward the end of the week. I think she's going to need it. I can't wait for the big hug I'm going to get at the airport on Monday!
