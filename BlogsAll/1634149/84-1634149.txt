           I'm back. Sort of.    Still in some pain both behind my right eye (migraine) and in the abs (food allergy???) but I  will  put some miles behind me today.   Mum and Jan and I went shopping on Thursday. We had many laughs and I may have found some new running shoes (thanks Mum!). I'll know more when I try on a different size this next week.   I learned from Jan that according to an interior decorator she knows, you must have at least one wall in your house painted with your favorite color. I'm lucky enough to have two  rooms  in my house painted in the coolest shade of green with white trim. My whole mood changes (improves) when I walk into them. Her decorator is right!   Did you know that when you are standing in the vicinity of a turkey vulture's nest (aka too close for comfort), they may decide to circle overhead so close that they break branches off the tree tops above you and you can hear them swooping through the air with their gigantic wingspan? A little something Keith and I learned on one of our spring walks.   I'll be back later with my miles for the day.   I'm planning to steal   Marn's  idea when the Relay arrives and write names on my T-shirt for anyone you would like remembered who fought the battle with cancer. If you would please send me their names in my comments section, I will happily begin compiling a list of those names so that when I get my t-shirt I can begin to get the names on it. Obviously, all those names on the right for whom I have run so far will go on it, but I know there are names I haven't heard yet. Send them on, please!
