           Thursday Question...    Okay. Here we are with my fascinating question of the week hoping to generate some additional comments because you all know how I like to hear from people.     Mwaaa  to my regular comment posters!   This week's question comes to us from   The Little Book of Stupid Questions  (and yes, I do actually own this book; a writer must have all sorts of research and idea material)...   Is it more time efficient (and just plain  better ) to put on both socks and then both shoes, or one sock, one shoe and then the other sock, the other shoe?   I actually saw this situation argued on an episode of All in the Family between Archie Bunker and his son-in-law, who's name - other than Meathead - totally escapes me now. They must have argued about it for a good 10 minutes! I won't tell you who was on what side of the argument or what his view was until after I hear your comments, good people. I DO hope I hear your comments.   Okay. I have work to do. I hope you all get back to me on this very serious issue in our world today.   And by the way - Happy April Fools Day! Hope it is a good one for you and someone is able to play a great joke on you. Because everyone needs a good laugh in life.
