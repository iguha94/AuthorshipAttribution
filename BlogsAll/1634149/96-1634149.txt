         I Made it!  Today's Miles: 5.4 Miles So Far: 501.03 Still to go for goal: (1.03)  Keli ran with me today. It was a beautiful day for it, although I did moan a bit about the cold wind until we really got going. She gave me many kudos for how far I've come because she hasn't run with me for a long time and my conditioning has changed considerably since then.   This is us coming down our road on the way in.     yep. here we are running down the road. can you picture it?    When I got back to our road I had tears streaming down my face because, let's face it... I never imagined back in November what a trip this was going to be. I believed I could do it (sort of). I thought the time frame was doable. I hoped I would hear from people giving me names of people to run for to help inspire me, and as you can see from the list at the right, there was a lot of inspiration. Damn cancer.   Here I am at the finish line Keith had waiting for me when I got back. :) Kel wouldn't cross it with me. I insisted but she wouldn't do it. "It's  your  500 miles, Mum." And blasting from the car stereo as I came across the finish line he was playing David Bailey... My favorite CD - Coffee with the Angels. Go out to   CD Baby  and buy it. Now. It's good stuff.     Hey! Look how much energy I have after 5 miles!    And the medal he "made" me...     Isn't it cool? It says "Survivor of 500 miles!"    Now I get to return! And I shall. 500 miles. But first I'm going to take about a week and simply walk. And nurse the achilles in both legs. Ice. Lots of it.   And I'm going to blog that return. And I hope you'll join me. Because I'll miss you if you don't.   Listening to:  Vangelis - Chariots of Fire  of course...
