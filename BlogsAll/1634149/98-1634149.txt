         Well, what will I do when it's over???   Today's miles:  2.6  Total so far:  478.47  Still to go for goal:  21.53  It was a very busy day today... I had to go to town and partake in my annual physical (fun fun...) and even though it's a year early, my doc and I decided that I would have my baseline mammogram this year so I'll get to have that in June (first available appointment). My blood pressure was still super low even with the bp lowering meds cut in half at that last appointment, so that was great news. We're watching for a little while longer and I may get off them altogether in the next couple of months.   After that appointment I had mailings to do for the people who have pledged per mile to update them on how things are going and a post office trip to make. Then I had to get to the school to pick up Kel and Lauren and take them to the florist for an errand they needed to run. From there it was home to do some serious prep work for a party Kel is having tomorrow night so it just wasn't your five-mile-run kind of night!  And tomorrow is party night, so I think tomorrow is going to be a short one, too...   Besides, I just don't want to see this end! It's the journey, not the destination, after all.   And as Keith says, what am I going to do when I get to Nowhere, and how am I going to get back???
