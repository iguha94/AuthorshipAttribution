         Yep. Daylight savings time. Gotta love it. Lost an hour. One hour I could have been running. Or sleeping. Or laughing. Or eating. Or whatever.   For me I guess sleep is most important. I hate losing out on sleep. So yeah, I guess I lost out on sleep. That's the hour that disappears anyway since the big change happens at 2 am. Kel can attest to that. She was online at two. She was chatting with friends and suddenly noticed it was after three. She realized she had totally missed out on the two o'clock hour but Spense assured her that it hadn't really happened so it was okay. It was just DST. She was relieved. And yes, she slept until after 1 this afternoon.  She and Keith really rocked on the Algebra II this weekend. They finished six days worth in just a few hours. He taught her the concepts and sat with her while she did the homework. She's now finished with her homework for the Japan trip with the exception of some reading of novels and the journal that she has to write during/about the travels. With 20 hours on the plane, the reading should get done in flight, hopefully.   To all of you spring breakers here in RF - have a safe and happy vacation!   Well, since I lost out on that sleep last night, I guess I'll go grab a bit now. Kel's down cleaning her room so I don't think she'll be getting any very soon. She has laundry to accomplish for the trip so I think I'll hear the washer going in the wee hours once she has gathered things together...  Here are today's stats toward my 500 miles to nowhere. Just to say thanks once again for all of the support, the sponsorships are still coming in the mail - I'm so grateful for your generosity... THANK YOU!!!!!!!  I ran again today for Mary M... This was her weekend!   Today's miles:  4.25  Total so far:  396.21  Still to go for goal:  103.79  No reason I shouldn't be under 100 miles after tomorrow! Should be reason for celebration!
