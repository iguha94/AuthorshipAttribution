         I do not know what my dog managed to find that was edible during his adventures outside the dog run, but he sure is gassy now...    + + + + +   Also, Alta updated the comments down in the "Winding Down" post with a great idea for the finale' of my run... I think we should go with that. Since nobody else came up with anything. Unless ya'll are still thinking. Anybody?    + + + + +   Today's miles for Dana!!!: 3.51 Total so far: 438 Still to go for goal: 62  I'm going to go do some writing now with paper and pens in my favorite coffee shop. Because I can. Because I don't have to take anybody anywhere. Or pick anyone up and wait for them. Mmmm. Coffee. Scones. I'll be back. But don't wait for me.   And tomorrow? Shopping. With the girls. And lunch! On Grand Avenue! Yeah!   + + + + +   But before I forget, I just wanted to let you all know, that Newman's Own Ginger'N Creme Ginger-O's are the best cookies in the world and you should all run right out and get some. They have a crunchy, zippy good ginger cookie sandwiched around a creamy sweet (and light!) filling (way better than the oreo filling you find these days).   Tell 'em Keri sent you! (I've always wanted to say that)  Besides, there's the added bonus of a handsome picture of Paul on the package looking quite sweet in a pair of bib-overalls and holding a pitchfork!     (No money has changed hands in the endorsement of this product. I just think they make a darned good cookie).
