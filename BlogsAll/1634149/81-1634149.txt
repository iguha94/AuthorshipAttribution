           Thank you...    Bloggers are some of the nicest people on earth, as demonstrated by   Bill . Thank you, Bill. I shed some fat tears of gratitude reading your blog this morning. You and your family are good people. You make my running so much easier. You and my folks' and Hutch and her kids and that list of people over on the right of my blog, and the Kathies, and Marge and   Marn , and all of my regular posters who make it so much easier to update here every day, and Kel who gives me some of my best material to post about, and of course my husband without whom I never would have gotten this whole thing started because I may never have gotten involved in the Relay in the first place.   Thank you. Thanks for donating. Thanks for your words of support. Cheering me on helps me immensely. I don't have a lot of time to go read up on what's happening in a lot of your lives, so when you come here and give me your words of encouragement, you can't imagine what it does for me. But you can see the numbers! Bloggers, I ran for you today.   Thank you...   Today's miles:  5.25  Total so far:  401.46  Still to go for goal:  98.54  Adding another duck to my progress chart!
