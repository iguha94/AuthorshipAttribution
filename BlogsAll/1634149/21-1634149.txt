          For all you BT Warriors out there, I ran for you today. This includes Tim, from the Brain Tumor conference in Denver - one of the most endearing men you'll ever want to meet and his sweet wife, and all of you out on the boards at NBTF that we've met along the way, and those we haven't had the opportunity to meet yet.   And I didn't run watching some movie to keep my mind off my pain and agony or the miles or the exhaustion, although, I did have some distraction.   I put in the new Christmas DVD    Christmas with Chanticleer  . We saw this amazing group of men at The Ordway in St. Paul a couple of years ago and really enjoyed their concert, so this DVD was no disappointment. It wasn't as good as seeing them live, of course, but it was really fun to see them on stage again, even if only on TV. We have a few of their CD's, but this is better because they are all so yummy to look at. And because it can be so impossible to believe that all of the voices singing that music are male. They have an incredible vocal range!  So here are today's stats for the BT Warrior's run...  Today's Miles: 3.50 Total so far: 87.00 Still to go for goal: 413  Tomorrow I will run for Tracey, one specific friend of Keith's from the BT world.   Sure is quiet out here... sniffle.
