         After many laughs with   Bill  in the past over Peeps and the many iterations they've been through in their marketing twists and turns over the years (not that  I'd  ever eat them, mind you), I had to laugh today when Keith and I went into our favorite coffee shop in the old home town and found the front page of the Express section of the cities paper covered with photos of Peeps in dioramas sent in by readers competing for prizes. A funny little contest by the paper. Here's a link. Hope you get a kick out of it. Make sure you scroll through the photos. They were priceless. And the article was pretty humorous, too!     Peep show   On with my workout.   Update: Man, did I have troubles trying to publish this! I spent many frustrating hours hopping in and trying to get it to take. Thought I was going to have to spend all week next week re-vamping my site just to get things going again. Thank goodness things are finally moving this morning (Sunday). I'm changing date and time to reflect the time I actually wrote and ran to reflect truth in publishing. :) I'll be back later today if I have anything to report from a running standpoint, but Keith and I are off to Red Wing, Minnesota now to celebrate my parents' 51st Wedding Anniversary with them and one of my brothers and his family. The other bro' is entertaining his in-laws for Easter. Happy Weekend to all... And here are the stats from yesterday...    Don't worry Sue (if you actually found the site)... I took it easy, despite the numbers...   Saturday's Miles:  4.0  Total so far: 425.94  Still to go for goal:  74.06  Later!
