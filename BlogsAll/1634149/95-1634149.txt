           Stormy Nights, Gorgeous Days...    We had quite the storm last night. It woke us up around 2. Thunder, lightning, and hail that hit the house and windows so hard, I was certain there would be damage to something. Some of the hail wasn't only the size of marbles, they were as big as  shooters!  But I went out in the lovely heat today and worked in the yard for a couple of hours while Keith soaked in his much-cooled hot tub (storms frequently trip the breaker to just the hot tub, and we frequently don't notice it until the temperature has dropped several degrees) and didn't notice any damage to any of my plants even. On an unrelated but thrilling springtime note, I did get to pull a deer tick off my shirt at one point.   Yesterday after my walk I wandered around the field looking at the growth in the pines we've planted and ended up pulling five wood ticks off of myself. They are definitely thick this year. The veterinarian told us it would be a banner year for them. He said he saw them earlier than he could ever remember seeing them before (February). I wondered after having five easy-to-spot wood ticks, how many deer ticks I must have, but I couldn't find any. They can be such hard little buggers to find, though. My dog  *Satanic creature*  loves to bring them as gifts and deposit them in the bed for us in the night. We sometimes find them the next day creeping toward us on the dark purple blanket.  If we're lucky enough to see them.   *devil dog*   Well, it's time to take Keith back to his apartment. I'll be back and post my mileage later. Hope you're all having an enjoyable Sunday.
