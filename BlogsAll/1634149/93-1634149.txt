           Distractions...    I haven't done one of these in a long time and I found this one over at   Krush's  place and thought it looked interesting. Curiosity got the best of me and I had to find out...            Which Disney Princess are you?     Not a bad result for me at all!    Updated for Alta!  Kida is the Defender of the Empire! She's from Atlantis. I had no idea what you were talking about because I'd never seen this movie! I had to Google her! I'm still waiting to hear what Princess my Dad is most like, too! :)    + + + + +   Many thanks to   Bill  for again sending people my way from he and his wife's place yesterday! I totally appreciate the plug as I'm getting down toward the finish line on my run. I would like everyone to know that I'll be accepting donations for the Relay for Life right up until the relay, too! You can click on my donations button over there on the right and know that every penny you donate will go to the American Cancer Society. Thank you so much! It means a lot to us to be doing something after what we experienced with Keith and what we have seen since then in getting to know other cancer survivors and victims.    + + + + +   Today was   DoS  at Kel's school (well, nationwide actually but I just mean that her school also participated) for those who signed up to participate. She said it was pretty tough being quiet for so long!    + + + + +   Well, I've put off today's run for a while here, eh? Guess I'd best get to it. A very tired Kel is napping and I told her I'd wake her up around 6:30 for some dinner and to help her study. That gives me a little over an hour to lurch along on Lurch (my treadmill). I haven't picked up the final Matrix yet because I forgot the coupon. *sigh* Guess I'll have to watch something else.   I'll be back with mileage.   Thanks again Bill!
