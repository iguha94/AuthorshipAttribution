         Tune in tomorrow night to America's Most Wanted (Saturday 4/24 - 8 pm Central but please check your listings for time and station). They will be highlighting a murder case that means a whole lot to me and all of the people in my little home town. We want to see it solved. You remember those families I ran for back in   February ? Danny was loved by everyone in the town. His funeral was the largest I know of in the town history. If everybody, everywhere watches this show, maybe somebody, somewhere will see something or hear something that will trigger some little memory of something they heard.   I don't know. It's a long shot.   All I'm asking is that you watch. And that you tell everybody you know to watch.   Fellow Bloggers? This would get even further if you would all put in a plug, too. You can link back to me for the explanation if you want. I'd so much appreciate it and owe you all a Blog it Forward or something.   Please. It would mean a whole lot to me. And everybody in my little hometown. And two families torn apart by a senseless murder still unsolved.   What's one more hour of television in the scheme of things. Most everybody watches television, right? I'm just asking that people do it with a purpose in mind.   Thanks.
