         Well, my memory post went over well, as Mark so kindly pointed out for me. Thanks pal. :-P Guess people are loving the new look of my boring blog or something.   Anyway, been working on the gardening and yard around here. I think it's looking better than it has in a couple of years. I'd been ignoring the foundation plantings and they've been getting away from me. Even got the birdhouses out. The squirrels are thrilled.   Going to start up with the running again today. A week is a long enough hiatus. I can't stand  not  running anymore. By the looks of the wind, though, it will be with Lurch. Besides, with the great speakers now hooked up to the movie projector (thanks Dad!), I've got to go experience a movie and what better way than while I run?  The   David Bailey  concert last night was great, as always. He played a little new, a lot of old, and mixed in some of his typical David humor. Keith got to talk to him afterward for a bit, which was really terrific. David also had a special guest who will now be another of our favorite musicians, I think. His name is Michael Billet and he plays "Impressionistic acoustic guitar". It was beautiful. He is a survivor of cancer also - a tumor which was removed from his neck. Surgery and radiation took care of it, but seven years later it returned. "Another surgery saved his life but left him unable to speak... except through his guitars."   Okay. Off to the garden. Back later to post the running miles.
