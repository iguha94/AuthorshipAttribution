talking to brandy has made me realize i'm never finding another vero. or soraya. so do you settle for less? do you search for perfection? and where do you search, a new face, or and old grace?   I guess we'll really know when we find that person, that's when you'll be able to say it. What i must learn is to stop analyzing things to fualt, to just realize i have someone by myside and please that person the most possible. Sometimes, i gotta learn to just not tell things to the girlf. and have that go to brandy.  And since she's been in my dreams now,it's true waht she said, wouldn't i tbe the most ironic piece of shit, if  while looking for the perfect person it ends up being the one under my nose(bradny lol). that would be the seriously most pathetic thing on earth. Saywe're 18 and then we noticed that would mean 4 years of opening up joys and pains to one another like fools, bitching about guys and girls to each other, and then praising some of them, telling each otehr our observatioons, we end up realizing it's each OTHER we need! that'd be like life slapping you in the face for being stupid lol. 0n the other hand for me that would work out nice, brandy's totally gnarly, so it'd be cool.   Speaking  of slaps in the face i have a huge migraine, so i'll blab about this later, i'm not feeling so well
