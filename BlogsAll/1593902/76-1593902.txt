One day in the great forest a magical frog was walking down to a  water hole. This forest was so big that the frog had never seen  another animal in all his life. By chance today a bear was  chasing after a rabbit to have for dinner.   The frog called for the two to stop. The frog said, "Because you  are the only two animals I have seen, I will grant you both  three wishes. Bear, you go first." The bear thought for a  minute, and being the male he was, said, "I wish for all the  bears in this forest, besides me, to be female."   For his wish, the rabbit asked for a crash helmet, and  immediately put it on. The bear was amazed at the stupidity of  the rabbit, wasting his wish like that.   It was the bear's second turn for a wish. "Well, I wish that all  the bears in the next forest were female as well."   The rabbit asked for a motorcycle and immediately hopped on it  and gunned the engine. The bear was shocked that the rabbit was  asking for these stupid things, after all, he could have asked  for money and bought the motorcycle.   For the last wish the bear thought for awhile and then said, "I  wish that all the bears in the world, besides me, were female."   The rabbit grinned, gunned the engine, and said, "I wish that  the bear was gay."   _________________________________ how do u fit 4 gay guys on a bar stool? - turn it up-side-down ______________________________________________________________________ 3 blondes are on a desert island.
