"some poeple think this guy's a moron and by some peoplei mean everyone, here you go it's Tom Green"  then they fucked up on using him, idiots __________________________________  My dating skills (uh oh)    Etiquette   Although you are probably well-mannered on a first date, based on your responses, you could still afford to polish your etiquette a bit more. You might feel a little too comfortable on first dates, or possibly just too nervous to keep your cool. Being yourself and behaving in a considerate and respectful manner is a surefire way to reveal that you are a confident and classy person.   Sexual   It appears that you are a confident person and you do not feel the need to use your sexuality to get a date. You have probably found subtle ways to show your interest without acting too available, needy or desperate. Chances are that you do not regard sex as a way to manipulate your date into wanting to see you again. If, however, you choose to follow your sexual impulses, you probably do it for the right reasons -- not simply to please your date.    Content   You seem to have found the perfect balance between speaking and listening on a first date. You probably enjoy having a very natural give-and-take dialogue, and you are aware that there should be boundaries regarding how much is appropriate to reveal about yourself at such an early stage of a relationship. Chances are you do not try to please your date by always agreeing with them, and you probably don't take the spotlight off of them by always bringing the attention back to you. Continue to be yourself and you will soon find the right one!
