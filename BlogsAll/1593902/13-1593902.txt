to Meily, for everything  I never thought I'd ever need someone As much as I need you You brighten my day in every way You make my life feel so brand new And every time I think about the way You make me feel inside I get a great feeling, the kinda great feeling  You get when you're full of pride  And it all happened at one moment in time When I realized the greatest gift was mine and  You, you're the best thing that ever happened to me It's definitely you I want you to forever stay with me, don't go away You've made it real easy to see that You're the best thing that ever happened to me  In my life there are many things that  Bring me up and bring me down And if I looked all over the world  I don't think I could ever have found Someone who makes my life worth living  Makes the rainy day seem bright This is the strongest feeling I've felt 'Cause in my heart I know it is right  And it all happened at one moment in time  When I realized the greatest gift was mine and  You, you're thr best thing that ever happened to me It's definitely you I want you to forever stay with me, don't go away You've made it real easy to see That you're the best thing that ever happened to me  And if you ever left me now Don't know how I'd go on I'd do anything that I can somehow To keep this going on strong  You, you're the best thing that ever happened to me It's definitely you I want you to forever stay with me, don't go away You've made it real easy to see  That you're the best thing that ever happened to me
