         I Can see how you are beautifull, can you feel my eyes on you, I'm shy and turn my head away Working late in diner Citylite, I see that you get home alright Make sure that you can't see me, hoping you will see me  Sometimes I'm Wondering why you look me and you blink your eye You can't be acting like my Dana, can you? I see you in Citylite diner serving all those meals and then I see reflection of me in your eye, oh please  Talk to me, show some pity You touch me in many, many ways But I'm shy can't you see  Obsessed by you, your looks, well, anyway "I would any day die for you", I write on paper & erased away Still I sit in diner Citylite, drinking coffee and reading lies Turn my head and I can see you, could that really be you  Sometimes I'm wondering why you look me and you blink your eye You can't be acting like my Dana? I see your beautifull smile and I would like to run away from Reflections of me in your eyes, oh please  Talk to me, show some pity You touch me in many, many ways But I'm shy can't you see  I see, can't have you, can't leave you there 'cos I must sometimes see you But I don't understand how you can keep me in chains And every waken hour, I feel your taking power From me and I can't leave Repeating the scener over again  Sometimes I'm wondering why you look me and you blink your eye You can't be acting like my Dana I see your beautifull smile and I would like to run away from Reflections of me in your eyes, oh please  Talk to me, show some pity You touch me in many, many ways But I'm shy, can't you see
