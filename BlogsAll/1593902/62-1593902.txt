I spend my time  Letting these hopeless thoughts run my life  Force me to hide  Just create a truth to all these lies   I will never be the same  So just leave me down while I'm separating  I could never give anymore  All these lies have left me torn   It's only this way falling on my own  I made this mess now its over  It was nobody's fault, it was all my own  Everything's wasted forever   The only hand  That I know how to hold belongs to me  How it began  What I though was right became my insecurity   I will never be the same  So just leave me down while I'm separating  I could never give anymore  All these lies have left me torn   It's only this way falling on my own  I made this mess now its over  It was nobody's fault, it was all my own  Everything's wasted forever   It's on my own  It's on my own   Weakness becomes me  My faults relieve me  My fear excludes me  Turns it against me  My fault  My fear  Turned it against me   It's only this way falling on my own  I made this mess now its over  It was nobody's fault, it was all my own  Everything's wasted forever   It's only this way falling on my own  It's only this way falling on my own  It's only this way falling on my own  It's only this way, it's only this way   It's on my own  It's on my own ______________ Another day, another post.
