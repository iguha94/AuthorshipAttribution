Game 7 of the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium.  The Red Sox against the Yankees.  Pedro Martinez vs. Roger Clemens.  The winner going to the World Series.   Will anybody be watching "Friends" tonight?  ______________________________________________   It isn't about curses. It isn't about goats. It isn't about fans with long arms. It isn't about fate.  Sometimes, it's actually about baseball. What a concept   What folks often forget at times like this is that there are two teams playing in these games. And due to circumstances beyond the control of Bud Selig, the FOX television network, Wood, Prior, Dusty Baker, Bill Murray, Bernie Mac, the Illinois Confederation of Goat Farmers and collectors of red ivy, one of those teams happened to be the Florida Marlins.  If you let them play, it's trouble for everybody. The Giants found that out. The Phillies found that out. All those teams chasing them in the wild-card free-for-all found that out.  And Wednesday night at Wrigley Field, the Marlins delivered that message one more time, with a 9-6 pounding of Wood and the Cubs in Game 7 of an NLCS it will take a long while to forget.  So the Florida Marlins are going to the World Series. They understand they've screwed up about a zillion romantic plot lines. They understand they're about the last team on earth that the poets, the historians and the ratings counters wanted to see show up at that World Series. But that's a problem only for the poets, the historians and the ratings counters  The Marlins' national profile is closer to the Peoria Chiefs than it is to the Cubs, Red Sox or Yankees. But somehow, while we were all busy watching other games and making other World Series plans, the Marlins were winning more games than any of those teams since we finished firing up the Memorial Day barbecues.   On the national airwaves, they aren't the big story in this series, even now. Even after winning it. Even after becoming the fourth team in history to wriggle out of a 3-games-to-1 snakepit in the League Championship Series. Even now that they have a chance to become the first team since the 1914 Miracle Braves to win a World Series in a season in which they were once 10 games below .500.  But that's because this series isn't going to be remembered as the series the Marlins won. It's going to be remembered as the series the Cubs couldn't lose -- but did. That's how this media game works  The World Series. Featuring the Florida Marlins.   (congrats marlins, gooo0o0o0 fish!)
