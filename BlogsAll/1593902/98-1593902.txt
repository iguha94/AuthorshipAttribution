         for me:  Line Up:  Daniel Svensson -drums Peter Iwers -bass Björn Gellote -guitars Jesper Strömblad -guitars Anders Fridén -vocals  1. F(r)iend  As they all felt the fire  They turned me into an outsider I never heard from them again So ironic when you called for a favor today  It's always easy to judge But takes a lot to be specific 'cause as you preach you're opening the door  To your egos past  There was a day when I could forget I could forgive but those days are gone I see them fade  Filth runs in every new day  I learned to mute the anger I never thought I would be there again A moment, a dead end I lost myself in here I ran as I saw the end Should I've joined the fight instead? Hope you're listening 'cause now times have changed  I take a look around Say this moment's mine Flee all the weak minds Feel my missed hidden rage  2. The Quiet Place  Spinning further, deeper I know you're out to try me I'm not in this to be a slave Push the dirt Make me feel Locate what swallows life Night bird you build my world  ...and then I close my eyes  Judge me now Used to be afraid to let it show Bow down I'm in a much better place now Everything's in place So much brighter from today A king in my own mind  Drown the monster Make all bad dreams go away Whatever it takes to keep your hands free Open scars The quiet place All the bridges fall to the ground And you say you sacrificed  3. Dead Alone   I'll always belong to the shadow Don't show me new results I'll never enter your heaven Make the most out of my dirty cell  Creeps infected by control That's what put me in here Dig deep don't think you ever get To the place where they buried me The last glimpse that I have Fragments, pieces of some things valuable even though it doesn't make sense anymore I release my last tear  My frustration My conversation Why are we even here? the abuse That we use I do not longer care  The cold worms and me We are all right We are free The dead light inside Fuel to new seed New world I hide  When there are only my bones Please put them in use Want to be part of a new dawn The day darkness disappears Don't release these chains Never been closer to myself All your mistakes run through As I realize what we become The end is here to bid farewell I'll turn to ash and hear them sing Songs about my emotions dead and alone Don't make an effort You don't know me anyway  4. Touch Of Red  Reaching depths of clarity I'm not supposed to be like this I should be on the top of the world Is anybode out there like me?  I followed - something's missing Self control - forcing me down Whispers consume the air Above her I'm endless  When the rain comes falling I'll freeze, I'm so afraid When things start to flood me I'll drown in seconds  Fear - there's a way out Touch of red Break away Nothing has it all Bury the place I've been I fear there's a way out  As if I ever had a choice All in the hands of the energy Once again I feel the quicksand Swallow me, tonight I won't struggle  The weak in me should know I'm as sober as I could be  5. Like You Better Dead   I can be as angry as I want to be  Just watch me burn (need to be motivated)  I think you're way too cold  Just watch and learn   I'll never sleep here anymore  My house is not my home  I like you better dead  I'm better off alone   Destiny, will you cure me?  Trust, will you age with me?  Hear me scream as I face tomorrow   Your vision may be in colour, but you look all pale  In these times we should be learning but with you I'll always fail   I need to save myself before I drown  It took so long to see  The world your mind creates  It pushes me under  6. My Sweet Shadow   I'm selling heavenly sketches  A world out of my mind  Ready to explode in purity  To fill the wholes inside   An ever moving stream  With glowing rays of light  Emotions tied to past lies  And I know I should let go   I found a flame in the burnt out ashes... burn out, burn out  Tamed with confidence of a brighter future   Fueled these new shores burn  Dark past lies cold  Shadow, my sweet shadow  To you I look no more   Another dawn collapses  Do I need to be reminded?  A glimpse of my safe home  A path to hide all anger   In circles I catch  A torch carried by the immortal  From depths that I created  In vain ecoes fade  7. Evil In A Closet   We were one in words  You finished my sentences  The answer to my puzzle  I can never attract tomorrow  It pushes me aside  I sink in waters deep  Your presence kept me floating  Far from depths where secrets lie  Maybe in another lifetime  I could be the first you meet   I once read a poem  Held my breath  But that moment's gone  First time I felt life somewhat hurts  Need an option and some hope   Yell at me, i want to be your light that shines  But my ground's shaking and I might fall  I wish that I could say... I wish I could be your evil in a closet  8. In Search For I   It hurts to think  Can't get the sums together  Would you draw my bitterness  Make the pictures fade   Could it be that I see  What's beneath when we fall  The truth in ever  I'm scared that I'll be   Will time open my vault  New solution, I'm begging  Break the fuse that holds me back   The I is lost in me  But I'm ready to give you  The m, it might even be the e  As I begin to search for I   Distract, push me in another direction  This wall that I stare into  It's getting old  Give me faith to reach for the new  Pull me apart and do me all over  I'll need a re-make  To make up for my mistakes   What if I stop to care?  What if I let you fall?  9. Borders And Shading  Take a knife and carve it in Want to see your faults As a part of your pretty skin Everyone has a tragedy I want you to wear yours in pain  Oblivion can no longer shade you Tattered tissue as a reminder  Bleak silence Errors stigmatized in you A weak worn out friend There's nothing left for me Again and again Your face reminds me of a bleak future Despite the absence of hope I give you this sacrifice  You're so far behind Be my hero Drift away Save yourself Don't end up zero Your world inside slowly redesigned  I deny any reminisce of us  I'm on a new mission I find myself in the future A trace of the past cannot be found  10. Superhero Of The Computer Rage  I am the past Future I've been chosen You think it's over But I'm ready to go I am what you fear  I've been chosen The world as you know it just died It's the end of all time  I am a surprise Even to myself I'm a genious Superhero of the computer rage In plastic I'll bury I am what you fear I've been chosen The world as you know it just died It's the end of all time  Everything you say is denied I'll be the devil on this ride  Dark clouds in your heaven Your end has only begun You can scream but the re's no rescue I promise I'll make you sure you die in time  I am the maggot In your infected life No matter how hard you try I'll leave without a scar I am a legend In your infotainment life It's when I say "it's over" It's you who's been chosen  11. Dial 595-Escape  Could it be a new day? Fear in me so deep  You push me out, I feel far The absence, close to me The otherside I crawl You push me out, I fall  Heal my wounds with everything Away you complicate me Sick of cycles, drop to zero A while just like last times My least favourite re-run Sick of cycles, I bounce in grey  Escape familiar home Memories remains alone Reality trapped inside The wicked descend - I hide  Testing higher mentality I conquer myself through this A furious path to walk New space does exist beyond In silence I dwell Displeased Remain with the seed of unfulfilment  "Try to remove obstacles as they appear" my master said "Don't look too far, you'll stumble before you're even there"  12. Bottled   I really don't have anything to say  Just pass me by  Don't ask me the same questions  Just deny I'm there   Like the time around me  This room is filled with nothing  Fell awkward in a place with many  Leave this space to me   I channel the pain through this  The paper, the pen, your eyes  To stare into what's next  It frightens me  No control, no reward  I'm in circles again   Still and breathless  I don't care what's behind  To you I look for energy  To catch my breath again   The world looks old to me  Tonight I drink myself sober  Soon this could be over  Tale a picture of the pale   New morning knocking  Feels just like always  Pen down my regrets  I reach to you again
