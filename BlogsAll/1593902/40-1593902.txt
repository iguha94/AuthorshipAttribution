People can't help but fall hook, line, and sinker for your friendly, well-rounded personality and natural charm.  It's a subtle thing, though — being outgoing and flirtatious, not showy, is the name of your game.  Friends, co-workers, and potential dates can't help liking you. How could they not?

What is it about forbidden love that dominates your Garden of Eden romantic fantasy?   Even if you'd never think of acting on it, it's ok to admit that you've been tempted (at least in your fantasy world) by a relationship that just can't be. Everybody has.   Maybe you've just seen The Graduate a few more times than the rest of your friends and "coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson" holds a little more meaning for you. Or maybe you just enjoy keeping your daydreams separate from your real life when it comes to looking for love.
