         i need something. i don't know what, i think i fried my nerves, i'm so vulnerable right now, i feel like after the breakup up with roly. i feel like it's just me agaisnt everyone...and i know it's not what's wrong with me man? I got Odie, i got naty, and i have regained some shards of Brandy....and i think that's what i need. Brandy. I need ehr to keep me emotionally stable, i need someone to hug me and shit. Right now as a joke Naty called me stupid and i started crying, she didn't realize it though. i need a distraction. I'm going to pass my geometry class, no doubts. I will work as hard as nec. and i  will pass  School is ruining me  i need to calm down.  i need a bit of odie, a lot of brandy and a sprinkle of Naty. right now i  just got in my damned bed and cried, and i wish i had someone to cry with, more tears thanks to me saying that.  i feel alone. i feel like puking and i feel like everything which looked good two weeks ago looks like hell now.  The things i really know i need to do are this 1. Brandy, i know i "speak to her everyday" but what i need is...? iunno....something i had over summer. I think i just need to feel like she cares about me....or anyone cares about me, but especially her. 2.. Odie, she's been great lately but i need her to take it up another notch...i need her stupid remarks about me to stop jsut for a little while....like a week or something so i can calm down. I need to think clearly, i need a reality check. and since i have her in person, i need a hug. It's one of those rare, franco needs physical affection times.... 3. School. I don't know how,  but those grades i know are on the up . Lately i've been doing all my h.w. and it is showing in l.a. and biology, and AP. i need it to show in math most though. 4. Guidance....i need someone to pull me through this crap...i need someone with that personlity to tell me to do my shit notworry and do shit my way....i need some tough love but love being the key word not some little asshole. 5. Naty....she's getting closer to me but i need her to be....a bit more mature? i don't know, she'll be the first one i link here. 6. Sofy... i need her attention a little more, i need her to stick with me for more time....  gonna turn off monitor if i remember anyhting, i'll add  edit @ 12:07 Goals for third nine weeks  Language arts B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i've gotten C's without trying, why the hell not?) 9/10 Math= A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (this one is a 6/10 on the likely scale, it's my hardest challenge a B is more likely) Science=B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (easy as doing my work)10/10 Debate=A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (done it) 10/10 JROTC=A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (done it) 10/10 History=B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i've gotten a C doing nothing, now let's see what i do with some effort  7/10  they say i'm intelligent and i ahve potential. These grades would put me on HONOR ROLL. Last done in the 4th grading period of 2nd grade. it's achievable, debate is a minimal work class, JROTC same, Science, prolly a hard work=A class, History same as science and l.a. is easy.
