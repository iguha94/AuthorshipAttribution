         alright i haven't posted ina while.  only posting cause since no one reads this it's fun.  Brandy made me deliriously happy today, and joy's done it a couple of times. Randomly text messaged me. It's those small things that make me happy as hell, and it's those small things that mean the world to me. And since brandy's small, she's my world.
