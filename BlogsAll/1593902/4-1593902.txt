Freak and I aren't talking....  Yea...He was bringing me down again. Bitching about Eric and I.  Let me give you the gist of it: According to Freak, Eric and I will NEVER work out. He sucks and I'm worthy of more. He swears on his life this is going to be another Chris and I situation   But this isn't the first time he makes me doubt one of my relationships  Chris--that was the start of it. Then Esteban. I remember that one the best.  And now Eric. And you know what's funny? He didn't approve of Esteban till after I left him. Moreover, it's the same tactic each and everytime.   See this is how he does it: He fills your mind up with negative thoughts. Makes you think that it will never work 'cause the odds are against you.  Hell, he even relates back to Chris!  "Oh, tits and ass 24/7. You can't compete with that." Well, jee, thanks Freak!!! Nice to know that everything my boy.f says is a crock of shit and will go down the drain when he sees big double D boobs in high school. Oh, and you know what else ?!  He'll sit there and pick the guy apart.  He will find EVERY fault in him and make them seem 100 X's worst than what they are and completely unbearable. Even though we live in a world where no one is perfect, he makes it seem as if I've picked the most imperfect out of the bunch.    Like I told Laura: "This boy puts me on a pedestal, and Franco always tries to knock me off it."  You know what else really blows? I'm weak-hella weak actually, and I'm REALLY easily manipulated. And I miss Freak. I'll prob. unblock him soon... Damn this Big bro. I love you hate you thing. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ from brandy to me. ________________ Now here's my response, see i've had a good day and i have to stand for this shit?  1) i never liked Chrissy. To me he was an intelligent but acted stupid. However this was a boy who hit me for no reason.   2)i like eban...i didn't like him cause i didn't know him....now i know better, shit out fot eh last three maybe he was best, though personally in someways i still likie chris for j0o.  3) this is not a "boy". because even guys usually qualify for IQ's. (goerge bush and tony blair excluded)  4) unless brandy you have a guy in YOUR school next to YOU like you were in rub. it won't work out. TRUST ME. and this goes to any girl out there. and if your intelligent...don't date poles. and i don't mean Polacks.  5) i do break your guys down brandy. and i break EVERYone down. including you. including the bisggest fucking prick out there. me. deal with it  6) don't take shit out on me in public court, ican make you feel like shit in an instant. and you havent seen my bad side.   7)thanks for ruining a good day  8) let's not talk about midget boy anymore  9) i don't knock you off a pedestal...i tell you the truth, because i happen to be realistic
