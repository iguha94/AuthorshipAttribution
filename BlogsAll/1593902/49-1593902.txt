"Life's a show and we all play a part  And when the music starts, we open up our hearts  It's alright if somethings come up wrong  We'll sing a happy song, and you can sing along" LOL! _________________________________________  "Death brings new life..When he falls, he rises...When knocked down, gets up again..That's the true essence of life-The Fighting Spirit "  _______________________  Pretty Good  by Charles Osgood   There once was a pretty good student,  Who sat in a pretty good class  And was taught by a pretty good teacher, Who always let pretty good pass.  He wasn't terrific at reading;  He wasn't terrific at math;  But for him education was leading  Straight down a pretty good path.  He didnâ€™t find school too exciting,  But he wanted to do pretty well,  And he did have some trouble with writing, And nobody had taught him to spell.  When doing arithmetic problems,  Pretty good was regarded as fine;  Five and five needn't always add to be 10,  A pretty good answer was nine.  The pretty good student was happy  With the standards that were in effect,  And nobody thought it was sappy  If his answers were not quite correct.  The pretty good class that he sat in  Was part of a pretty good school,  And the student was not an exception;  On the contrary, he was the rule.  The pretty good school that he went to  Was right there in a pretty go0d town,  And nobody there ever noticed  He could not tell a verb from a noun.  The pretty good student, in fact, was  A part of a pretty good mob.  And the first time he knew what he lacked was  When he looked for a pretty good job.  It was then, when he sought a positon,  He discovered that life can be tough,  And he soon had a sneaky suspicion  Pretty good might not be good enough.  The pretty good town in our story  Was part of a pretty good state  Which had pretty good aspirations  And prayed for a pretty good fate.  There once was a pretty good nation,  Pretty proud of the greatness it had,  But which learned much too late,  If you want to be great,  Pretty good is, in fact, pretty bad.    i love that.
