"It's like a scary version of Kiss" - Slipknot are THE noise of the new millennium and what better way to celebrate by forming your own tribute band. Don't put too much effort into it as by following these easy steps world domination will be yours.   1) Wear frankly ridiculous masks that are far more attractive than your own features complimented with a contrived stage uniform. Choose boiler suits - they are cheap and require minimum effort.  2) Recruit as many friends as your have - nine should do. In case you fall short, grab unsuspecting victims off the street. And of course, musical ability is inessential.  3) It doesn't matter if you can't play guitar, as the sound will be tinny and unrecognisable anyway. If you can't hear the bassist, all the better.  4) Don't forget to add annoying DJ scratching over the top of said noise. Why? Who cares! The kids will just love it?  5) Play the drums as if you are Animal from The Muppets, a sense of rhythm is not required.  6) Tape approximately four minutes of noise and give it a title. It doesn't matter if you cannot reproduce the noise onstage, as fans will be too overpowered by your "madcap" live show to realise.  7) Most important rule - get Ross Robinson to produce said noise. Why not jump on the bandwagon as everything Mr Robinson does is hailed as a masterpiece.  8) Swear constantly throughout interviews and state how F**KING INTENSE everything is (even if you're a nice homeboy really)  9) Make sure onstage entertainment is increased by getting band members to beat each other with some frozen cow heads, just for, you know, sheer delight.  10) Congratulations, you are now Slipknot!   * Mushroomhead were rumoured to have used these tips (or was it the other way round....!)  * Please note: This guide was written back in the year 2000 when Slipknot did carry a dead crow in a jar and bash each other on-stage with cow heads (fact). The band do not do this anymore! Also, Joey is a decent drummer, regardless of this guide ;)  )______________________________________________________________________________________  131 Ways To Tell You're A Mallcore Kid     1.

I will certainly have to admit that a lot of you have some (sic) assed opinions about some crazy bands.  1. Anyone who ridicules a band by using an incorrect word (IE: slipknot fukkin sux) is incredibly ignorant and should seriously look up on getting a higher education.  2. Anyone who ridicules a band and doesn't have a thing to back their shit up (real facts and opinions), then you seriously need to read my recommended advise on #1!!  3. SOAD do not have lyrics in which over half of them are "ginuwinely" (correct spelling would be GENUINELY) non-sense. I respect SOAD mostly for their anti-war thinking! GOOD FOR THEM!  4. Knocking Slipknot, eh? Wow! That's a tough one! I didn't know it was even possible. Slipknot is one of those rare popular bands out there who actually have original sounds, looks, lyircs, attitudes, and they plain just don't give a shit who judges them, to be quite honest.I LOVE Slipknot for what/who they are! You need to recognize that knocking a band is NOT going to make them disappear, but it will piss you off in the end b/c all you are doing is wasting your pitiful a pathetic breath on your opinion which in no way is relevant to anything about a band. It is of non-importance, and your opinion shall stay that way.  5. Joey "1" Jordison - Slipkot's (sic) and excellent drummer. Who the hell said Joey has no talent, speed, or rythm? I would like to meet you and slap you with the harsh and cruel terms of reality! Wake up, my friend. Joey will never ever be beaten by ANY drummer in ANY band! EVER! My dad (you know how parents are) absolutely despises the music I listen to! I don't understand it, but, hey. . . I accept it. HOWEVER, he has told me - my dad is a drummer himself - that he has never seen a better drummer, or faster, than Joey 1" Jordison. This is coming from a guy who doesn't even like the band. I do reckon that is saying a lot!  5. For those of you who can defend your favorite band, and do it constructively and maturely without any name calling or mud-slinging, I respect you to the nth degree! It is more interesting to hear someone who may not like Slipknot, but explains in their own opinions why in a calm and collective way, than hearing someone say "nu-metal sux ass, and slipknot fukkin sux too"!  6. To the dude that made this "humor" section of the website. Bro, I am telling this to you as a friend to friend situation. In no way do I intend to criticise you in any way. This site was funny for about the first three paragraphs, then it went too far and it did get offensive. I found it quite offensive, but I am not having a conniption fit over it like most people would. I realize that you have warned us in advance to viewing the site that it was to be taken "in light of", but a lot of true fans are not going to sit there and laugh at the list, when it may pertain in a negative perception to their band. It just isn't funny, and I am just advising you to take a second thought on keeping this part of the site up. However, it's your choice.  I end with the note that I wish all my fellow maggots stay (sic), and may the 'Knot be your influence at all times! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Understand this: This has never been a popularity contest. The people we care for and work with know who they are and how we feel about them. Slipknot has never been into name-dropping. So, we dedicate this album to the ones that matter the most, our crazy fans and maggots all over the world. Stay (sic), fuckers!  - Slipknot (Iowa)
