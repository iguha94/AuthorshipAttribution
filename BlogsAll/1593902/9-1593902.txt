ok i got you all some new ocnarF ZilaC writings, a bit of a bash on da T.v. a bit or of a rash bleeding first. and Brandy thank you for the template, for some reason we've all been stumped on how to see the posts but it's cool..... ___________________  " Pathetic"  Honestly I don't believe I've ever been this weary My thinking is really tearing my whole inside outside and in I wish I had the nerve to do just something firm about it I'm sure I could live without it but now it seems that we begin  To toss an eye exchange a smile from miles apart it seems And yet it's hard to tell what's really happing from dreams Is it just that we've both thinking is this stuff for real And what if in the midst of this all what if some would see  If this real it seems to me to be good ol' infatuation What if I am wrong and mix the facts with my imagination Knee deep in this mess no wonder I don't sleep too good at night Yes still I've never felt more all right  Hey, were you looking my way or was I standing in the way I'm like a moth hot for the flame I just can't help it  I've been thinking should you accept an invitation Can't help this fascination and yet if you were here I'd freexe I count the days 'til I'll see you again and wish you'll be there And yet if you would come near again I'd get those jelly knees  So we toss an eye exchange a smile but we never move too close And yet make sure to make it short we want no one to know Can I help that I am wondering is this for real Are you thinking much the same as I then you must feel like me Until the two of us have come to terms with how to act from now on We are gonna have to walk in quite wide circles 'round each other Can not wait until the day when you and I decide What to do 'til then I guess I'll be allright _____________________________________________  "Television"  Before that sacred holy flickering tv-screen You're served commercials day-time fakes and tv-priests You keep your VCR running almost constantly Afraid to miss out on something happening on channel three  You zap from channel one to two look what they have done to you You live from staged realities and fakes Channel three then four and five you double check your tv-guide Re-enacted lives to keep you awake  Life is served Here every taste will find our satisfaction guarantee On the never sleeping flickering screen  You keep watching this truly weird masquarade The flickering screen enchants you your truly all enslaved  Nostalgia sports and comedies, cops cartoons and tragedies Remote control at hand you sit enslaved Washing powder and apple pies re-runs soaps and Jesus Christ Anytime is time to zap the world away
