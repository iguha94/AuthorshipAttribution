When it comes to speeches that inspire, there isn't a coach in the world who can compete with Hollywood. Here are my favorite speeches from the silver screen.  _____________________________ Bluto in "Animal House"    Admit it. . .Everyone wanted to be Bluto when they were in college.   My  take: Still one of the single-greatest speeches ever made. That's why Bluto had a great career in politics following his days at Delta House.   D-Day: War's over, man. Wormer dropped the big one. Bluto: Over? Did you say "over"? Nothing is over until we decide it is! Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!  Otter: Germans?  Boon: Forget it, he's rolling.  Bluto: And it ain't over now. 'Cause when the goin' gets tough...  (Bluto pauses, thinking) Bluto: ...the tough get goin'! Who's with me? Let's go! AAAAARRRGH!! (Bluto runs out, alone; then returns) Bluto: What the *#%* happened to the Delta I used to know? Where's the spirit? Where's the guts, huh? "Ooh, we're afraid to go with you Bluto, we might get in trouble." Well just kiss my ass from now on! Not me! I'm not gonna take this. Wormer, he's a dead man! Marmalard, dead! Niedermeyer... Otter: ...Dead! Bluto's right. Psychotic, but absolutely right. We gotta take these bastards. Now we could do it with conventional weapons that could take years and cost millions of lives. No, I think we have to go all out. I think that this situation absolutely requires a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody's part.  Bluto: We're just the guys to do it.  D-Day: Let's do it. Bluto: LET'S DO IT!  ________________________  Sir William Wallace in "Braveheart" My take: If this doesn't get you ready to go to war, nothing will.    Wallace: Sons of Scotland! I am William Wallace! Scotsman: William Wallace is seven feet tall! Wallace: Yes, I've heard! Kills men by the hundreds! And if he were here, he'd consume the English with fireballs from his eyes...and bolts of lightning from his arse! (laughter) I AM William Wallace! And I see, a whole army of my countrymen, here in defiance of tyranny. You've come to fight as free men, and free men you are. What will you do with that freedom? Will you fight? Scotsman: Fight? Against that? No, we will run, and we will live. Wallace: Aye, fight and you may die. Run, and you'll live. At least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that...for one chance...just ONE CHANCE to come back here to tell our enemy that they may take out lives, but they will never take OUR FREEDOM!!!   _____________________________ Col. Jessep in "A Few Good Men"    "You want me on that wall. You need me there."  My take: How great was this? Jessep is that hard-ass coach you loved and hated at the same time.   Jessep: You want answers? Kaffee: I think I'm entitled to them.  Jessep: You want answers?!  Kaffee: I want the truth.  Jessep: You can't handle the truth!   Jessep: Son, we live in a world that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lt. Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You don't want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me there. We use words like honor, code, loyalty... we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use 'em as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it. I'd prefer you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to.  _________________________________  Terence Mann in "Field of Dreams" MY take: A speech to remember and one that was only surpassed in the movie by the line "Dad, wanna have a catch?" Guys everywhere cried much to their girlfriends/wives delight. Who says the best motivational speeches can't make you cry?   Terence Mann: Ray, people will come Ray. They'll come to Iowa for reasons they can't even fathom. They'll turn up your driveway not knowing for sure why they're doing it. They'll arrive at your door as innocent as children, longing for the past. Of course, we won't mind if you look around, you'll say. It's only $20 per person. They'll pass over the money without even thinking about it: for it's money they have and peace they lack. And they'll walk out to the bleachers; sit in shirtsleeves on a perfect afternoon. They'll find they have reserved seats somewhere along one of the baselines, where they sat when they were children and cheered they're heroes. And they'll watch the game and it'll be as if they dipped themselves in magic waters. And the memories will be so thick they'll have to brush them away from their faces. People will come Ray. The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball. America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers. It has been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt and erased again. But baseball has marked the time. This field, this game: it's a part of our past, Ray. It reminds of us of all that once was good and it could be again. Oh,.. people will come Ray. People will most definitely come.  ________________________________  Tony D'Amato in "Any Given Sunday" My take: Tough to pick just one speech from this movie -- or one Al Pacino speech from his career (Scarface, Scent of a Woman, Godfather series). But since this is tied to football, I had to go here.   Tony D'Amato: You find out life's this game of inches, so is football. Because in either game -- life or football -- the margin for error is so small. I mean, one half a step too late or too early and you don't quite make it. One half second too slow, too fast and you don't quite catch it. The inches we need are everywhere around us. They're in every break of the game, every minute, every second. On this team we fight for that inch. On this team we tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that inch. We claw with our fingernails for that inch. Because we know when add up all those inches, that's gonna make the &*#$-ing difference between winning and losing! Between living and dying!   ___________________________ Sylvester Stallone in Rocky My take: With apologies to the "Just Win" scene in Rocky II, this is the one that gets you. This is the one that keeps teams fighting even when it's 73-7. Gotta like that attitude.   Rocky: Ah come on, Adrian, it's true. I was nobody. But that don't matter either, you know? 'Cause I was thinkin', it really don't matter if I lose this fight. It really don't matter if this guy opens my head, either. 'Cause all I wanna do is go the distance. Nobody's ever gone the distance with Creed, and if I can go that distance, you see, and that bell rings and I'm still standin', I'm gonna know for the first time in my life, see, that I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood.  ______________________________  Jake and Elwood in "Blues Brothers" My take: Come on. . .You didn't think I'd leave this out did you?    Jake Blues: First you trade the Cadillac for a microphone. Then you lie to me about the band. Now you're gonna put me right back in the joint!  Elwood Blues: They're not gonna catch us. We're on a mission from God!  ___________________________________________  Jefferson Smith in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" My take: Surprised? See, I love the classics as well. If you haven't seen this one, go rent it.   Jefferson Smith: (His voice very hoarse) Just get up off the ground, that's all I ask. Get up there with that lady that's up on top of this Capitol dome, that lady that stands for liberty. Take a look at this country through her eyes if you really want to see something. And you won't just see scenery; you'll see the whole parade of what Man's carved out for himself, after centuries of fighting. Fighting for something better than just jungle law, fighting so's he can stand on his own two feet, free and decent, like he was created, no matter what his race, color, or creed. That's what you'd see. There's no place out there for graft, or greed, or lies, or compromise with human liberties. And, uh, if that's what the grownups have done with this world that was given to them, then we'd better get those boys' camps started fast and see what the kids can do. And it's not too late, because this country is bigger than the Taylors, or you, or me, or anything else. Great principles don't get lost once they come to light. They're right here; you just have to see them again!  _____________________________________  Monty Python "The Holy Grail" My take: Ah, the best of the "never say die" attitude.   King Arthur: There I've won. Black Knight: 'Tis but a scratch. King Arthur: What are you talking about, your arm's off.  Black Knight: No it isn't.  King Arthur: What do you call that then? Black night: (Pauses) I've had worse! King Arthur: You liar! Black Knight: Come on ya pansy! King Arthur: You are indeed brave, sir knight, but the fight is mine. Black Knight: Oh, had enough eh? King Arthur: Look, you stupid bastard. You've got no arms left! Black Knight: Yes I have. King Arthur: Look! Black Knight: Just a flesh wound!
