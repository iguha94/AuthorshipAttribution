WEll after that blazing post let me follow it up with a recount of yesterday(lok at the time) First, Meily, i love her. It's incredible how she makes me feel, around ehr i feel like i could conquer the world.  remind me to d.l. o sweet child of mine bby guns and roses. love that song....anyways i'm depressed. I don't know why. I love that girl!  Around her i'm all smiles...she leaves and it's like turning a light of in my mind, soul and heart.. reminds me of that otis redding song (oldie alert) ain't no sunshine when she's gone....how fukcing true. Anyways how do i feel? let's turn to staind again...first yesterday now blow away.  _______________ Blow Away- Staind  live in my head for just one day i see myself andlook away the road is showing now on my face soon i'll disappear disappear without a fucking trace  faces that i've seen turn old and grey i've lost too many freinds along the way memories i never thought would fade they fade and blow away  i wish that icould disappear  unzip my skin and leave it here so i could be no one again and never let nobody, i'd let nobody i'd never let nobody in  faces that i've seen turn old and grey i've lost too many freinds along the way memories i never thought would fade they fade and blow away  so now the walls are closing in  because in life you sink or swim sometimes these shoes don't feel right in my head feel like a book that can't be read, a book that can't be, a book that can't be read  faces that i've seen turn old and grey i've lost too many freinds along the way memories i never thought would fade they fade and blow away. _____________________  BUT WAIT!    there's always the freaks song  i guess it had to be! it's so damn me...you guys read my past (first post please...thank you)...and...well judge for yourself...staind again..."Could it be"   Well i don't know what to say because there's truth to what you say i know it kills you i'm this way there's something different every day  could it be that i never had the chance to grow inside? could it be that my habit is to find a place to hide? could it be that sometimes i say things just to disagree? could it be that i'm only being me?   not easy living in my mind a little peace is hard to find my every thought is undermined  by all the history inside   could it be that i never had the chance to grow inside? could it be that my habit is to find a place to hide? could it be that sometimes i say things just to disagree? could it be that i'm only being me?  i know i hear the words you said over and over again i just can't get them through my head there's just too many voices must be like living with the dead waiting for me to begin to do the things i have said  and for this i'm sorry so there's some truth to what you say  could it be that i never had the chance to grow inside? could it be that my habit is to find a place to hide? could it be that sometimes i say things just to disagree? could it be that i'm only being me?  ______________________________________-  ANd a song for meily of course couldn't help it   Soluna-So in Love   Like a dream, a childhood fantasy  You came to me, wiped me off my feet  Like paradise lookin' in your eyes  You take my breath away  Baby, I'm here to say   You make me feel special  You're all that I need and more  Fairytales do come true  Cuz they did when I met you   The only time I ever fell  I fell for you  Now I'm so in love  So deep in love with you  When I'm with you, I get lost in time When we're hand in hand Our dreams intertwined On and on like drifting off to sea Never ending, you're all I need  You make me feel special You're all that I need and more Fairytales do come true Cuz they did when I met you  The only time I ever fell  I fell for you  Now I'm so in love  So deep in love with you  (You make me feel special) The only time I ever fell (you're so incredible) I fell for you Now I'm so in love...
