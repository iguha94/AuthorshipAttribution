He won the last presidential election. He's the overwhelming favorite for the next presidential election. He represents a cause to millions. And he was vice president during eight years of peace and prosperity. And they tell us they have a better candidate in 2004?  We disagree. Grassroots Democrats from coast to coast believe Al Gore is the only Democrat who can represent us -- who must represent us -- in what may be the most crucial election in American history. And the only one who can win. We are asking that he reconsider his decision and run for the Democratic nomination for president. If he does not, we will draft him in 2004.   ladies and gentlemen, i invite you all to go    here    aND BY THE WAY I'M REALLY INDEPENDENT...NOT DEMOCRAT...
