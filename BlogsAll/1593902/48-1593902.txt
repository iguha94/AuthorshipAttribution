I'd do anything to make you adore me or deplore me but never ignore me.  ____________________ All of my life I've tried so hard Doing my best with what I had Nothing much happened all the same Something about me stood apart A whisper of hope that seemed to fail Maybe I'm born right out of my time Breaking my life in two ____________________  NIN- Something I Can Never Have  still recall the taste of my tears. echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears. my favorite dreams of you still wash ashore. scraping through my head 'till i don't want to sleep anymore  come on tell me. make this all go away. you make this all go away. i'm down to just to thing. and i'm starting to scare myself. make this all go away. you make this all go way  I just want something. i just want something i can never have you always were the one to show me how back then i couldn't do the things that i can do now. this is slowly take me apart. grey would be the color if i had a heart. i just want something i can never have. in this place it seems like such a same. though it all looks different now, i know it's still the same everywhere i look you're all i see. just a fading fucking reminder of who i used to be.  i just want something. i just want something i can never have i just want something i can never have think i know what you meant. that night on my bed. still picking at this scab i wish you were dead. you sweet and perry ellis. just stains on my sheets. _______________________  Staind-Epiphany  Your words to me just a whisper Your faces so unclear I try to pay attention Your words just disappear  'Cause its always raining in my head Forget all the thing's I should have said  So I speak to you in riddles because My words get in my way.
