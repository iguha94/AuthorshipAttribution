Artist:Thrice   Song: "All That's Left "   one day the dreamers died within us  when all our answers never came  we hid the truth beneath our skin but  our shadows never looked the same   a ghost is all that's left  of everything we swore we never would forget  we tried to bleed the sickness  but we drained our hearts instead  we are the dead   and when we couldn't stop the bleeding  we held our hearts over the flame  we couldn't help but call it treason  after that we couldn't fill our frames  after that our shadows never looked the same   in summers past we'd challenge fate  with higher pitch and perfect aim  and standing fast, we'd radiate  a light we loved but never named  but the answers never came  and our shadows never looked the same   a ghost is all that's left  of everything we swore we never would forget  we tried to bleed the sickness  but we drained our hearts instead  we are the dead  a ghost of everything we thought but never said  we tried to bleed the sickness  but we drained our hearts instead   we are the ones who lost our faith  we dug ourselves an early grave  we are the dead, can we be saved? ___________________________   Bond.
