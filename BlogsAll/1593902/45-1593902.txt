If you said that you could kill the things inside me  You're just a liar, everything inside me's dead  It's nice of you to think that I could ever be that  But I'm not, I'm just a failure instead   Don't preach a story of success and gifted thinking  Because in the end were gonna end up the same way  Keep on living your whole life on hands and knees  'Cause I'll be standing waiting, life ends the same way   Never wanted this life  Because it's meaningless  Gone away from me   The life you've given is a poorly painted picture  The colors running and it's staggering my life  A definition of the truth is all I wanted  Not mental beatings falling short of stupidity   Don't give a speech on your prolific ways of living  You speak in vain whether you think you do or not  Spreading infection of the truth that leads to sick lies  You are the shame inside of me, you mindrot   Never wanted this life  Because it's meaningless  Gone away from me   If you said that you could kill the things inside me  You're just a liar, everything inside me's dead  It's nice of you to think that I could ever be that  But I'm not, I'm just a failure instead   You're so mistaken on the life you think I wanted  I'll give you credit for the effort you put forth  'Cause as it ends you're gonna start to realize that  Your fuckin' prejudice and words of wisdom go unheard   Never wanted this life  Because it's meaningless  Gone away from me   Never wanted this life...
