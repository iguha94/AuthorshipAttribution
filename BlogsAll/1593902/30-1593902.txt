Lately as i feel more disconnected from people than ever the knife's loking like a salvation tool, and that's NEVER a good sign.  that said i've had enough. i feel so fucking lonely, the one person that i know would be the one to help me through everything isn't in the same fucking state, the other one that more than likely could cheer me up isn't in this continent, and then there's sofia, who even when i try to to her things they don't get through to her, the last two nights i've gone to sleep listening over and over to this song......it's been my best friend lately...you guys know it too ___________________  I will never bother you  I will never promise to  I will never follow you  I will never bother you     Never speak a word again  I will crawl away for good     I will move away from here   You won't be afraid of fear  No thought was put in to this   I always knew it would come to this  Things have never been so swell  I have never failed to fail     Pain (x3) You know you're right (x3)   I'm so warm and calm inside  I no longer have to hide  Let's talk about someone else  Steaming soup against her mouth  Nothing really bothers her  She just wants to love herself   I will move away from here  You won't be afraid of fear  No thought was put into this  I always knew to come like this   Things have never been so swell  I have never failed to fail    Pain (x5) You know you're right (x17)  Pain
