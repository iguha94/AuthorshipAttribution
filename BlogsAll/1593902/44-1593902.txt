isn't it ironic how one song can vouch for so many diffferent things? last night the song below meant for my parents, now it's for Brandy. See the whole day i felt like the third wheel, but to me her and odie, it's perfectly ok, i really don't mind with them being third wheel, it's good.  what i mind is this i'm above you temperament/attitude Odette takes to use when i have see her in person. It's like W.T.F? dude, her fucking looks she shot m once or twice and her "watch the movie not brandy ( i was looking at the cat)" shit, i felt like smacking her. She holds out on you because she considers jsut about veryone not named brandy a shit fuck, well you know what i'm sorry i'm no where near her level, but atleast i fucking TRY. as for brandy: "You know what?I can always rely on you guys", yeah but apparently I can't satisfy you nearly enough.  But w.e. you know what despite my bitchings, i'm not gonna lie i had a lot of fuking fun, i thought it was cool, though brandy's mikey and joy syndrome pissed me off. it was i wonder where they are every five secs. It was cool, it was cute to see them hugging and stuff. It was like bein back in school, with a hella lot more freedom.  then Mikey got there, that's cool i have NO fucking problems with ihm whatsoever. He's a bit too perv for me but what the hell i can stand that, he's funny. What started to anger me was teh whole let's put a potato chip on our tongue for mikey shit....i felt like puking. Then it was let's go upstairs so we can do this better, listen you chumps i paly madden for two three reasons. It's a great game and one of my passions. It releases my thoughts out of whatever is going on that's fucking me up at the moment. It's a damn good excuse to get out of w.e. it is that's going on now.  So w.e. i go down to play madden, hoping and praying nothing was going on upstairs and that the raiders didn't get the first down. They sent Mikey down, cause brandy felt bad i was alone prolly.  w.e., i woulda preffered he stayed up there, in any case they go down, annoy me and disconcentrate me. Then about 5 minutes later, they go oh can we watch a movie instead? Whatever, suit yourself....this was the tenth time we tried watching a movie cause brandy kept being impatient. The movie was as stupid as staring at a dead rat. And what odie told me when brandy left ticked me off...and playing 4th wheel didn't settle to well.  So in the end she goes don't you know how to say goodbye? me: not to you i don't **leaves**  So the future rule bcomes insttituted, unless your my friend and i've met the person online, i don't go. if it's at a mall, it's me you, and if designated and agreed to, other people.  _________________________________________________________________  I spend my time  letting these hopeless thoughts run my life  force me to hide  just create a truth to all these lies   I will never be the same  so just leave me down while i'm seperating  I could never give anymore  all these lies have left me torn   it's only this way falling on my own  I made this mess now it's over  it was nobody's fault, it was all my own  everything's wasted forever   the only hand  that I know how to hold belongs to me  how it began  what I thought was right became my insecurity   I will never be the same  so just leave me down while i'm seperating  I could never give anymore  all these lies have left me torn   it's only this way falling on my own  I made this mess now it's over  it was nobody's fault, it was all my own  everything's wasted forever   it's my own  it's my own   weakness becomes me  my faults relieve me  my fear excludes me  turns it against me  my fault  my fear  turned it against me   it's only this way falling on my own  I made this mess now it's over  it was nobody's fault, it was all my own  everything's wasted forever   it's only this way falling on my own  it's only this way falling on my own  it's only this way falling on my own  it's only this way, it's only this way   it's on my own  it's on my own
