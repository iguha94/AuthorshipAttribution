ok well last night i went ot bed crying for the third night in a row. this time it was mostly due to some things brandy said, which kept echoing in my head well, w.e., she opened up to me and i thank God for that, it was about time. Love you baby sis, and um, Carmen, preparate! And Brandy baby sis, you can call me tonight!  ____________________________________________ edit! ____ i wrote something that i really like because it sucks but it's from the heart, not mushy shit,but w.e.....first off i want to post a song that let's you know how i feel __________________________  NIN-Hurt  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel I focus on the pain the only thing that's real the needle tears a hole the old familiar sting try to kill it all away but I remember everything what have I become? my sweetest friend everyone I know goes away in the end you could have it all my empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt I wear my crown of shit on my liar's chair full of broken thoughts I cannot repair beneath the stain of time the feeling disappears you are someone else I am still right here what have I become? my sweetest friend everyone I know goes away in the end you could have it all my empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt if I could start again a million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way ____________________  "if you say you want to kill me inside your just a fucking liar everything inside me's already dead!"  I wish i could move away from here, alone maybe, perhaps with someone, Where i no longer have to hide in fear,  Where i no longer ahve to shed another tear I wish the pain from so many things  Rrom so many angles From so many places of loss  Would jsut leave.  I need someone to love me I need someone who won't turn their back on me. Need someone who won't attack me I need someone to tell me everythings gonna be fine again. I need a world in which i'm ok. I need a life and soul. I have failed all my goals  I shall die in peace, all alone My seat is freezing  The world is sleeping  As i turn slowly numb Is it truly me who's dumb Now that i found someone,  I feel all the more alone Than i ever have before I feel this damned fear of uncertainty stinging clear thorugh all my body, and mind So I cant help but ask myself how much I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer So far it has me beat To life i appeal Have you not hurt me nearly enough? Have your tentacles of hate and vulgarious death not risen? Is there a greater pain than one being terrified but by himslef? I need someone to reach down in their heart and pull out some hope for me they say nothing lasts forever even cold november rain then why is it pouring on me everyday? I feel like a ghost no one can do anything but laugh and snicker at Feel like no one relly notices me except as an impediment I've dodge their slings and arrows, misses , So damn narrow, But if they missed why do i feel shot? I'm not asking for pity and absolution, Before you come to a conclusion, just try to walk in my shoes I know you'll stumble in my footsteps, Be like me and bumble at the doorstep Fumble at the one yard line And in my life i need an addiction, to someone hooked on me What i need Is a fairy tale ending To compensate For all the shit life threw at me For all the times i fucked up For being a pain in the ass For causing pain nearly as much as i recieved it I can't be fixed But hopefully my life can and will Hopefully times will change,  And a sunny day of perfection Will allow me to show my affection
