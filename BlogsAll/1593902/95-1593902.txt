Thanks,      Susana Barciela  The Miami Herald  Editorial Board        -----Original Message----- From: Franco Caliz [mailto:franco15@msn.com] Sent: Thursday, March 04, 2004 4:04 PM To: Alberto Ibarguen Subject: A total disrespect to the families of 9/11     "As a 14 year old, I'm never taken seriously by adults. Yet exactly how is it people can say President Bush was great in 9/11 and not see how he has betrayed those very families by not giving some of them one third of what he promised.   The latest clear example of politics being his major concern in life and not the well being of America is how he once promised families of 9/11 that he would never involve them in politics,as well as he shouldn't because the event was perhaps the single biggest event in American history. President Bush stated "I have no ambition whatsoever to use this as a political issue." That raises the question; why is it that he has involved images of the World Trade Center in one ad, and in another using the funeral of a firefighter? Have you noticed that the Republican Convention just so happens to be in the first week of September, near the third anniversary of the attacks.     To me it seems like Sen. Kerry is not the only one flip flopping.         Sincerely,  Franco Caliz"
