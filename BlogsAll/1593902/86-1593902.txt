I am registered as a Democrat or Republican. Must I register without party affiliation to be a nonpartisan candidate?   No. Any registered elector may have his name placed on the ballot at the general election without party affiliation (Section 99.0955(1), F.S.).   Must I appoint a campaign treasurer and designate a depository before I make public my intention to run for office?   No. Section 106.021, F.S., provides that a person must appoint a treasurer and designate a depository prior to qualifying for office, obtaining petitions, accepting contributions or making expenditures. Nothing in this section prohibits a person from announcing his intention to become a candidate prior to appointing a treasurer, so long as no expenditures are made in connection with that announcement and no contribution is received.
