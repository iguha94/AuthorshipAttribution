Hello. Welcome to the world of da Freak. who is Freak? He is in reality OcnarF ZilaC.  He is now headed to towards his freshman year. He is a foolish, pathetic human. A hopeless romantic. He tries to please. He fails miserably. And it really and truly affects him.      He is a world of lies. He has no friends...and if he does, he is sure to lose them soon. He is a loner, always has been and until resently he cared not what anyone gave a fuck.   For the first two grades life was dandy. class president. grade representative. leader of everyone. loved by everyone. Then life took it's first twist on him.  Made him move. from 3-7th grade he was despised.  But first in 6th grade his life was changed forever. Fell for the fierst real time for a girl.  Fell hard. Fell fast.  And so it was. Went well long enough. 9 months of joy, happiness. Then came May 16, 2000. His love. His first grandiouse savior. Betrayed him.  Paid 100$ 6 people came up with a world of lies. His bestfriend would not lie.  His enemies did.  His love did.  They claimed he had stated he wanted to blow himself up and kill all jewish (whom he likes) and Catholics which he is one. He was forced out of Doral Academy Charter School. The day before his birthday. On his birthday he registered in his new school. Then came West Miami Middle School. The Falcons.  He had 16 days to fit in, learn a new system. To catch up on all the shit he hadn't learned in Doral Academy.  All 6 months of which he had lost.  It seemed impossible.  But in what became known as the "Miraculous Justice". And as a testament to his two brain cells he passed all his classes. With an A. The counselor called it "the luckiest most incredible thing she had seen in her 25 years of counseling."    But last year has changed his life. He was backstabbed in a way no one could predict. And thus he hid in an illusionary world. He hid in himself, threw a "front" , a character at people.  Hid in a world of cold-heartedness. Threw out an iron face at the world and hid in himself. Then he was rescued. A minor ray of light came through. He wanted to give her the world.  But in many a ways he never got the chance. She was nothing more than his false messiah.  He fought in vain. Gained nothing but pure pain. Soraya was a failure.  It represented his life perfectly. It had begun well enough and had since become a shell of what it was.  8th grade began.  He then earned the one best thing of his life. His first true friend.  Brandy Sky Martinez...a name of poetic firm and a character of incredible charm. She kept him alive in his harshest moments.  A year in which he was atleast finally semi-accepted in the school. One which he is proud to say he was not the loner he was used to being.  But he remains anti-social.  He heads to highschool knowing this. There are now people who care about him. But he will never open up as easily as he had before. He will not show his weaknesses in the home of the Rams.  Coral Park will be his shining point. He will keep his old friends. He will make new acquaintences. But he will not let people know the truth about anything. He will be cold. He will not feel like this on the inside.  But he will not be hurt by people again. He refuses to let this happen. He will show compassion to some. To the rest he will not succumb. And he will not make anyone a permanent resident of his heart. Unless their already in it. He is ready....and those whom he trust. the few. the losers.  Will be linked here. It will be his only source of telling people what he really feels and thinks. And he will not go through another Soraya. Another Anne Marie. He will never again be hurt. Quote the Raven nevermore. _____________________________________________________________ Initial Readers will be Meily, Brandy (of course), Laura, Kathy, Carmen, Sofy.
