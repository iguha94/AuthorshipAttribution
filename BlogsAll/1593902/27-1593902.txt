i got home expecting my inbox to say this "BYE" form meily..and it came true....but it wasn't the type of bye i expected...i expected a break up letter, let's jsut say that wasn't what i got, i have about a million things to say and i got all my paranoia back....but this is all i'm saying for now...i'm angry. i'm very angry. and i'm hurt. because she didn't have the balls (guts) to go and tell me the truth straight out. no she came up with a zillion bullshit lies, excuses, and she's playing games, and now i don't know what to do...but you know what i'm fucked up the ass either way and why's that? because i fucking love her, and it'd kill me to see her go.  So Meily, if you want to we can stay together, because i'm willing to....but right now you lost a whole lot of trust. You know, or atleast i hope you do, that you could have told me the damned truth, and you know what the saddest part or thing is? that i knew basic. exactly what was going on, and actually i was about to tell my baby sister last night you two were prolly dating.  that fucking makes me so damn angry, honey, tell me the truth, always, as i would and as i DO. Not some cockamanie bullshit lies.  and one last question exactly what did he do that made you "Realize" this?  i'm not sure whether i'm the rebound or whether i'm a new one....i know i'll never match up to him, but damnit i'm gonna try if you let me...but it's always and all up to you...night to all, and Sofy, don't you   EVER   invite me to the mall again...unless i can take someone (a la carmen)
