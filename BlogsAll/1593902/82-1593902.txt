         I need a strategy for this one and i'm not thinking in the right frame of mind, i feel like killing someone, anyone and there's not muhc (sofia) holding me back from killing myself...not a good show, but i won't, because i'm angry and i'll be strapped to apole and ass fucked by micheal jackson before i die angry.  I think me and Elga are correct, i shouldn't have to stand this shit from Brandy everytime she likes a different guy, and yet again i go on this stupid shit angry because 1. she won't listen 2. i know i'm right and 3. she decides to put the other person over me. She did it with piggy, mike, and now esteban, and i won't stand for it, i won't let this one happen again. I've heard some cgruesome crap abuot this asshole and i shall never let her date this one. By then i will have beaten him to a pulp of his life and i will put a bullet through my sad pathetic little brain. I'm pissed as few times before, because i'm back to where i was in 8th in many ways...I'm ignoring Brandy, i'm ignoring Naty, and i'm barely talking to odie, that's the set of action i've decided to uptake for now, ni fact i think i'm jsut going to block brandy out from anything in general. The faster i get rid of ehr the better, her memory is quickly turning this into a mini anne, and a mini soraya, i'm headed for that path and i won't let it. funny how the people i care the msot about go away, mostly because of some shit fuck ...... error?.....Money,  Distance and in this one Distance/Personality. I love her but i could give a shit now.  Odette and me are maybe as lose as ever before, i need tos eperate from there too, and I have to find a new set, a better one than i had before, judging as how i've spent two years over seeing this people, three somewhat looking out for Brandy and i get treated like some fourth class bitch? I shall not allow it. change is neccessary. It has begun
