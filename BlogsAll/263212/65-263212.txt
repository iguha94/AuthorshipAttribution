  						    Freaky Tattoos  At 2 am this morning, while getting ready for bed, I realized my bookbag was in Donna's locked car.  How convenient?  I only really wanted my notebook, who needs those schoolbooks?  I had trouble getting to sleep, but while I was in the process my mind ran Olympic marathons.  Twice when I came to consciousness I grabbed a pen from atop the mini-fridge beside me and wrote notes on my arm, much like  Memento .     1. Remember  Taxi   -I loved this show.  I used to stay up to watch it all the time.  Now that it only airs on TV Land, another station this town doesn't get,I have been deprived of that viewing privilege.  It deserves a place in my top 5.  Sorry,  Early Edition  you've got to go.    2. We're like sawdust .-  It's a concept I plan to incorporate into a poem.  It seems we're the wood that is being cut, but rather we are the sawdust that falls to the ground.  The sawdust is collected time after time and something great is done with it.  The cutting is equivalent to the trials and tribulations of our lives.  It may seem our problems are mere splinters, but instead, they are gigantic timbers.  When God cuts that away there isn't much left sometimes.  3. Dream:Ms. Piggy and Kermit -I was Kermit.  I was chasing the pig around trying to explain something to her.  I couldn't talk very clear because my head was clogged up.  I woke to find my face smushed into the pillow.  My dreams went on to be equally bizarre.
