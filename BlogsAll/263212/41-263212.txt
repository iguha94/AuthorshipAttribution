  						    Long Lost Friend  So I'm home for Father's day.  On the kitchen table I found a notebook that I thought I had lost.  My Dad must have found it when he was going through some more stuff.  I haven't known where it was since two summers ago.  That whole summer I counted down because at the end of it I was transferring to   B.C.F.  and moving to Graceville, Florida.  I had been anxiously wanting to go there for a few years.  Anyway, somehow in the process of moving from my apartment to my parents' house to the dorm the notebook was misplaced.  I'm glad we have been reunited.  It scares me to think that many pages of my stuff might just be floating around somewhere someone might possibly read it.  Especially stuff from those darker ages.  Looking through this there is, to my surprise, a few poems I like.  Here is one:  Magnets  climb down to the impound lot connect the wires, the wires are hot this disease is all I got so don't display affection It's okay to not have direction I understand my affliction Yeah, all my candles are lit But I'm biting the bit And the voices in me throw a fit If I were magnetic north Then You would be the same north because however we got opposite force you look and look and hope for a clue how did you know I was talking to You?  in a force field of first sight glances and a crowd of us begging for dances you act like your some kinda princess  (ok, so I don't entirely get it either)
