  						    Trampoline Angel  My brother got a trampoline for his tenth birthday on Monday.  I've gotten into going out and jumping on it.  I think I like it more than he does.  Tuesday afternoon it had been raining.  I went out to find a still semi-wet trampoline.  I could jump, just not as well.  I was in a wacky mood as I often am.  I laid down.  I don't know what got into me, but I started moving my arms....as if...as if i were making a trampoline angel.  "Oh my," I realized "I think I've invented something.  Anyway this afternoon I went back out there.  I carried my Bible and notebook.  I set them on the edge and laid down.  I closed my eyes and started my prayer.  In no time at all I was asleep again.  I dreamed I was praying.  I woke up and spoke a few more words only to fall back out.  The memory of it is all a blur really.  At some point my dad came out to see if I was alright.  Then I sat up and began writing in my notebook.  I journal excessively, so I was going to write a little summation of thoughts and concerns before starting the prayer.  That ended up being 6 pages long.  At the conclusion it dawned on me that this had been a time of prayer.  I feel like I was getting somewhere with it.  In my next post I am going to share with you some excerpts from those six pages.
