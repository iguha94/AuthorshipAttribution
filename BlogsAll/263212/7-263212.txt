  						    Claire   I'm home.  I've been here longer than originally planned but I am going back tomorrow.  Today: the dentist.  Tomorrow: My five month old niece.  Any guesses which day I was looking forward to most?  Claire.  For the last time it's not Addison, her first name, it's Claire.  I hate that I have to stay at the dorm two weeks to a month without seeing her.  She's growing up fast.  Then again, that is what they do.  Tonight I asked my mom when she'll get teeth.  Then I said,"Cause it all goes downhill from there.  Soon as they can bite it's not fun anymore."  I don't mean that, obviously, but I can't imagine her growing up.  I can't imagine her growing up and being conceited, rude, angry or sad.  But, there's that chance.  I can barely imagine her talking, much less, fussing and fighting her parents.  She can't walk yet, but one day she will.  I can't imagine her storming out of a room enraged or tearful.  But, this will happen.  Unless, she holds it all inside.  I can't imagine anyone hurting her.  I know better though.  That's what the world does, hurt.  I,at least hope not to hurt her.  I know somehow I'll let her down.  That's what people do to each other.  I can only pray that with God's help I can be a positive impact in her life.  Now, I will define growing up differently.    Most people just float from birth to death and never grow up.  Growing up is not how pop culture portrays it, with adults staunch and jaded.  Growing up is taking responsibility, none of this making excuses.  Growing up is doing more than asked and being more than expected.  It's being a stumbling block to the stale ways of living for a withering world.  It's living for a risen savior, Jesus.  He is the only life. I want to grow up.  I want to watch Claire grow up.  I pray God would let me have some part, even an insignificant one, in her meeting Him.
