  						    Living Arrangements   No one wants to room with me, or so it seems.  Friend A lives off campus and recently his roommate moved out.  He told me he wanted to live by himself.  Friend B fears it would be a detriment to our friendship.  I believe he's put thought into this.  I understand his fear.  It is legitimate.  Still, I would be challenged to work whatever out.  Friend C seemed to be my greatest prospect before.  He was going to move into my room.  I've lived in this room for right at two years.  I really would feel awkward moving out, save I was moving off campus entirely.  He decided he wants to stay in his room.  I understand, but his now roommate will probably stay there with him.  Friend D said Friend A said to him,"Was there ever any doubt you could move in here?"  Friend A obviously doesn't mind sacrificing living by himself in order to live with Friend D.  How am I supposed to feel?  Next semester truckloads of new students will fill the dorms.  There will be no more of this 'room to myself' as I've been so fortunate to have.  Some unlucky sap will be forced to live with me.  I have to wonderi if I'm that hard to get along with or if I smell or something.
