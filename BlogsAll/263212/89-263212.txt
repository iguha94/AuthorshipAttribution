  						    Grace for The Prodigal  Seven Advil are scattered on the deskspace in front of me.  I think of how were it not for grace I'd have a headache.  It's not that I don't deserve one.  I don't eat right.  I don't get enough sleep.  I don't even keep up with all my medicine.  I should expect a headache.  I've only set myself up for that.  Instead, I think backwards, I get upset when my head hurts.  To be more grateful, that is my prayer. Recently I was talking to a friend.  We talked about the mistakes of our past and how without God's grace we'd have even more to regret.  This friend felt so undeserving as to want to give up all that God had given.  God enabled me to comfort my friend with His love, with His truth.  I said, "That's what grace is.  It's a gift.  To some degree we decide what we do with it, but its a gift."  This conversation reminded me of something: I believe in grace.  There hasn't been a time that I would have told you differently, but too often we don't live as we believe; we don't believe as we live. It was a very beautiful moment between me, my friend and our Savior.  So August wasn't such a great month.  I didn't go to a single church service.  I've been a prodigal.  At the close of this conversation I told this friend that it felt like I was about to make contact with God (or the other way around).   After praying tonight, out by the lake, I really believe that I'm reuniting with the Father.
