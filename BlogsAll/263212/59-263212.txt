  						    Mind Gargling  After a little over 12 hours of sleep, I woke up this morning, I mean afternoon,at 1:16.  This from a guy who sleeps four hours a day, usually.  Yesterday I got spacers put on my teeth.  I wonder if   Pop Tarts  are okay to eat?  My teeth hurt.   Hard Candy  is on shelves today.  I'm just waiting for a ride to the store now.  Maybe I should have stayed home until today.  My parents would have been more than glad to run me by   Wal-Mart .  Jed asked me why I couldn't just get it from   BMG .  I was like, "Because I'd have to wait 6 or 7 months.  Some cds I buy right when they come out."  I also said that if BMG had it right now, and I could get it in a couple weeks, that I might would go that route.  But, you and I both know I don't want to wait that long.  I'm using the computer lab.  It closes in 5 minutes.  I get disappointed when I come in here, log on to   AIM express  and no one is on.   Of course, lately I don't know how to talk to people when they are.  This is my randomness for now.  More later...
