  						    Mr. Sandman   Today is three and a half hours old.  I reflect on the day behind me.    12:30 departure for Destin  2:30 arrival, go out on beach  3:00 go out into the ocean, get caught in the undertow, survive  3:45 go back, not going down without a fight  4:30 laying on the beach, asleep/awake  5:00 back in the water  6:00 walk down the beach toward the sunset  6:30 seashore chat  8:15 leave beach, go to eat  9:00 begin trek home  11:30 got back, shower, 'wore slap out'  Today  12:30 depart for wal-mart  1:30 home again, sit in car and talk  2:00 go inside exhausted  2:05 found Jed, talked to him  2:45 Jeff and Sean got back from Waffle House  2:50 tried to write on here  3:52 decided I've been up way too long  I heard the Moulin Rouge soundtrack three times and A Walk to Remember's, twice.  I played numerous cd's and countless songs were sung.  I spent near 12 hours with the same group of people.  I spent 3.15 on two double stacks, a fry, and a water.   I made two trips to Wal-Mart.  I ate most of two bags of peach rings.  I said, "what?!", about 30 or 40 times.  I took a roll of film up and started a new one.  I heard reference to too many secrets and inside jokes that I'm out on.  I learned new things and heard new stories from a close friend.  I educated this friend as well.  I had a few deeper conversations.  I listed out top five  best and worst days of the semester.  This day would have made the list had not the semester already been over.  I wrote one blog and saw there was no one left to say goodnight to,   goodnight.
