  						    Vague  I talk.  I'm not sure what I'm saying.  I feel.  I don't know what these emotions mean.  These posts where I am most vague are backed by the greatest weight of heart and mind.  The guy I've called best friend since eighth grade is getting married today.  Circumstances are tragic.  The plans were made last minute and I found out too late.  There's no way I could have gotten to Kentucky for it.  Little things get in my way.  My class at 10.  My lack of funds.  I was going to be his best man, but even if I could have gotten there it would have been extremely difficult to get a tux.  I regret my absence.  We swore nothing would get in the way of our friendship.  I guess we all grow up.  I've been praying for him for a few years now because, you see, he's been a prodigal too.  But, I think he's really getting it together this time.  I think he's home.  He's turned things around.  I thank God for that.  Let's prepare the fatted calf.  This isn't even what was on my mind when I started.  I recognize this is supposed to feel bad, but at best effort I can only be mellodramatic.  What's on my mind now is me.  How I feel and how I regret feeling like this.  How I feel trapped between a rock and a hard place or a viscious circle.  I want to hug a friend all day in fear that everything will change.  I don't want her to become someone I wave to from across a room.  I don't want our friendship to ever be past tense.  Still, I feel as though I do not have much choice.  Feeling better or even differently is a hope easily shattered.  This next big thing could hurt even more, while bringing less joy.  It's not just feelings.  I know this.  I don't want it to be that I'm jumping from rock to rock.  I'm heading back home for the weekend.  Perhaps it will do me good.  Maybe I'll come back with a new vigor.
