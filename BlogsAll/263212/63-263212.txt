  						    My City of Ruins   In response to 9/11 Springsteen penned this heartfelt declaration of hope.  I think today is a good day to think about what he has written here.This song makes me wonder if perhaps the Boss has found Jesus.  Either way this rings true to the Christian's prayer that our nation will fall to it's face and repent.   This is a prayer for our fallen brothers and sisters.   There is a blood red circle on the cold dark ground and the rain is falling down The church door's thrown open I can hear the organ's song, but the congregation's gone  My city of ruins My city of ruins  Now the sweet bells of mercy drift through the evening trees, young men on the corner like scattered leaves, the boarded up windows, the empty streets While my brother's down on his knees  My city of ruins My city of ruins  Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up! Come on, rise up!  Now's there's tears on the pillow, darlin' where we slept and you took my heart when you left Without your sweet kiss my soul is lost, my friend Tell me how do I begin again?  My city's in ruins My city's in ruins  Now with these hands, with these hands, with these hands, I pray lord With these hands, with these hands, I pray for the strength, Lord With these hands, with these hands, I pray for the faith, Lord We pray for your love, Lord We pray for the lost, Lord We pray for this world, Lord We pray for the strength, Lord We pray for the strength, Lord  Come on Come on Come on, rise up Come on, rise up Come on, rise up Come on, rise up Come on, rise up Come on, rise up Come on, rise up Come on, rise up Come on, rise up Come on, rise up
