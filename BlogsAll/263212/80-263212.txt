  						    My Annie   words and music by Craig's Brother   Darling I want to make the word "love" new cause it's been said so many times  And I don't want to use that old pick up line  And oft' I try to find the words to use but none capture the way I feel  When I gaze at your smile it seems like I'm out flying a sunset skyline  You've stolen my eyes, I stare at what I can't describe. I guess I tried   Look in my eyes. It's not hard to realize I'm the one who loves you  And though you'll never know my heart, my complete feelings  Just know you'll never be alone   Words keep cluttering in my mind as I persist in this futility  But no vocabulary could ever represent the beauty I see  You're everything and more than I could want you to be  And in your face what do I see?   It's like a rainbow in my mind, like when the daylight starts to die  Just like a landscape catching rain or like a snow glazed mountain face  Like Charlie Chaplin, like clapping one hand, my love cannot be heard  And all those love songs, they come out all wrong cause there's just no such word, my Annie   Look in my eyes. It's not hard to realize I'm the one who loves you  And though you'll never know my heart, my full emotion  Just know you'll never be alone, my Annie
