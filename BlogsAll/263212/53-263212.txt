  						    Re-entry  I've been detached far too long.  I've been detached.  I've been apathetic.  I was looking forward to the return of some friends, but felt distant from most people.  My plan was to stay as far away as possible, to isolate myself.  I felt so separated from almost everyone at school.  I didn't think I could get enough space.  My plan was to shut my mouth and become a mystery.  I didn't want to try and be close with people it felt were so far away.  These thoughts weren't entirely irrational.  To some extent I am going in a different direction.  I don't love the campus life, the inanity, the loudness,and the predictable randomness of it all.  But neither is it like me to stay away.  There's something about this campus life that draws me in.  There's something about it that I do like, something that keeps me coming back.  Maybe it's those occassions that I relate to someone.  Maybe its when we rise above the prescribed immaturity and relativism that I enjoy the atmosphere the most.  I wasn't all that excited about everyone getting back, but something happened.  I'm really not sure exactly what happened.  It's not that I can't explain it, I just don't remember it.  I was sitting there thinking yesterday and I realized how I feel now.  It was so strange.  Maybe I worked it out in my sleep.  Actually, the more I think about it I have an answer.  A friend and I resolved some things the night before.  I didn't feel as distant from her anymore.  I guess maybe all my fear stemmed from what was wrong.  What a relief, God worked this out.  I'm still a little weary about how things might be.  I can't tell you it's all going to be alright, but like I told her,"I'm trying."  Before I didn't even want to try.  God works wonders.
