  						    The Clock on the Wall pt. 2  On May 15th I wrote 'The Clock on the Wall'.  I said, "this summer feels like a hyphen.  It's like spring and fall are one word.  I can't know what that word is until the second half is written."  Toward the end of July that started to not feel true.  But now I've returned to those same feelings.  I wait in anticipation wondering what the word will be.  I await the great unveiling.  Things are coming together.  My life is being pieced together a little more all the time.  Some things that I expected became true, others that I didn't even predict happened.   I also said, "The summer is like a movie that I really want to see, but don't feel like watching now. I am all too aware that it is a movie.  As the scenes play before me I become part of it.  The distinguishing lines of the screen fade.  I no longer notice the unending ticking of the clock on the wall."  All in all this was true as well, but some parts really dragged on.   I continued, "In the fall I will ramble on about the things that summer showed me.  I'll share these lessons with anyone who will listen and some who won't."  This part I have to admit is not true.  While I will say I learned a lot, I don't feel the need to tell most people.  I'm not even going to write it here.  Openness is something I came to understand more clearly.  Keeping to myself is not weakness.  It's the inability to open up that is weakness.  I've come to understand who I am and who I want to be.  Things are looking up.  I have a feeling that things are going to run a lot smoother than they've been running.  I've been wrong before, but I just have a good clean feeling about the upcoming semester.  People ask me if I'm excited about school starting back.  I tell them I'm indifferent.   It'll be good, but it'll still be school.  And that's life.
