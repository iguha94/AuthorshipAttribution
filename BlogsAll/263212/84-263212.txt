  						    One of Those Days  some days love seems possible possible to be breathed to be learned even returned but no not for me. not her. not now. there's just no way she's out of my league I'm lame and often a jerk she's too good for me it would never work the fireworks wait in the box and the matches are in my pocket I'm ready to watch our sky light up look back at me let me believe  some days love seems possible possible to be breathed to be learned even returned she lays her head on the back of the chair what I'd give to touch her hair for her to care the others they must see me for once happy extremely I bounce down the hall.  ready to fall. not apart but into a heart together with her I'm ready to fall down ten flights I wouldn't feel a thing,'cept alright I want to be laughed at for my clown smile put that on file under new experiences she wears glasses to read she gets into this I can't help but exist and love it hold me back  some days love seems possible possible to be breathed to be learned even returned this is one of those days I look you over.  over and over again my smile hangs down my chin you make me look silly but I'm much too happy to care today some days love seems possible even inevitable unescapable like I'm tied down to train tracks It's too late for me I'd never go back but friends, I ask you, don't worry about me I'm being buried by the joy this is no near-death experience I've never lived like this never existed This is the first day of my life and I like the world so far
