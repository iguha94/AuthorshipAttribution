  						    Afternoon Report and Rambling   "I'm against picketing, but I don't know how to show it."-Mitch Hedberg  I'm excited about the summer.  I am going to spend a lot of time with God in prayer and Bible study.  I am going to get my head cleared of the chaos we so affectionately refer to as Spring 2002.  I am dedicating myself to do a lot of reading.  I have the notion to get a prayer group started of the guys who will be left in the dorm.  I've been given the responsibility of leading such a group this semester.  Boy, have I fail miserably.  We've met once.  I look forward to the pictures that I will take.  I plan on getting back into a regular regimine of running and walking.  I can't wait to arrive in August and see how for once I lived up to resolutions that I made.  I have a church evaluation due Thursday.   I did a paper my first semester here that should suffice.  I have another paper due on Monday.  This one is about my personal philosophy of leadership.  Tuesday, I have a paper for Church Recreation about how First Place can lead church members to a stronger relationship with Christ, by offering the nutrition and exercise plan that people are looking for.  I'm not too hyped up about this one.  This weekend a cousin of mine is getting married.  So Friday afternoon, my family and I will venture to the land of Atlanta, Georgia.  I need to get as much work as possible complete before shipping out.  In a few minutes I am going by student services in hopes of getting a job.  I really need one.  Maybe, I could fill that opening in the bookstore.   I really like my post,  The Music of The 20th Century , and am tempted to go on strike until 47 people comment on it.  Don't test me!!!  I am kidding(or am I???).   I'm possibly going to host   To Whom It May Concern , the site that Jeff, Justin and I write for.  I just need to find out if I have enough space.    By the way, Lori, how come you never called back?
