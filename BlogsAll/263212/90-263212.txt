  						    Down with the Pope  For the record I'm cool with celebrating both Halloween and Reformation Day.  I may not be reformed but I'm a fan of the reformation.  I'm not of the tulipsian persuasion but I recognize that this is a day we should be very thankful for.  We'd all still be stuck in that crazy glass bubble if Martin Luther hadn't found his hammer.    Getting to the point...  It was quite an enjoyable day.    Rich  came by at eleven and asked me if  I'd have lunch with him.  That was really nice of him.  It was a good start to the day for I was only then getting out of the bed.  At lunch we marvelled at his Martin Luther Bobble Head doll compliments of Jessica.  Rich got tons of people to pose with Marty.  One guy was afraid to touch Marty and ran from the cafeteria screaming.  Others, held  him tightly and proclaimed the doll their very own idol.  A good time was had by all.  Oh, and as if that weren't enough I got to go to classes afterward.  After classes I went to the doctor.  The lady that took my blood was costumed as dracula.   That was fun.  So was the shot.  Then I went to the mall.  At   Wherehouse  I discovered the grand return of the three for five dollar section.  It's back and better than ever.  It had been gone for a month.  I thought it was gone for good.  I'm happy its not.  I love collecting music.  One last thing... Happy 2 year blog-iversary to   Dead Yet Living .  Not sure when the exact date on that was just know its sometime in October.  Later.
