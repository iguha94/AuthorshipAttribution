  						    Six Day Weekend  Here I sit in my old bedroom at my parents house, 2:14 am.  I should have gone to sleep already.  Since I haven't I'm considering skipping class tomorrow and having myself a six day weekend(Tuesday is a library day).    What's also great about Tuesday is that Hard Candy will be in stores.  Counting Crows have a few   TV  appearances set in honor of the release.    Speaking of Adam and his lively bunch of Rain Kings, Leila is also a Counting Crows fan.  She runs a nice operation, a blog if you will, called   The Rantings of Little Bear .  It was an honor to discover she had linked me.  I went on to read her site and liked what I read.  Actually, my thought was more like, "I think I'm in love."  I mean, she's funny, she writes well, she's Christian and she likes Counting Crows, everything I've been looking for.  Well, I wouldn't call it love, but I do link her now.    Rhesa from   Creative Slips  has linked me now as well.  She's got Eye Level as site of the week, how awesome is that?  Thank you, Rhesa!  I like what I read over there too.  So she gets a link.  I'm just so excited she linked me I don't know what to say.  Be sure to read for yourself.    Also, I've added a link to Greg Boyd's   Christus Victor Ministries .  Dr. Freeman gave me a copy of Boyd's book,  God of the Possible .  It's good stuff.    This screen blinds me, so goodnight.
