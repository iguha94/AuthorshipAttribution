  						    Six Degrees   Tonight Donna went to a free clinic to get her foot fixed.  For a couple of weeks it has been hurting her.  They think it might be something messed up with the muscles in her foot.  They think they can fix this.  I hope so.  I hope that she doesn't have to stay off of her feet for long, if at all.    This is my twentieth post on this blog.  I think I'm going to make myself excited over this, cause it doesn't look like my hit counter is going to skyrocket anytime soon.  I wish people would comment.  I can't change the world.    I only have half of the opening paragraph for that paper that is due tomorrow.    I let Chaz borrow my copy of  High Fidelity , another great Cusack flick.  He wants to test out the DVD drive on his computer.  He's actually not sure the capability exists.    Justin, TR and I were playing 'Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon'.  That's an awesome game.  The concept is basic.  The object is to connect a named actor, et cetera to Kevin Bacon in as few moves as possible.  Any actor's name can be put in place of Kevin, but it's not technically the same game if you do that.     EX: Robin Wright Penn- Kevin Bacon  One possible solution:  Robin Wright Penn starred in  Forrest Gump  with Tom Hanks who starred in  Apollo 13  with Kevin Bacon.    Now you try:Chevy Chase-Kevin Bacon.  Give it a shot, chief!
