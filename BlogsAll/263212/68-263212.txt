  						    Lost at Sea   words and music by Craig's Brother   Floating like driftwood  Enslaved by the sea  Resolutely refusing to die  Without amnesty   Hes tossed by the waves  Hes all out of flares  Nobody saves  Nobody cares  Dehydrated lips speak words of despair  In unanswered prayer  Amidst a sea of words  He only hears the sound of sea birds  Who only whisper of a world beyond the waves  And all those points of light  The gently winking stars of night  Not out of sight but still his eyes are glazed  And though his eyes perforate the horizon  He still can't find escape from his world  He lifts his head in unwanted motion  But he can't see himself tonight  Just broken starlight  And waves   Stupid and headstrong  She stands on the beach  Shes calling his name out  But he doesn't hear her voice from where  His vessel so small  Boats bullied by waves  To nowhere at all  Dehydrated lips speak words of despair  In unanswered prayer  Amidst a sea of words He only hears the sound of sea birds  Who only whisper of a world beyond the waves  And all those points of light  The gently winking stars of night  Not out of sight but still his eyed are glazed   Keep calling his name  Keep calling perhaps he'll hear you  Keep calling his name  Maybe now he's not the one   The one whos exiled form the world of you and me  The one who can't be reached the one who's lost at sea  The one whose social skills have gone to atrophy  The one who drifts apart the one who's lost at sea  The one whos lost at sea.   Floating like driftwood.
