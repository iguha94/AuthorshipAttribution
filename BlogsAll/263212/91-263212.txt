  						    Mitch Hedberg  Twice before I've posted a joke from Mitch Hedberg (  Exhibit A ,   Exhibit B ).  At least twice daily, I get a   hit  from someone looking him up.  Last week I realized that in one of the post I mispelled his name, placing a 'u' where the second 'e' should be.  I went back and corrected that, but then realized that it's the incorrect spelling people are finding me by.  This presents a moral dilemma.   Integrity:  The man deserves to have his name spelled correctly.  It's only proper to fix it.    Complete Lack Thereof...:  But if those people are looking for Mitch Hedburg that's what I'll give 'em.  Besides, I'd hate to miss out on this wealth of hits.    Beautiful Compromise:  Correct the spelling, but add into the post an explanation that H-e-d-b-u-r-g is not the way its spelled.  This way they learn how to spell, his name and honor are defended and I still get in on those crazy hits.  Everyone wins.    This is the best compromise ever.   Appropriate Joke : "My girlfriend's name is Lynn, but my old girlfriend's name is Lyn too, except she only spells it with one 'n'.  Every now and then I mess up and call my new girlfriend by my old girlfriend's name and she can tell cause I don't go,'nnn' as long."    Official Site
