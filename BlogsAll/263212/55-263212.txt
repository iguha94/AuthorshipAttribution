  						    Senseless Titles  I knew I didn't want to go home this weekend.  That was about all I knew.  Me and a few of the boys went to   Wendy's .  This has been an off and on tradition.  People laughed with me and felt sorry for me after reading my shirt, "My hair is this color because I ate paint chips as a child."  One girl believed it and said, "God bless you."  People these days, humorous creatures.  I mixed more warm salty water in the bathroom.  We were discussing mid-life crises.  I piped up, "No one knows when their mid-life is until their dead."  Everyone laughed.  I like to make people laugh.  Sometimes I'm on a roll, as Justin    told me I was today.  I live for these days.   We went to Liverpool records after eating. Then Travis told us he has extra tickets for an event in Pensacola called   Gracefest .    The Waiting  will play at 8.  The tickets are free, courtesy of Travis.  I don't think I feel like being outside, or out at all, but there's no way I could turn down this chance to see a band I enjoy so thouroughly.  Train leaves the station at 10:30 in the morning.  I'm excited.    Something to blog about, perhaps even an adventure.
