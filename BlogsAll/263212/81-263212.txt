  						    The Enchanting Wizard of Rhythm  Walking across the field behind the cafeteria after classes this afternoon I sang to myself as usual.   Sissyneck   from Beck's  Odelay  was the song in my throat.  I hadn't listen to that particular album for some time.  Immediately I knew what I'd be playing once back in the room.    Odelay  was the first cd that I ever bought.  It's an amazing 51 minutes of music, but since I'm no music writer I'll quote someone who is.  Odelay fuses the disparate strands of Beck's music  folk, country, hip-hop, rock & roll, blues, jazz, easy listening, rap, pop  into one dense sonic collage. Songs frequently morph from one genre to another, seemingly unrelated genre  bursts of noise give way to country songs with hip-hop beats, easy listening melodies transform into a weird fusion of pop, jazz, and cinematic strings; it's genre-defying music that refuses to see boundaries  .-S.T. Erlewine, All Music Guide    When I looked this up I learned that his latest,  Sea of Change  comes out tomorrow.  After reading   this  I'm pumped.    If, on most albums prior to this, Beck's music was a sonic kaleidoscope  each song shifting familiar and forgotten sounds into colorful, unpredictable combinations  this discards genre-hopping in favor of focus, and the concentration pays off gloriously, resulting in not just his best album, but one of the greatest late-night, brokenhearted albums in pop  .-Erlewine   I'm not sure I'll be getting    Demolition   tomorrow as planned afterall.  Maybe I've had enough Ryan Adams for now.
