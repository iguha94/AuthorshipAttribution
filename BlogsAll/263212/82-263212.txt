  						    The Pepsi Man is Loud.  It's 8:26.  I have a class at nine that I would really really really like to skip.  I should be getting ready,but I'd rather be idle at least for the moment.   I bought a new cd last night.  It's Whiskeytown's most recent release,  Pneumonia .  This is the band that Ryan Adams fronts.  This is the third album of Ryan's music I've acquired this year.  The fourth will be in my hands in   5 more days .  I've yet to listen to  Pneumonia .  I was late when I got back from the store and now the first time I've really had to listen to it, my roommate is asleep.  It will have to wait.    When I got in early this morning I logged on for awhile and discovered   Mosaic Life .  Brandon and Wendy have discontinued their individual blogs and started this one together.  If it weren't for them I wouldn't know the word conflation.  Laying in my bed this morning adjusting to the concept of a new day, there was this harsh banging coming from the hall.  I wondered which pretentious jerk/resident was making this God-awful noise.  I walked out into the hall to find the Pepsi man at the vending machine.  Does it really require all that racket to load this machine up?  Anyway it seemed excusable.  Another resident,Nathan, had had the same idea as me.  He said he wondered who's butt he was going to have to kick...thinking it was some punk kid.  He said,"I can't kick the Pepsi man's butt."    I could, its just a little early for it.
