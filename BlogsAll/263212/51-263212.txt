  						    500+ Pt. 3  So what?  Maybe I'm getting a little carried away.  I've only had a two parter once, never a trilogy.  Below is some music from my cd collection that I've been listening to and enjoying.  Under that I have created a list of cd's I'm looking to purchase soon.  Smalltown Poets- Third Verse , in its entirety. Elvis Costello and The Attractions- All This Useless Beauty , I love The Other End(of the telescope). Jars of Clay-  The Eleventh Hour , When this first came out I gave it a bad review.  I was going through rough times and the album was simply too slow and somber for me.  I wanted music to scream to.  I'm giving it another chance now.  It's worth it. The Waiting- Wonderfully Made , Good stuff, I like it even better after seeing them live last week. All of Counting Crows albums. Weezer- Maladroit   Soon to be acquired: The Who- Who's Next  Pete Yorn- musicforthemorningafter  Whiskeytown- Pneumonia  The Elms- Big Surprise   After Gracefest last week I ponder getting some Cadet and Tait.  In a world of processed music it's difficult to know the sincerity of people sometimes.  I wasn't sure of these, but the show helped matters.  Tait puts on a good show.  He's definetly more real than I gave him credit for.
