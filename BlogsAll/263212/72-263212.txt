  						    The Eve of Destruction  "Eat, Drink and Be Merry for tomorrow you shall have class."  Mere days ago I told you I was indifferent about school starting up again.  Tonight I tell you I'm dreading it.  14 and a half hours of freedom remain.  School wasn't out for summer, not for me.  It seems as though it will be in session, forever.    I want to do better this time but worry that I won't.  I have no motivation.  I feel as though I'm walking right into calamity.  It's not stress.  It's not anxiousness.  It's simply the whiny 8th grader inside of me pleaing, "I don't want to go."  But go I must.  I've been trying to hype myself up.  It's not working.  I wish I could feel like a college freshmen one more time, ready to take on the world.  Instead I'm a senior, burnt out and feeling trapped.  Trapped?  Oh, I'd take a semester off with no dice about it, but I can't afford to pay my loans off.  Those darn loans.  It's a trick.    My room is a wreck.  I'm not going to get all my stuff laid out.  Maybe I'll find something to wear tomorrow that isn't too wrinkled.  Maybe I'll get it all together.  Maybe I won't.  Perhaps I'll draw up the energy needed to clear my bed of these twelve new books.  Maybe I'll just sleep on top of them.
