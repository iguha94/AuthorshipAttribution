  						    A Jerk's Sincerest Apology  sometimes you'd like to stand up and knock my teeth out but you're not mean enough even though I could use it so much  I'm sorry I made you so mad that you made those death threats I'm sorry that I called the police and sent you to jail without bail all those weeks  I should have understood it was for my own good it wasn't a threat but a promise instead I should have understood I drove you to do all those things that were unlike you  you said you wanted to hit me and I know there's no mean bone in your body that let's me know I'm pretty guilty you said you wanted to hurt me and let me break because you'd had all you could take and the hurt in your face was my fault  you took it all too well you took it all too well and I'm still taking it like a little boy it should be easier it should be simpler to be filled with joy black eyes fade out in days time maybe bad times fade out as fast  your words were harsh but not spoken out of turn your words were harsh but never undeserved  as for me and my statements I don't mean I send to you my apologies how on earth could you believe love from me if I make you doubt every other thing?
