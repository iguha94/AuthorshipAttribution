  						    Sporadic Thought Guy  I was journalling all of this, then I wrote, "I feel like 'Sporadic Thought Guy'(cue theme music)".    I get these large plates of food to a)bulk up and b) get my money's worth but I end up having to rake most of it into the garbage because I can't eat anymore.   I like to punch walls, and other hard surfaces.  I enjoy people's reaction or imagining what their reaction might be.  I enjoy the minimal pain that it brings, even when later my fists are sore.  I was telling Chaz this and he said I didn't want to break my hand, especially if I ever wanted to play piano, which I do.  When telling Donna about this conversation I had the idea for a movie about a pianist/boxer.  At some point he'd have to decide between the two.  Someone almost told me something, but then didn't.  I can't help but wonder what it might be.  I almost think I know, but there's no way I'd guess.  You know what makes me feel good?  Nothing.  No seriously, when Jeremy and I are in here and he asks what I'm listening to, then says its good, that makes me feel good.  It feels like a complement to my taste in music, especially since its happened a few times.    Today, August 27th is a day that will live in infamy...until tomorrow.
