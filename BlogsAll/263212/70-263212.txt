  						    Music and Motivation  I sit here with 10 minutes til class.  I'll leave in about 8.  I'm already behind.  I'm going to get ahead of things this weekend.  As for now I'm headed to class without having read the assignment.  I am slightly more motivated than I was Sunday night.  I don't want my doing better to be simply a matter of self-discipline, but rather I want it to be God actually changing me.  Still, I have my part to play.  I just don't want to lie to myself or anyone else and say that I'm pumped about school.  I'm not.  I pray for motivation.  I don't want the same ol' same ol' again.    I'm listening to Craig's Brother, the album  Lost at Sea .  I like it.  I borrowed this, Further Seems Forever's  The Moon is Down  and  Cake and Pie , Lisa Loeb's latest, all from   Rich.   I know several songs off the first two.  I am going to buy them sometime.  I ordered four new cd's yesterday.  BMG was having a 'buy one get three for free' sale.   The Who-  Who's Next  The Elms-  Big Surprise  Bob Dylan-  Oh Mercy  Pete Yorn-  Musicforthemorningafter   I'll be back around later with more.  See ya then.
