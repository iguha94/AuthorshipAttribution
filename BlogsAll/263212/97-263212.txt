  						    Escaping Escapism  As much of an escapist as I have been I don't take pride in that.  As much as I flinch when hearing tales of the detestable wicked that is everyday elsewhere in the world I cannot turn away.   I'm tired of lying to myself and of being lied to.  I'm tired of being an insensitive American satisfied with my luxury and comfortable in my living room watching re-runs.   I've lived in the land of make-believe for far too long.  I can't turn the channel anymore.  This 'real world' is one of impending threats and persecution.  This 'real world' is one of violence.  I can't pretend the world is peaceful.  What I can do is let the peace I have in Christ permeate me so much so that it is seen by everyone I come in contact with.  My desire is that they will recognize that peace is only in Him.    The reality is that September 11th is not an isolated event,wherein during one day horror was inflicted on the world and peace was restored the next.  The reality is that these type things have happened before and will happen again.    Some say  that these bombings in Bali are on the same scale as 9/11.  Should we care any less that we are not being attacked?  I think not.  The greater reality is Christ.  He's the only prayer we've got.  He's the only hope this world has of redemption.  Are we going to pretend that's not true also?  Let us forsake apathy and embrace empathy.  Further Reading:   Amongst Other Things -D W is very profound on the subject.
