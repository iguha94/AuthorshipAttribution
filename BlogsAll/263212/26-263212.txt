  						    No Kinder Savior   I've had   Smalltown Poets'  album, Third Verse, for a few weeks but only recently started listening to it.  I am amazed.  Throughout the days parts of each song play simultaneously in my mind.  This is more of that music, like The Waiting, that opens my heart to God.  One song stood out of the myst of great songs, and became the instant favorite.  Below are the lyrics.  Please read them.  I'm interested how this song, and others speak to you.    No Kinder Savior   It's best to meet these things head on, she said  Before too much gets on your mind   Thoughts like books are piling up   Sometimes the lessons don't seem kind   The fighting feelings will get easier   The ones that make your mood stay blue   You have believed the lie for long enough   No kinder Savior comes for you   Chorus:    Hallelujah, Hallelujah   Sing the blessings, sing them down   For the one who's ready to give up   No kinder Savior will be found   I've even tried to hear from God, he said   Didn't Jesus love the weak?   She said, he was willing to give up   That is, the man who couldn't speak   The story goes that when his tongue was loosed   Expecting cries of pent up grief   The crowd astonished by the spectacle   All heard a song of new belief   Sing a song about a higher love   That we would know it at first sight   Sing it loud and long enough   He could make it real tonight   Chorus   There are few who want this narrow door   Most seekers seek a broader pass   Hoping somehow they are living up   To what any god would ask   And longing for a kinder Savior   From the tyranny of days   There already is a Savior   Yeah, He already lead the way
