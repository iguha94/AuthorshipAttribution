  						    Church Boy  I had to remind Chaz yesterday why I don't go to church around here.   We go to talking and I realized I haven't really been going to church.  It's been some time since I faithfully attended a church.  What I told him was that I don't go around here because I don't feel comfortable, or like I'm part of things.  Hey, church if a lifelong church attendee and Christian feels this way, how then do you suppose a non-believer feels?  Most likely,  not welcome.  I know the necessity for me to be actively participating and fellowshipping in a local body of believers.  Up until I left for college three years ago I always did this.  Since then I have been in and out of different churches, a few months here, a few there, a few weeks here and so on.  Over the past two semesters it's gotten to be of greater regularity that I just don't go.  I use the excuse that I don't have transportation, and it isn't always as easy as people make out to get a ride.  Usually Chaz walks.  He asked if I wanted to go with him.  I was like, "Well, I could say I went."  I couldn't turn this down, not after our conversation.  So I went to church last night.  I feel like maybe I'll start going to Damascus again.  Either way, I'm going somewhere and I'm going to go there faithfully. I'm too weak without it.
