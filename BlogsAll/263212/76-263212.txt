  						    Not Another April  Contrary to popular belief,hope and/or fear I'm not dead.  Sorry to disappoint.  I come to you bearing the smile of a guy who now has the internet in his room.  Maybe you are thinking, "well, ladee freakin' da", but this is a monumental ocassion for me.  Of course, its all thanks to my new roommate,   Jeremy Cook .  He's the one with the computer.  I've lived alone since November.  It looks like we're going to get along pretty good.    The past couple days I've found myself hamging out with   Rich  a lot.  It's good to have him back on campus.  Me and him went with a new guy,Jacob,to eat and hang out with Lori.  Naturally, Rich and I talk about blogs a lot.  Jacob asked, "Is it required to have a blog?  It seems everyone here has one.  I haven't been to orientation yet."  We two bloggers burst into compulsions of laughter.  I don't think he understood why.    I got 4/7 items on my to do list completed.  Now all that's left is that darned incomplete work for a class I took this summer, financial aide forrays, and signing up for the meal plan.  Come to think of it there are a couple other things I need to tend to, one of which is a job.  My hope is to find a library or bookstore to hire me.    Tonight I'm going to give  The Fellowship of The Ring   a second chance.  I forget what I was going to say.  Don't you hate that?
