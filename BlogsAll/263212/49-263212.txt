  						    Mysterious Ways  God has spoken to me in mysterious ways a couple times this week.  The first instance was two days ago I was praying out on the back porch.  Most of the time I question my sincerity.  It feels right, but I'm rarely sure I can trust myself.  I poured my heart out having been upset with myself for staying away a few days.  I finished.  Not five seconds later my dad stepped outside.  He didn't know where I was.  Somehow I knew this was God's way of affirming my sincerity and saying that He was there with me. Call me crazy.  Then Monday night He 'spoke' again.  I had winamp on shuffle as usual.  5 songs with a specific and unique connection played.  Each of them addressed something that had been on my mind earlier this summer.  The first song appealed to my sentimental nature and took me back.  It was this one that brought the subject up.  I hadn't been thinking about it at all,recently.  The second posed a question.  The third reminded me what my attitude needs to be.  The fourth was almost verbatim my feelings on the subject.  I wondered if this was God okaying my position.  The fifth and final at first seemed unrelated, but then I realized it's like my attempted state of mind lately, sheer bliss.  Odd as it might be, the song was called Opium.    Call it a stretch, but I don't believe in random acts of anything.  It happened for a reason.  What does God want me to take from that?
