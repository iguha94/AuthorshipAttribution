  						    Blame Jeff  Sunday night      Jeff  made me aware that   Dashboard Confessional  had an Unplugged on MTV2.  I could have watched it had I known sooner.  He didn't think to say anything about it before because no one in this  great,great,great  town of Graceville has MTV or VH1, much less MTV2. I want my VH1!  I wanted to call G'ville God forsaken, but that really isn't true.    Anyhow, the show was replaying the next morning at 10.  He begged and begged until I finally agreed to record it for him, for both os us.  I woke up at 9:30 Monday.  Still half-awake, I flipped the television over to the station.  The show was already on.  It seems Jeff was a victim of time zone confusion.    I thought I'd try to tape the remaining half.  After finding a tape to use, I couldn't get things set right.  I gave in to the powers that be and just watched the show.    What I saw, I liked.  With the intimacy of the crowd it was just like when we all went to see them live last December (subtract the Zen-Buddhist guy who did some kinda weird windmill dance in front of everybody).    My mom questioned me watching MTV.  "Everything I've ever seen on it was bad."  I don't endorse everything that airs on the network, not most of it actually.  Still, it isn't all bad.  I've never known her to be against it.  This was a new one on me.  I didn't know what to say.  That was an awkward moment, but things went along fine.  I told her this was the band I had gone to see in Tallahassee.  I said, "I knew about them before MTV did."  That was a very Jeff thing of me to say.  What I meant by it was that I liked them awhile before they  made it  on to the channel.  Of course, Jeff is to blame for that.
