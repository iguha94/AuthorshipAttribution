  						    The Truth Doesn't Hurt  The truth only hurts because there are lies. We are born into this lie.  We live(die) in this lie.  This lie is that we are self-sufficient.  This lie is that it doesn't get any better.  This lie is that we ought to just accept things like they are and get used to it.  This lie is that this way is more desirable than His Way. We are born into this lie.  Sanctification for the Christian is the process by which God removes us from that bubble and places us in the light of His truth.  This is never painless because even knowing the truth we are still melded to this world (literally: attached) and we cling to it.  Sanctification is the process of God,little by little,snipping us from this stillborn womb.  Through sanctification we meld to His truth and cling to Him more and more.  The truth is God is the great physician.  He delivers the stillborn into new life.  The truth doesn't really hurt.  The lies hurt and they hurt real bad.  The truth delivers us from pain, but this deliverance is an ongoing event.  This life on earth is that womb.  Little by little we get closer to The Truth.  Little by little the pain in our hearts is replaced with love,hope,joy,faith and freedom.  Don't believe the lies, the truth doesn't hurt.
