  						    A Number 2 with Coke  Sometimes there's no better treat in the world than a Double Cheeseburger combo.    Jeff  and I stepped out for an hour and drove to Chipley.  He rented a couple movies.  I almost did, but $3.79 is too much.  Besides, I'll just wait til I go home and let mom pay for it.  Yes, I still think like a high schooler, call it business savvy.  I don't know many high school kids with money woes.   After that we drove over to McDonald's.  Me, being the cheapskate that I am pondered getting a cheeseburger and water.  Of course, those combos are reasonably priced, so I got me one.  I sound like a commercial.  Maybe, I am.  I began eating this feast and commented to Jeff, "This might be blasphemy but I like this a lot more than Wendy's."  Then I said, "There's something about eating in a car that I like".  This something makes the food taste that much better, and the meal that much more memorable.  Jeff was being reminiscent on the past year.  It was little more than a year ago that our friendship started.  We've both grown a lot in these past 400 days or so.  I felt like I had myself together then.  Now I feel like i'm coming apart.  The irony of this is that I look at who I was and the way I saw life, and I don't think I could have been very much more foolish than I was.  I didn't have anything together.  To finish off the meal Jeff and I bought those little apple pie's, 2 for a dollar.  Yeah, that made it.  And you know, I wouldn't have thought to buy them myself.  I'm too cheap for that. This was his suggestion.  In the same way, I see that he has added a lot to my life that I wouldn't have asked for, but have appreciated.  Thanks for the ride, Jeff.  Oh, and when I say ride I mean the experience it's been knowing you.  It's been a crazy trip, but we've come a long way.  What's this 'WE' business?
