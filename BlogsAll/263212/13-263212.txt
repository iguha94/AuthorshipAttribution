  						    Reading Me   Five months ago one of my top three professors, Dr. Freeman let me borrow a book called,  The Grace of God, The Will of Man .  It's fifteen articles about twenty pages in length on topics concerning God's sovreignty and human responsibility.  I want to retain enough of what I learn to be able to hold an intelligent conversation with this teacher of mine.  This is some of why I have yet to go through with this.  It is an intimidating task.  I feel bad I've had the book for so long.  I want to get it back to him this week.  Today I took my sub and coke ,sat outside and read about ten pages.    A couple carloads of 'the kids' are going to a 'hardcore show' tonight.  Scott has persistently encouraged me to go to this and a few other shows lately.  I deeply appreciate this.  Why am I not inspired to?  I think the show is going to be great.  I just haven't been so enthralled by the idea.  I used to go to shows all the time.  I love the atmosphere.  I love the flow of thought I experience.  I love being able to say I was there.  It's like I'm weighing my options.  As much as I do not like the thought of being stranded in my room all night, I prefer it to going.    I hear Jeff singing in the hall.  I hope I sound that good.    Soon I hope to write and post articles on theology, philosophy, music, film and apologetics.
