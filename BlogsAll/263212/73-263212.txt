  						    "It's not a doll, it's an action figure."  For a few years in the early-mid eighties I was all about He-Man.  That's probably one of the few times in my life I was into the popular thing.  It's excusable, we're talking about He-Man.     One year my birthday party had a  Masters of the Universe  theme.  My dad even made me a cake to go along with it.  That was supremely cool.   I had all the action figures. I think I had the lunch box too.    Yesterday a bunch of us were in Dothan when we heard Toys 'R' Us was selling 5 of the figures in a set for 200 bucks.  We were there in five seconds.  We were back to being easily pleased 5 year olds.  Those were the days when I'd smash Hot Wheels up with a hammer.  Was I the only one?   Ahh, memory lane.  They talked about how their parents sold or destroyed their action figures.  I wondered what had happened to mine.  Mom, what did you do to them?    We reminisced on the toys, the cartoon and the movie.  The new purple cat, whatever its called, has that gross fake fur, it was much cooler in plastic.  I don't think most fans appreciated the movie, but I did.  About 45 minutes ago half the guys in the dorm and others assimilated in the dayroom for the re-airing of old episodes.  It's very rare aside from a dorm meeting that large groups of guys hang out like that.  It's starting now at 6 pm central time.  On August 30th a new series starts.  These guys are hooting and hollering.  It's just one big happy riot.  Yeah...
