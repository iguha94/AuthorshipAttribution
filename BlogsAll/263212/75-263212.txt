  						    Office Space  Last night me and a couple of the guys watched  Office Space .   I liked it the first and second time around, but this third one put the movie on my list of favorite comedies.  I relate to the central character, Peter Gibbons, much like I relate to Cusack's Lloyd Dobler and Rob Gordon.  The part is played by Ron Livingston, and my guess is, I'm related.  Either way, I know I can relate to this movie very well.  I think most people can.  I will admit that the movie is a bit more vulgar than I can endorse, but I must add that the creators didn't rely on that to carry the movie.  Numerous aspects of it reminded me of  High Fidelity .  I love the way itmocks so much about the corporate world so well, so accurately.  I expect to be writing more on this.    The dialogue below encapsulates the role of Peter Gibbons.  To be quite honest, It's how I've been feeling the past few months.    Peter: I don't like my job and I don't think I'll go anymore.  Joanna: You're just not gonna go?  Peter: Yeah.  Joanna: Won't you get fired?  Peter: I don't know. But I really don't like it and, uh, I'm not gonna go.  Joanna: So you're gonna quit?  Peter: Uh-uh. Not really. I'm just gonna stop going.  Joanna: When did you decide all that?  Peter: About an hour ago.  Joanna: So you're going to get another job?  Peter: I don't think I'll like another job.  Joanna: Well what are you going to do about money? Bills?  Peter: You know I never really liked paying bills, I don't think I'm going to do that either.
