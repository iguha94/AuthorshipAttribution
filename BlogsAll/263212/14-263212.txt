  						    Drainage Ditch   I finally got the paper out of the way.  I cancelled our prayer group again so I could get it turned in earlier.  After my last class I sat out in the courtyard for awhile.  The sun was so nice.  Shadows were everywhere.  It was warm for a change.  I wrote a few poems about this.  i was trying to write these truly wacked out poems.  I'm listening to my favorite Weezer song,  Butterfly  covered by the Ataris. "I told you I would return when the robin makes its nest, but I ain't ever coming back." I need to get a new notebook immediately.  This afternoon an unnamed friend of mine swam across the lake we have on campus.  This was the big event in Graceville today.  Would you swim across a very dirty lake?  What's your price?  I said I would do it that simple if everyone would call me "Cast Away".  I'm refraining from naming him more to be funny than anything. He might get in trouble.  If the school's administration wants to be honest and call it what it is, a drainage ditch, then maybe they have a case.  Other than that lakes are meant to be swam in.  It's Friday night for crying out, I can't stay cooped up in here.  I got to get gone.
