  						    Letters To Myself   Earlier tonight Mike was telling me about a letter he wrote himself when he was eight.  He said it was kind of neat.  I thought, "I should do that."  Then I realized that's what my journals are.  Actually, I was reading over entries I've made since January.  This was haunting.  Boy, this has been a long semester.  Some days seem like they were just yesterday.  Some feel like years ago.  Still, it's all so beautifully interwoven that even the farthest memories seem as close as an embrace.  I see the resolutions I've made and broken.  Mike said I was just being hard on myself, but it's hard to see where I've changed for the better.  Yet, I can list off so many ways in which I have changed.  The Lord is still working on me.  I feel like I am a puzzle.  God can already see the completed picture, He's holding the box lid.  Right now, He's still sorting out all the edge pieces.  It's only a puzzle when the pieces are scattered.  He who puts the puzzle together is not puzzled in the least.  What will people see in me?  Will the Light reflect so bright that it heals blind eyes?  I prayed today that God would give me a passion which leads to compassion.  Everyone is passionate, too many don't act on that (compassion).  I pray that God would guide me to sincerity in prayer and depth in Bible study.  I want Him to speak to me.  I'm crying out for that.  I'm tired of these endless cycles and all of what feels like praying in vain.  I'm crying out.    Chaz, Donna, Fozzy, and Jed all left for West Virginia at 5:00 am this morning.  They and others from the school will be doing missions work.  I'm excited for them.  They'll return with so many stories.  I can't wait.  I must admit this town is emptier without them.  I spend a lot of everyday with these four people.  I don't know what to make of their absence.
