  						    Captain Reformation   Yesterday my mind got cluttered with various brands of pain and aggravation.  I needed a walk to take and a friend to talk to so, Chaz and I set out at 11.  We ventured down the alleys and avenues of Graceville.  We talked on the topics of God, faith, the reformation, destiny, art, and all else that was wedged into my brain.  Chaz is always good to talk to when we go on these excursions.  Last night was no different.  Walking, talking and breathing in the night air really worked wonders.  At the onset of our journey he began a rant about how he is tired of all the drama, the breaking hearts,the hard feelings, the misunderstandings, and the suspense.  He proclaimed, "Everybody just needs to get together, and hug, and ... mosh! "  That wasn't quite what I was expecting him to say.  It struck me funny.  I laughed and said to him that I was going to quote him on the site.  Then he starting getting all worked up and louder.  I said to him, "Now you're just reaching for it."  He admitted this truth, "Yeah".  You know, I really am thankful for this friendship.  We have our differences.  He is reformed, and I am not.  Still, we manage to get along and relate to one another so well that the friendship is a source of encouragement and enjoyment.  I don't always agree with him, but I don't have to.  That's not what friends are for.
