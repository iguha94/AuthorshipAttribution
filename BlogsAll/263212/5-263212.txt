  						    Reap and Sow   This is me taking one more break too many.  Tomorrow I board a bus at 1:20.  I have to hand in a paper for the class I'm going with as I load up.  All I have now are notes from two books.  I'm looking at this sheet with 3 questions I'm supposed to answer and I only understand one.  The other two confuse me.  I don't think I have the resources here to fulfill them.  This is the fruit of the procrastination I sow.  Something tells me that Dr. Cunningham will give me a couple days once were back Tuesday.  Maybe, but he strongly wanted us to have this done.  This trip concludes the class.  We won't meet anymore.  He doesn't want this paper to be hanging over our heads after.  The trip and the paper are required for the class.  If I can't finish this (and it ain't looking too hot) and he won't take it late, this trip was a waste of my time.  I could lie and say,"Oh man, I forgot to bring it", but I'm not.  I'm not motivated to write.  This confusion is not helping.   BRAIN EMPTY .  Smashing my head on the desk isn't helping either.  I hope he'll take it late.  I pray.    I don't think I'll have internet access, so I've made arrangements to get my posts out.    Jed the Fed  is going to do me the tremendous favor of posting my blogs as I call them in to him.  It'll be like on CNN with the live tape feed and a picture of the guy.  Well, sorta.  Thanks Jed.  Hey, and thank him for me.  Give the boy a hit or two.
