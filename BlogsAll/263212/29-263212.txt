  						    Ghosts of a Dying Season   I burned myself a cd this weekend and this was the title.  It's 22 songs that capture the essence of the last semester.  It's 22 songs that relate both directly and indirectly.  Some because they fit line by line the stories and situations that unfolded this Spring.  Others because I heard them a lot during the months and on many nights of drama and dreams.  I can sing these with all my heart.  I can reflect on this lake of days, but summer is a pool of its own.  I'll drown if I don't keep swimming.  It should always be one's hope to not be the same.  I will still be me, and these friends of mine will continue to be themselves.  Yet temporal elements will change.  It looks scary, but so do rollercoasters.  I'm looking forward to all of it.  When I do look back its in joy, and not regret.  I cherish memories.  I cherish making them all the more.  I do not agree that the 'good ol' days' are gone.  There is quite a bit from the past few days I want to tell you, especially saying goodbye to Donna.  I will write that later on, but now I need to pick up a book for my class that starts tomorrow.  I've never made above a C in a class with this teacher and I am intent to do so this time.
