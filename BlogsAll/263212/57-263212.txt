  						    Tuesday with Mitch  I was writing a review of  Novocaine  when I got to get online yesterday.  I thought it would be my blog for the day, but didn't finish it.  If I had thought about it, and I usually do, I would have posted something else.  Thus ends my 14 day streak.  I have this hope of setting a record for the most consecutive days one person has ever updated a weblog.  Call me crazy.  If  Forrest Gump  can trek across country back and forth like that, I can do this.  Well, he was fictional, but people have done more.  I'm here at   Justin's place .  I downloaded an hour's worth of Mitch Hedberg.  He's a comedian I've liked since I heard him on Letterman a couple years back.    I'll write more later, if you're lucky, but for now I'll leave you with a word from Mitch. "My friend said to me, 'I hear music.' As though there is any other way you can take it in.  I was like, 'You are not special, that is how I receive it too.' "   UPDATE:    10/27/'02 Previously, I had mispelled Mitch's last name.  I realized this and fixed it.  Still, I've noticed scores of you finding this site by searching for the incorrect spelling.  In case you don't know, it's spelled with two e's, Hedberg.  There's no u in Hedberg.  Thank you.
