  						    Memento Mori  From the  Memento  dvd I saw an interview with Christopher Nolan.  He explained where the idea originated.  His brother was writing a short story with the basic idea and he told him about it.  Chris asked him if he could start writing a screenplay based on the idea.  The two stories are distinctly different, but if you enjoyed the movie you should also read  Memento Mori .  It was also included on the dvd.  I also felt compelled to transcribe some of it off the screen and into my notebook.  "We're all at the mercy of a limbic system, clouds of electricity drifting through the brain. Every man is broken into twenty-four hour fractions, and then again within those twenty-four hours.  It's a daily pantomime, one man yielding control to the next: a backstage crowded with old hacks clamoring for their turn in the spotlight.  Every week, every day....The angry man hands the baton over to the sulking man, and in turn to the sex addict, the introvert, the conversationalist.  Every man is a mob, a chain gang of idiots...This is the tragedy of life because for a few minutes of every day every man becomes a genius.  That's the miserable truth.  For a few moments the secrets of the universe are opened to us.  Life is a cheap parlor trick...But then, the genius, the savant has to hand over the controls to the next guy down the pike, most likely the guy who just wants to eat potato chips, and insight and brilliance and salvation are all entrusted to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic."
