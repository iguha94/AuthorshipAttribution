  						    Getting Intimate   At 9 this morning I was in the dentist' chair.  Nothing new but I have a distal on number fifteen, or something, whatever that means.  I was having a few new ideas.  One, I bet dentists abhor patients with facial hair.  Two, a cleaning is an intimate/personal act.  I mean,  the dental hygenist' hands are all over the patient's face.  The patient is somewhat vulnerable, sitting there at the hygenist' control with a mouth wide open.  The hygenist could drug patients up and throw them in a hidden room, easy.  It's a dangerous task going to the dentist.  I'm just glad I got out alive.  Seriously, it is somewhat intimate, as far as being close or vulnerable to someone.  No one can help but to breathe on the person as they do his or her job.  I gagged four times today.  Twice when she was trying to photograph my teeth.  My wisdom teeth are coming in.  I'm scared of what that will soon mean.  Another thing that surely adds to the initimacy of the occassion is the strange communication.  Patients are forced to answer questions, sometimes difficult, with muffled voices and grunts.  Somehow the hygenist's are able to translate.  Might that be the spiritual gift of interpreting tongues?  All of this combined gives a false sense that the patient has known the hygenist for years and years.  The hygenist now feels like a close friend, at least until the patient leaves.  Don't take me the wrong way.  I'm not falling for anyone here.  I'm simply describing the situation and how it can be quite awkward.
