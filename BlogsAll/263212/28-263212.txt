  						    The Clock on the Wall   This afternoon I walked with Jed to drop some mail off.  I was telling him how this summer feels like a hyphen.  It's like spring and fall are one word.  I can't know what the word is until the second half is written.  In the same breath I told him all that I expect from Summer.  My expectations make it at least a paragraph.  I believe the events of this season will have large impact on what the second half of the word is.  I gave him a third analogy.  This summer is like a movie that I really want to see, but don't feel like watching now.  I am all too aware that it is a movie.  So aware that I can't get into the movie.  As the scenes play before me I become part of it.  The distinguishing lines of the screen fade.  I no longer notice the unending ticking of a clock on the wall.  I am one of the characters.  I carry on conversation with them.  My heartbreaks at their twisting fate.  Before I realize it, the credits are rolling.  Only then do I remember that I've been watching a movie.  I comment on how it was such an amazing film and how it has changed me.  The movie is now a part of me that I was not aware of before, but would no longer know myself without.  In the fall I will ramble on about the things that summer showed me.  I'll share these lessons with anyone who will listen, and some who won't.  I'll consider myself naive for dreading the summer, in the least.  I'm all too aware of the screen.  I pray the lines will fade faster.  I count down each day, but I want to lose track.
