  						    The Wallflowers  The Band's got a new one due out November 5th called  Red Letter Day .  I'm looking forward to that as I've enjoyed the previous major label releases.  As artistically diverse as  Breach  was I'm still sticking to  Bringing Down the Horse  as my favorite from the band.  Who knows what the newest will bring.  My favorite of theirs is "Three Marlenas" which I've deemed a driving song, based not on a few of the lines which make it so but instead the haunting b3 organ that pushes through it.  I've got just one question,What's a marlena?  Is it a rule?    Perhaps, If he continues to make music for another 30 years Jakob Dylan will be as well respected as his father.  "Three Marlenas"  Alone tonight in somebody's bed  She gone and dyed her hair red  She only went and did what she did  'Cause he would drive her home then  There's lipstick on her new dress  She hadn't even paid yet  But it doesn't matter where the money went  It wasn't how she paid her rent    One, two, three Marlenas  There's got to be someone we can trust  Out here among us    Now lookin' out across the city lights  She thought they'd be a good pair  Now he could make a living sellin' cars  Maybe she could work there  She's gonna pick a star in the night  And pray to make it all right  She tried so hard not to pick a kite  She always prayed to heaven lights    One, two, three Marlenas There's got to be someone we can trust Out here among us  One, two, three Marlenas  It's see no, speak no, hear no evil about us  The three Marlenas   Man, I think I'm gonna buy myself a Rolls  Maybe a Chevrolet  One where I can pull that top down  Just let my radio play  Now I'm headin' out on that highway  I'm goin' right out of state  Now I ain't lookin' back until I'm gone  Right through heaven's gates    One, two, three Marlenas There's got to be someone we can trust  Out here among us  One, two, three Marlenas  Ya see no, speak no, hear no evil among us  The three Marlenas  Three Marlenas Three Marlenas
