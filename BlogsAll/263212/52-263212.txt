  						    500+  I've had two music folders on here for the longest time.  One is pre-Kazaa downloads.  The other is everything I've gotten from Kazaa.  Yesterday I combined the two.  In total there are over 500 songs.  Yeah, that's cool.  Now all I need is a burner and I will be set.    Here's my deal with burning.  The majority of what I have here is rare stuff that I can't find to buy anywhere.  It's bootleg stuff,b-sides,stuff only released in the UK,things no longer in print,and material from scratched projects.    Still, I have loads of stuff I could have bought and some that I have bought.  What would I do with a burner?  I've never been a big advocate of burning entire albums.  I've done it, mind you, but its always with the premise that I'll buy it at some point.  What I have burned are mix cd's.  I would love to master this fine art.  DJ Rob Gordon inspired that.  I justify burning some things, I think everyone does.  For example I'll burn a Beatles album without any qualms.  I reason that they've made enough money.  Besides two of them are dead.  Ultimately this justification falls flat.  I think the artist deserves creative control of their music.  Of course, sometimes they give it away to the record company.  If the artist is filthy stinking rich I think he still has the right to charge ridiculous amounts for his product.  He's made something with his blood,sweat and tears.  He can be 'greedy' about it and we can't stop him.  The onle way we have of stopping him is buy refusing to pay.  Most people aren't willing to do that.    The people who act like bands and artists should just let us have their music remind me of when I was growing up and kids would be jealous over what siblings had.  They would fuss about it, til the parent either took from the one and gave to the other, or bought the same thing for them.    My next post will be what this post was going to be.  I'm going to list for you just what my music folder contains.
