  						    Drying Eyes   In a positive, yet weird, moment, Jeff chased me from the cafeteria.  A bunch of us were having a grand ol' time.  I thought I'd step into this room for a second.  The plan is to go to Waffle House or something typical.  I hope they don't leave me.  It's going to be great.  When I wrote the last post it could have been said that I was 'unhappy' as Dane put it.  Today I made a point to be joyful.  It wasn't fake.  I just had to dig for it.  I may feel like dying at points during the day, but I can't forget He wants me to live more fully through Him.  My world may feel upside down but God is still God.  Whether we be just friends or what I am doing all that is in my power to maintain the friendship that Donna and I have.  It is most obviously a gift from God.  I will not let Satan or stupidity or selfishness tear that apart.  Things aren't quite as awkward.  Things almost feel like normal.  I am not sad, and I have no right to be.  My soul has been spared from eternal damnation by Christ's great and perfect act of love and grace upon the cross.  How can I let today weigh me down.  I will perservere.    As for the comment frenzy:  Anonymous you are forgiven.  Thank you for coming and talking to us.  Dane and Esteban thanks for the words of wisdom and for taking the time to write all that in.  For those who defended me, thanks.  Let us all be forgiving, for we have been forgiven.    As for ???...the identity is still unknown.  I only say this to clarify that it is not Anonymous.  I'm not worried.
