  						    All That and A Ball of Wax  Yesterday was a pretty good day.  I went to sleep the night before with every intention of attending church.  I woke in the worst pain I've ever felt.  An earache.  So I didn't go to church.  I went to the doctor.    Jed  drove me and my mom met us up there, because the insurance card I have is out of date.  I couldn't tell Jed how to get there.  After stopping and asking for directions, we made it there.  Then we got to wait!  That was a lot of fun.  While waiting Jed and I joked about how the whole event was just this big stunt, like something from the life of Truman Burbank.  I wrote a poem called,  Ode to Helen Keller, Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Richards .  I made it to the back where I got to wait even more.  Yippee!  Finally they irrigated my ear.  From this came two almost marble-sized rocks of wax.  I thought they'd be orange, but no they were black.  Immediately, my ear started to feel a little better.  I could hear better than i've been able to in a couple months.  Some last semester I kept worrying that I might be going deaf, but the problem was this simple.  He also said I had an ear infection.  He scribbled me a prescription and sent me along.  As soon as I took the pain mediicine I was happy.  Without mom and Jed I might have died alone.  Well, no, not really.  I would still be suffering without them.
