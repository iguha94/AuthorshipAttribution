  						    Post-Modern Conductors  Music reviewers are some of the most under appreciated and unrecognized writers.  They have a vast knowledge of a subject.  Most of us barely know what we like, much less how to explain it.  I understand people that don't care what genre a band's music fits into.  Personally, I think we tend to take the categorization too far.  However, I want to be able to talk educated about what I like.  So I read music reviews, a favorite pasttime.  Before I've said that commentaries and other supplements on DVD's are like film school for me.  I get a lot of useful head knowledge when a director, et cetera, explain a scene or shot.  In the same way music reviews are as useful.  I can understand better what it is I like.  I can communicate that to others.  These reviews serve as a guide to experimentation.  I can read who influenced a band, who a band is like, and who they've influenced.    ...and...  I've always wanted to have a band.  I'm forever thinking up band names and writing songs.  As of yet, I haven't mastered any instrument, but I'm going to start the piano soon.  Inspiration via Ben Folds, but I know I'll never be able to play like that.  Then I read these reviews and get discouraged.  The kind of music I want to make takes genius.  I don't want to just make something people can ignore, or for that something they wish they could.  I don't want to make 'crappy pap'.  I'm not mathematically minded.  These who I like most, these post-modern conductors have pure genius and God-given talent.  I don't think I have that, not for this.  I'd settle for being a part of their orchestra.  Let me sing.  Let me write.  Let me tell you my wacky ideas.  Tell me their no good.  That's fine, just let me be a part of that.
