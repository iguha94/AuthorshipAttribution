  						    Sheep and Crows  2:57 am.  I've done it again.  The problem is not being up late.  It's having to be up early.  These few days out of Graceville have been good.  I sound like a kid on the eve of the last day of summer.  I don't want to go back to school.  I feel like I'm more familiar with life here than I was with dorm life as of Thursday.  I don't want to go back to school, but Smith Hall is home to me.  Dorothy's words are slowly becoming a mantra for me.  I want to go home.  Still, I wonder if I should make it one more day.  I don't want to be cruel, I mean, I know everyone there misses me.  I downloaded 18 songs this weekend, mostly Counting Crows alternates, rarities and covers.  One of my favorites was a cover of George Jones'  A Good Year for the Roses .  I found this book blog,   Addicted to Books , via   Martin Roth .  Take my recommendation on this, especially if readings your thing.  Through him I found   Book Crossing , a very unique idea and non-blog.  Well kids, I'll count sheep if I have to, but I have to get to sleep.  See you when I wake up.
