  						    Noise Ordinance  Mr. Neighbor knocks on the wall and complains about the volume of my music.  I turn it down the first couple times because it was too loud.  Besides I try to respect people.  He complains offhand about the noise, but everyone else seems to think nothing of it.  Mr.  Neighbor makes a big deal of this.  Mr. Neighbor beats furiously on the wall.  The music was not too loud this time.  The pounding on the wall scared me, I didn't even know what it was for to start with.  I pounded back.  A few minutes after Mr. Neighbor comes in.  He threatens to tell Mr. Landlord.  I say the music isn't too loud.  He leaves to report me.  A while later Mr. Landlord comes in.  He okays the volume level.  A bit later Mr. Neighbor comes back in and says to turn the music down.  I tell him what our landlord said.  He gets mad and leaves to report me again.  I asked him to tell Mr. Landlord that I had it at the level he said I could.  Why does this feel like 9th grade?    I'm sincerely not trying to be mean about any of this.  I just don't get it or know how to handle it.  I don't appreciate conflict.
