  						    Good Morning  I took me a nap.  Now I'm ready to take on the world.  I had the privilege of talking to Lori by phone tonight.  I had every intention to blog about it when she left for Memphis a few weeks ago.  There was just so much that I wanted to say the ambition killed me.  Anyway, I really miss her.  I'm glad we have the telephone but these lines just won't cut it.  While we were talking she heard what she thought was either thunder or a jet.  I told her it was one of the creatures from  Signs  running on the roof above her.  Then I imitated that noise it made.  She asked me to stop because that stuff messes with her head.  So five minutes later out of respect  I discontinued the pestering, which I might add was quite enjoyable.  During our conversation   Jeremy  entered the room.  I offered him a doughnut.  I think this made his day.  With glee he took one Krispy Kreme doughnut from the box and left the room.  For some reason he brought it back a moment later.  He set it on a napkin, looked at me and said, "Don't let the ants get it!"  I pledged my devotion.  I don't think the dorm's ant infestation is that problematic.  Not sure though.  Within a minute he returned for it.  I had forgotten to watch over the doughnut.  Knowing this I leisurely told him, "I didn't let anything near it."  I am a man of no integrity.  One closing thought, I'm going to grow my sideburns back.  I haven't shaved in a few days so the beginnings are there.  It seems like a good idea.  That would make me feel at least somewhat better about this haircut.
