  						    Battle of Who Could Care Less  by Ben Folds  Do you not hear me anymore I know its not your thing to care I know its cool to be so bored But it sucks me in when you're aloof It sucks me in, it sucks it works I guess it's cool to be alone  Will you never rest Fighting the battle of who could care less Every day you wake up late Sometimes I wish I was that way  And you think Rockford Files is cool But there are some things that you would change If it were up to you So think about your masterpiece Watch the Rockford Files Call to see if Paul can score some weed  Will you never rest Fighting the battle of who could care less Unearned unhappiness That's okay, I guess ...  I've got this great idea Why don't we pitch it to the Franklin Mint: Fine pewter portraits of General Apathy and Major Boredom Singing whatever and ever amen ... ...Oh well, maybe not - I'll try again This should cheer you up for sure See, I've got your old I.D. And you're all dressed up like the Cure  Will you never rest Fighting the battle of who could care less Unearned unhappiness You're my hero I confess  *That says a lot.  Let me warn you, the album version of this includes the addition of one or two choice words.
