  						    Beardhat, Jed and Gary      I should be studying.  The Police, Every Little Thing She Does is Magic  is now playing on Winamp.  This song provided for many great scenes in the movies  Conspiracy Theory  and  10 Things I Hate About You .  I'll Never forget when Mel Gibson's character, Jerry Fletcher, said [to Julia Roberts' character],"I resolve to call you up a thousand times a day and ask you if you'll marry me some old sunny day."  What a stalker!!!  That was a great movie and it held a place in my top five for awhile.  Of course it isn't even in the top ten now.  I've recently revised my list and soon I'll post it.  I noticed   Justin  had linked to me.  When I get my links up he'll be there.  He'll always be there because that's just the kind of friend that BeardHat, as I liked to call him, is.  I expect to do good on my philosophy test tomorrow.  Tonight I asked   Jed  where Meta-Physics originated.  He answered,"It started with M".  That guy's a genius let me tell you.  A great friend Gary[no site],from Atlanta, called me twice tonight.  I wasn't here but I'll call back tomorrow.  Well, I best get to studying so I can talk to God about some things before sleep.
