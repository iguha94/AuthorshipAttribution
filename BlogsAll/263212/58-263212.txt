  						    Hard Candy    This is possibly my favorite off the new album, definetly top 3. It's such a good song, such well-written poetry.  I plan to give this Counting Crows' release of the same title a review sometime soon.    On certain Sundays in November  When the weather bothers me  I empty drawers of other summer's  Where my shadows used to be  She is standing by the water  As her smile begins to curl  In this or any other summer  She is something all together different  Never just an ordinary girl   And in the evenings on Long Island  When the colors start to fade  She wears a silly yellow hat  That someone gave her when she stayed  I didn't think that she returned it  We left New York in a whirl  Time expands and then contracts  When you are spinning  In the grips of someone  Who is not an ordinary girl   When you sleep  You find your mother in the night  But she stays just out of sight  So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming  And when you wake the morning covers you with light  And it makes you feel alright  But it's just the same hard candy  You're remembering again   You send your lover off to China  Then you wait for her to call  You put your girl up on a pedestal  Then you wait for her to fall  I put my summer's back in a letter  And I hide it from the world  All the regrets you can't forget  Are somehow pressed upon a picture  In the face of such an ordinary girl   When you sleep  You find your mother in the night  But she fades just out of sight  So there isn't any sweetness in the dreaming  And when you wake the morning showers you with light  And it makes you feel alright  But it's just the same hard candy  You're remembering again   And it's just the same hard candy  You're remembering again   Go ask her to come around  And see me late after dark  Don't ask me to come around  Then wait to see if there's a spark
