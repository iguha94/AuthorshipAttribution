  						    Weatherman Blues  It's 2:55, the last friend on the ole' instant messenger just signed off.  It gets late so early.  It seems like just yesterday I was waking up.  I've been making habit of these late nights.  I should grow up.  I should get a hair cut and part it just like a weatherman.  I should start tucking my shirts in.    Here and now I should stop regurgitating what everyone has told me.  My shirts will remain untucked.  I may not even comb my hair.  This isn't rebellion.  This is the way things are.  Why do I mumble this blah blah blah?   Blame the hour of the day.  After 3 now.  I'm not tired.  Maybe its the mocha I had.  Thanks again Donna, and I will pay you back.    I was talking to God tonight. He says "Hi".  That's   Justin's joke .  It's funny.  Seriously, I was praying tonight and it was good.  It's always a blessed occassion to conversate with Him.  I pray out loud as I take walks.  Someone muttered something from across the street.  I thought for sure they had heard me.  I started praying inside my head.  There's just one more reason for them to think I'm crazy.  And maybe I haven't grown up but at least I'm not out tipping over convenient stores or garage sales, unlike my brother Daryl.  That boys a genius let me tell you.  You know, Daryl, as upset as I get at you, I still care.  I mean we're family.  I'm required to.  I'll see you on visitor's day.  I'm still sorry for ratting you out.     Sometimes I forget who I am, so I just make stuff up.
