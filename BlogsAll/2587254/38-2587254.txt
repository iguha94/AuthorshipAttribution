2/17/04   ONLY 1 MORE DAY UNTIL HUNTSVILLE!   WEE! I can't wait. Only two more  days until we drive four hours into the middle of nowhere, play for some hick school then head for the Deerhurst^_^. Wow. What trip could be better than that? Gr. 11 NYC trip, which I am looking forward to.  I'm really tired....so I think that I'll summarize my school day:  -Woke up -Music was boring -Science we had a sub....Mr. Curphey broke his leg so we have a sub for the week -Lunch we went to McD's -Bio was fun...blood pressure measuring is funny and I felt my heartbeat. 60 bpm hehehe. -English was funny. Romeo and Juliet is hilarious when people in your class read it. Elaina can't really figure out how to read without laughing, and Lilian kills literature reading w/ a monotonous voice.  And that was it. Basically. And bus ride home talked to Dejan and Elaina. Took Cherryhill today instead of Whitehills as I was too lazy to wait for Whitehills. So I ran for the Cherryhill. I make sense huh =P. Me and Dejan talked a lot about programming class. Though Hyperstudio is an embarrasing program, Dejan has a pretty sick "The Matrix" Slideshow. I was surprised how nice it was. Well after that I got off my bus...then walked home. Originally I was gonna breakdance after school but no stereo >=(.  Well yeah today was pretty short. From 5-7 it was SC. Then eating. And Now I go do h/w.  Not too exciting....but on Saturday i'll have a blog for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. So yeah that will have to be summarized lol. But yeah. I'm kinda lazy today so this is my blog. *Poink*  WAIT! ALmost forgot. New Haircut lol. And also...yeah that's basically it lol.
