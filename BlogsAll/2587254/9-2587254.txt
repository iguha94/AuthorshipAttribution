1/21/04   Multitasking....exams inch closer and closer   As I'm speaking.....er writing right now, I am also listening to music, studying, and on msn. Wow multitasking......what would I ever do without it? Uhh...single-tasking?  Well life's been average like usual, nothing much happened....I mean it's London. No murders, suicides, but there was a sewer gas explosion in downtown a few days back. There's still maintenance on that accident. Lol sewage gas exploding who woulda thought. Blogging has been kinda slow I realize lately.....not as much effort as before....so tonight I'll try to make this one another average Joe blog....  It was band today....."woot." Not. Like usual I woke up at 6, did usual morning routine....and jumped out the door around 6:45 or so. I got there think 5 minutes late. Not like Mr. Clark cares....but he does get pissed off when people don't go to band. We sounded ok I guess........one song sounded like crap.....but the Fugue sounded good. Oh yeah Zavitz got his red Adidas track suit. Makes my black one look kinda degraded. Argh Now I want a red one.....or a green one. Wait...green? Weird. I wanted a red one....but I'm not just about to bite someone else's style. Black track suit for me. I'll get a blue one eventually. Hmm.....not much else happened....oh yeah Meaghan stuck to her Wednesday Track Suit thing....she seems to always wear it on a Wednesday like she said lol. Well now I'm off to rant about music class.....  Well at first we sounded good......but then we started playing scales. We sounded like....*shudder.* It was the worst....and I think he was bulding up momentum to his PMS state.....because after we started playing another song.....and Connor and Arjun entered at the wrong bar......he was like PMSing. "Releasing his Tiger" according to Mr. McCumber. Wth? I just call it PMS. Music class was pretty funny though. Thompson was dressed as a "wanksta" with a tambourine around his head. Watch out reppin' the T-Crew. And Justin Deyell desperately tried to get his civics commercial together......Lol that was just terrible. Then after the PMSed Mr. McCumber, crap commercial, and crap playing.... came announcements and off to second period.  Now science was boring like usual......did lots of notes.......Well keep scrolling down to the next part nothing to write about here....  Now we are into lunch. It was Ally's B-day *Happy B-day Ally!* and so we went to Jasper's Cafe....  SO DAMN EXPENSIVE! But meh......nice place though.....and it's worth it....sorta. The poutine had actual gravy and not that XOXO crap from A&P, and it wasn't bad. Chris left a bit early for some reason......and the rest of us ate for a while. Mike got the sweetest meal....swiss mushroom melt burger w/ fries and tropicana jiuce.........all for 7 bux. Not bad considering the quality....beats Williams. And a lot of people came today. Pokan, Hermann, Eddie, Steve, Mike, Ally and her posse of people, Jessie, Wilson, Brescia, And I think the girl's name is Suzie (spelling?). And now we are all heading back to school. I'll consider going to Jasper's again. Not bad of a place....and it's more luxurious than William's I think.  Now off to bio. we did work. Lab, worksheet, lots of crap. Once again I zoned out at the wrong time and misheard the instructions.....causing Ms. Wiener to once again poke fun at my zoning out at the wrong time. Well in the end Robert told me what was going on but I am so out of it in Bio.......sleep time I think. Well we didn't really do much else......yeah even if we did it's not important. Off to English.  English was amusing. We had to temporarily be evicted from our usual room due to re-painting, so we just read this class and listened to Mrs. Gayed read for almost 40 minutes. Then we had to answer a few questions out loud....then PICTIONARY! Total Chaos lol. with lots of yelling of random movies......and of course random body parts too from people like Kurtis. We have very artistic people in our class...for forrest gump some person drew two legs with holes....and someone yelled FORREST GUMP. I'm surprised lol. well now the bell's rang by now....talked to some people......set tomorrow for studying @ Jason's house.....and while I'm at it play NFL street....wanna see what the game's like.  I actually talked for a while, then I ended up running out the door when I was stopped by Steph Bourdage. It's been like the 10th time she told me to write about her in my blog. Someone is just a bit greedy about fame. I mean first of all it's a blog I'm writing in. I only get like 20 views a day....maybe 30.....honestly I doubt some person will read this and go OMG STEPH!?!!!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? Then again sewer gas exploded under Galleria so who knows....=P. I then met up with Steve and Eddie and walked to my stop. Talked to them for a bit. Found out Eddie used to run....a lot. But now they had to go another way....sooo.... Well now I rush to my bustop...  DAMNIT! Forgot King street's blocked off....so I had to run down dundas trying to keep up with the 9A....when then all of a sudden the Dundas shows up. I KNOW! I'll take the Dundas....then transfer at next stop.......how smart of me ^_^....and it worked lol. Some other kid *Rui-Ming by name I think * was surprised how fast I got to that stop. He ran his ass off while I sat.....literally. Heehee......slacking off to its maximum. Well I walked home after I got off bus....and then sat on MSN for a bit, ate a lot. Oh yeah sent Thompson "Quake in Real Life." He seems hysterical about it....there hasn't been one person that hasn't laughed at that video....then my mom FINALLY took me to go look at a new monitor.....  Car ride was pretty amusing. Lots of snow......I slept. Mom woke me up when we arrived....for some reason she parked near the end of the lot when there was a space right beside the store....sorta. Well didn't matter for me.....I kinda got used to the cold from walking home from bus stop. Well I ended up putting down an order for a Samsung 17"LCD....model's like 170 or something like that. YES ONLY A WEEK OF WAITING! Can't wait. My monitor right now....7 years old....and probably produces more radiation than a Nuclear Power Plant. So now all i have to do is withstand this monitor for another week and WHOO! NO MORE RADIATION! well some but not as much. Now I go to Dragon Court to pick up dinner. And off to home....  Got home.....played some NFSU......sat around.......did some stuff......then  dad came home. I had to shovel the driveway.......AGAIn. And then off to theory.  Theory was usual.........didn't do much but I should catch up soon. Everyone was dead tired.  And back here now..........on the comp.....studying...........looking around.......gonna eat soon......gonna practice Trombone soon......MSNing.......LIstening to music. Gotta still do Devos too. Wow I'm really stressed out right now. I just hope  that HYPE prayers list got through to everyone too. Seems as though sometimes it doesn't work with some emails. Well I'm gonna go finish up work then do Devos then sleep. Cya people later.
