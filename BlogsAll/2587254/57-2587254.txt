3/28/04   The "wonders" of MSN   First off before anything else....my prayers do go out to Cecilia Zhang's family right now as today they found  her dead in Missisauga. I pray that the Lord be with their family at this time of grieving and that the close family and friends of the Zhangs may also be with them at this time.  Well I just woke up from a 3 hour nap *Naw didn't do anything in the end w/ Colin and Paul* and after a shower and dinner trudged downstairs to work on my science lab when then I find myself in a huge group convo with the following message:  "Everyone put an X @ da beginnin of ur name to pay respect to Cecillia Zhang whos body was found in a Missisauga Ravine earlier yesterday morning. Pass this on to every1 on your list"  First of all I had a deja vu feeling....but I'm not gonna talk about that. I'm just finding it kinda interesting how almost 60% of the people now have X's in front of their MSN name. It looks cool.....but honestly how many of them I'm wondering actually got a emotional punch from hearing it? How many actually have their MSN name written w/ a "X" for a reason and how many actually go with the crowd? Another point my friend John Li pointed out is why put an "X" for her and not every other person that dies in this world. That is a point that kinda got me thinking.....if humans are equal...then why don't we respect those who pass away like this everyday?  Then again........it is only MSN. So I hope people don't take it as though if you don't have an X,C,O, or w/e in front of his/her name.....it doesn't mean they are mean ruthless people. I mean it's what's in the heart that counts that an old friend of mine Gavin Docherty also pointed out.  But yeah it is upsetting how everyone had so much hope *I mean even I had thought they'd have a chance of finding her* but after today...that candle flame has just burned out. May her spirit be with the God Almighty now.
