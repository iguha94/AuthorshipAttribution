2/27/04   A Relaxing Friday after a Stressed out week........shweet   FINALLY! As if it hasn't came slow enough. This week was one of THE slowest weeks I've ever had. Though it was slow, it still did have its good times. The week after Huntsville......LOTS OF PICTURES! Some of them were hilarious too. Saw a pic of me and Mitch where I was catapulted almost from it, and also we the mass pics of the rock paper scissor wars. It was overall a good week. Good recovery from Huntsville. I liked the week. Entertaining, fun, and of course work *shudder.* But it all ended off with a pretty good friday. Though I'm still horrible at windmills, I've found a new move to try working on: Inverts=P. But I need new pics for breaking, and also I need to get windmills. Argh. But anyways off to the beginning of my Friday first.  Got to school around 8:10, so basically I went straight to music. Saw some people there already, and looked at some Huntsville Pics. I think they were Rebecca's pics. Also made fun of Thompson and his crummy piano playing. But yeah today was usual, played music, Mr. McCumber I think had therapy or something.....he hasn't got mad in two days. NO WAY! Oh yeah and saw Mrs. Wharton. She's coming back after March Break. WHOO!!!!!!! YAY! FINALLY! ONLY 5 MORE CLASSES OF McCUMBER OPPRESSION! 5 MORE CLASSES OF DICTATORSHIP.......BEFORE ONCE AGAIN BEING........umm............well a NICER DICTATORSHIP! WHOO! And then to science.  Did a physics test today. I'm actually kinda considering turning to sciences for my University career, cuz I do get decent marks in it, and it does kinda beat number crunching. But basically today we had a test, and I think I did ok on it.  Lunch....went to Jaspers, I think I scared Eddie w/ my cheap imitation of him.....with the "Hi Joe............." well yeah instead of that it's now "Hi Eddie................." OK n/m lol. Anyways yeah, chatted w/ Thompson mostly, since we kinda ditched the others when they wanted to go to some crap sub place for lunch, and yeah talked to Monica a bit.....and the person she went out for lunch with........Krutika her name? Pretty cool name actually. Well me and Thompson left early, and we kinda saw Jaime Christian walking back to school, so chatted with him for a bit. Apparently Justin Deyell thinks he's the BIG MAN now since he dissed Thompson with one of THE cheapest shots ever. Well today Thompson couldn't find this motor thing for the Vibraphone, and when he said "I can't find it" Justin mutters "your penis." HA. Ha. ha. NOT! Geez if Justin ever gets to read this entry......YOUR JOKES SUCK! WOW...........that's real original isn't it. Wow he's 'bout the biggest smurf I've ever met. Honestly.....he coulda at LEAST said it to Thompson's face. Might have had A WEE BIT of effect....like Thompson whooping that kid's sorry ass. Honestly if you're gonna diss someone with a crap diss like that.....at least go up to them and say it. But all in all....yeah dude *Justin Deyell* Get a life.  And then off to bio. It was a pretty fun class today. Day 1 of presentations. The people did the Lymphatic system. Unfortunately they had some technical difficulties w/ the powerpoint presentation *Tommy they used powerpoint* and couldn't get it on the big screen. So they improvised with a long video, and one of the members of the group lecturing about the Lymphatic system. I tried helping too, but I failed to get it to work =(. Yay for my techie skillz. Boo.  And English we read, and was reminded about the upcoming book report.......and yeah that's basically it.  I'm blogging as fast as I can today because I still gotta practice my cheese piano, so bear with this lame blog. I'm gonna MAYBE get 5 hits from this blog probably lol. Well anyways.......  Dan came over after school........we chilled, got LOTS of food, and just talked about random crap. And played PS2. DDR......I BEAT HIM IN ONE SONG! Forgot which one BUT I BEAT HIM! AMAZING! Practice for the DDR Competition tomorrow...........on a controller? Meh. Lol. Dan should enter the DDR competition though......he's actually really good for a grade 9 kid. But he says he'll "consider." Hmm what else.........OH YEAH! We totally fooled Calvin over MSN lol. We were both on MSN, and we were talking to Calvin, and somehow convinced him we were at two different houses. Got him goin on with that for almost........30 minutes? Yeah it was pretty funny =P. Sad how he couldn't figure out I was typing for the both of us. Sad Calvin just sad lol. And then UCC.  There were a few of us @ Session today. Calvin came too. Steve, Igor, Spencer, Stefan, Mike, Evan, Joseph *FuFu if I spelled it right* and some other people.  Well anyways today I still have crappy millz, Lost most of my power moves, but I still have Handstand Hops ^_^. And I still need to work on the following:  -Millz -Turtles(Smooth them out) -Smooth out crickets -Airchair -Inverts*NEW* -Tabletop to forearm to handstand to hops *MY YEAR GOAL OTHER THAN WINDMILLS* -Footwork -........  OK YOU GET THE POINT! I HAVE TO WORK ON EVERYTHING BASICALLY! ESPECIALLY STYLE! I've come to the conclusion of I HATE FRIGGIN POWER MOVES! But I like to try inverts....fun move. Had to leave early today though so I can rush home to still do retarted piano lessons.  And now.....talking on MSN......and blogging. Lindsay and em are over at Sarah L's right now.........Karaokeing? *Sigh* I thought only my family still did that lol. But nope.........apparently it's pretty popular among lots of people now. Makes me kinda want to get Karaoke Revolution lol. But yeah........I heard much about their desperate struggle to get it to work w/ the TV *How hard is it?* and heard much about.........their boredom of being on MSN......impatience w/ hooking up the Karaoke......and Caitlin's Belly flopping *WTH?! Lol.* Anyways yeah..............sooooooooo................ANYWAYS..............  So now.......I must go. But before that.............Hmmm.......To go to the DDR competition? Or not? HMMMMMMM..........................I'll decide later =P. Cya.
