3/31/04   Another month gone by....   Bah March is already over. How could I ever have thought time passed by slowly? I have no clue. But these last three months have been such a blur. And yes tomorrow will be the first day of April.....am I enthusiastic about it? NO. The only reason why I'd even like the month is because it marks the fact there's only two more months of school. Other than that....rain, worms, and work.....eew. At least Easter is during April ^_^. Hmm......but I'm happy March has gone by in a way. HUGE Bio seminar is finally over and  done, and my school average is at a healthy 85 ^_^. Shweet....so yeah March has been a good month.....and of course who could forget TC?! AMMMMMAAAAZZZZIIIINNNNNNGGGG. I just hope April will pass by as quickly as March....same for may.....and June.....then July and August......SLOW PLEAAAAAAASE.  Well this morning was Wednesday so another day of waking up really friggin' early. Yay....Intermediate band. Seems like such a joke after Senior Band just passed by on Tuesday. And I thought the music was a little bit difficult.....wow I can't wait until Gr. 11 next year. Music is actually amusing then hehe. Like usual....trombones sound good ^_^ and like usual Mr. Clark yells at woodwinds. Really the trombone/baritone section....really good section ^_^...  And after band music.....MORE MUSIC! Yes today was day two so I had music homeroom. Ran over music like usual....scales and such and then Mr. Clark took all the brass and we played some brass ensemble thing. So boring.....and we sound like crap lol. But Mr. Clark kept talking about how he gave Connor the lonely part so he'd suffer for all the trouble he causes in band lol. "Mr. Clark what have I ever done?" "Want me to give the list in order? *ehem* Talk to Kurtis, Listen to Kurtis, Talk back to Kurtis...." etc. etc. It's pretty funny though watching Mr. Clark seem to have this "master" plan. Oh yeah and Zavitz got these KILLER pair of shoes. THERE'S A STORY WRITTEN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SHOES. Now THAT's unique. So yeah that was basically the whole music class.....being split up and playing music. Fun.  Science..........MORE NOTES! Some cheesy poor-graphic animated video about VECTORS. Wow.......1980's animation was horrible lol. But it was funny watching it in the making haha.  Lunch.....went to Galleria. What?  Bio......................................wow the people that presented today for bio class.......whipped right through it. Their notes were up for about 3 seconds a time......and yeah writing down the notes.......NEAR TO IMPOSSIBLE. It was a pretty cool presentation though....was about digestive system. One of the group memebers apparently has had life experience with some of the things that they presented. So yeah that made it pretty interesting actually. But yeah they kinda went through presentation a bit fast.....so no one really could take down any notes lol.  English.......OUR PLAY IS AMAZIN'! AMAAAAAAAAAAAASHING AAAH! UNSTOPPABLE! I actually can't wait till we present it on Friday.......it's actually a pretty funny play. So we spent most of the time rehearsing...then just sitting around and chatting......yeah it's a cool play though. Romeo and Juliet......FOB/Matrix/Mr. Bean style. REALLY messed up but funny hehehehe.  Bused home.  And now I'm blogging.......yeah my blog formats are all beginning to look the same. I still need to learn HTML and stuff.....or maybe how to use Dreamweaver in a productive fashion hehe. As of right now.......what's a Hyperlink? j/k I'm not that stupid. At least I can make my background sit in one spot now heehee. Hmm what do I have to do today........catch up on theory.......memorize English script......practice piano if I have time. Yeah my night's gonna be filled with crap. AWW NUTS I still have to do that canvassing thing. Well.....so far I have $5. Lol out of 10 people ONE PERSON donated. I'm gonna be puttin' in 10 though and mom's puttin in 20. So altogether...........$35 DOLLARS. WAAAH. Yeah but note to self: NEVER CANVASS DURING MARCH AGAIN. Wow it's FREEZING or it's SOAKING WET. I just hope I can finish at least 20 houses by tonight.  Well........so much for canvassing. In the end.......after canvassing whole Walmer Gardens.....TWO out of over 20 houses donated. *Shrug* maybe next time I do this I'll do it earlier in the year lol. So plus me and my mom donating the total $$$ made: $40!!!! Meh not much....but I hope it go into good use.   After coming back from that canvassing.......I went to drum for a bit....Hmm since one of my toms is broken decided to do a new drum layout. instead of 5-piece I do 4-piece set. Snare, tom, floor tom, and bass. So far....it's not bad. In fact I kinda like it ^_^  Well.....yeah I'm pretty much done for tonite.....got piano theory still and stuff. So until my next entry......KEEP FIT AND HAVE FUN *body break dun dun dun dun dun dun.* Hehe j/k j/k.....just have a nice day =P. Later.
