1/4/04   BlAST! SKOOL AGAIN!? @(#*&@&*@(&^!   Well.............the Christmas holidays sure wrapped up quick. Two weeks already. And boom. back in my desk tomorrow......er chair for music class........i mean u can't exactly play a trombone w/ a desk in front of you. ANYWAYS.......yah for a last day wasn't too amusing. Had to work on project and stuff......and basically just moped around the house.  Well Worship didn't go bad today. Other than the fact we screwed up one song........the other 5/6 were good......oh yah our response Gavin kinda changed strumming patterns 30 seconds into the song, which made me basically wait until the chorus before i started playing. Sunday School was just sitting around again....played who wants to be a millionare....with Christian questions since we are in a church. It was nice to see some of the UWO kids back today though. Funny, i'll be one of those old people in a matter of 3 years. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET OLD =P.  After  church i ate Dim Sum @ Loang Hing Gok. *Josh if your reading this its LOANG not LUNG or LING or w/e its LOANG* and then Wendy's family came over to look @ my newly renovated........main floor. whoopteedoo.....up till now i think 4800 bux on stupid hardwood flooring is a rip. Oh well but it looks nice I guess. I wish my basement was hardwood flooring.  Anyways......I'm getting terribly lazy about writing emails.......well the memories of 2003 and well the first 4 days of 2004 where there was no school will be in my head for a while.......obviously not forever I mean seriously my long term memory isn't even good enough to remember that "But how the heck can I remember the times tables?" Write more tomorrow. *Ponk*
