1/20/04   TRIUMPH IN MATH CLASS! Oh yeah and uhh....more snow.   WHOO HOO! After much studying and hard work........IT'S PAID OFF! 86% on my math midterms! SHWEET! This will take me outta the 70's. Well at first I thought all that work for nothing because I didn't answer 3 questions.......but thanks to good old multi choice......I have suceeded! Today's day actually wasn't bad... not much work. Got my careers presentation over with...and yeah that's basically it.  Well today Patrick was sick.....so instead of getting a lift from him my mom had to drive me to school today. Was about 5 minutes late since I was notified around 7:40 or so.......but that's ok it's only history. I wasn't the only one late. More people came afterwards. Well we copied down exam outline. Ms. Manson was yelling like usual about our loudness. Well "yelling." She couldn't yell if her life depended on it. And we got some review Q's to help us. Then came announcements and off to careers...........  Careers......I finally presented. I think it went well. In the end I ranted a bit about why I sorta changed my mind on job career path from CGA to something different......but now that I'm doing good in gr. 10 math......tides have turned. And then we went to a winter sports team assembly. Guys Bball, Girls V-Ball, and hockey of course. Then there was curling. Lol. And we honoured the junior boys volleyball team who won WOSAA, and X- Country and Girls senior bball team....who all won something. Then Ms. Young-Kipp was ranting about how we really need a gym floor. I agree. I hate tiling. Sucks. And then lunch.......  Mmmm......BK......like usual.  Now time for math. This is where I found out I got a good mark on midterms. Mike did too. Half our class failed. Whoo hoo. I forgot what the hell I did in that class. Oh yeah we had to write "goals." Mr. G. gave me half a sheet of paper by accident instead of the whole thing....so I had to glue together the two he gave me. 90 degree angle writing. skillz...........  Now time for programming.....uhh........no action......no circle strafing from Icy beating Pokan. Nothing. Just pure boredom  Now to summarize the time from 3-10........  Came home, ate lots of food, SC, drummed, showered, ate more, did h/w,, played trombone,  played NFSU, watched TV, ate,played piano, blogged, fixed blog site, read stuff, twidled thumbs, looked around, drank milk, stared at comp screen and typed on MSN, yawned, and now I'm gonna sleep. Cya.
