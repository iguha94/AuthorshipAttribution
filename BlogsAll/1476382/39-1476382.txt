          Kabbala Red String Theory   Those cats at  The Smoking Gun  are at it again! Scooping the mainstream press, they give us the goods on  Paris Hilton , who, when she is not wearing a black wig and  keeping it on the down low , is wearing   Kabbala red string to ward off bad mojo .  Now I know what I want for Christmas: some  Kabbala red string!    The Observer's   Simon Doonan   was a   precog on the Kabbala thing , but he has another plan for Partis' image rehabilitation:  " FINAL DAY :  First outing . No, not the  Ivy  or the  Kabbalah Centre   ( The Corsair  is shiverring now, because Doonan wrote this days before the fact) or some other tragically trendy, paparazzi’d destination: I’m talking about lunch at  Le Deli Grandeville , a public eatery located in the basement of 450 West 33rd Street. This inappropriately monikered, unglamorous canteen feeds a wide spectrum of earnest hard-working New Yorkers, including the employees of  Lerners ,  Channel 13  and Doubleclick.  Le Deli Grandeville  will be Ms. Hilton’s big opportunity to find out, via supervised conversations, how the other half live."  Hey, Doonan, can you gaze into your crystal ball and tell me if you see  The Corsair  hooking up with the  BBC's  sexy Washington Correspondent  Katty Kay ?
