          Eminem Rescues Suicidal Ex-Wifey   Significant cultural artifact   Star Magazine  reports that Eminem "rescued" his troubled (read: insane in the membrane) ex-wife and lyrical muse  Kim Mathers .  Livin la Vida Loca  with America's favorite "dramedy"  The Mathers Family.  (produced by  Assad Kelada , of course, laugh track optional)   Let me try and untangle this twistedness for you, my little pomegranates.  In the pilot episode, follow me as  Kim Mathers  disappears for two weeks in November, missing court appearances for drug charges in Michigan.   But Kimmy not only vanishes without a trace, she cuts off the  ankle tether  issued under court-ordered house arrest ( The Corsair  rolls his eyes and says nothing).  Oh no, she didn't!  (roll laugh track) What will that  wacky  chick do next?  Star reporter  Bob Hartlein  reports in the latest issue that Eminem's uncle,  Todd Nelson , told him, "I heard she had planned to kill herself down in Cancun, a place she's always loved, and where she wanted to die."   Thanks for sharing , Uncle Todd.   Nelson , the source for the story, told Star, "Eminem persuaded Kim to turn herself in and posted her $50,000 bail. He also claims Kim is upset about having to receive in-house drug treatment in January, noting, 'She's threatening suicide again.'"  Nothing says loving like a court-ordered ankle tether ...  A family under house arrest stays together ...  Uncles who tell family tales to tabloids ...  Well,  you get the idea.
