          The Charlie Rose Drinking Game   The art of the interview is to draw out the subject while the interviewer recedes into the background. Although  Charlie Rose  delivers the goods on any given weekday, he uses the first person singular personal pronoun often.  Excedingly  often. Okay: all the damned time. Charlie, thank you for giving us those great interviews with  Kiefer Sutherland  and  David Westin  and  John Kerry , but honestly: It's not all about  you . All those  I's  and  me's  Charlie, puh-lease.  So, in the spirit of Charlie Rose's  energetic  use of the  first person singular personal pronoun ,  The Corsair   proposes  The Charlie Rose Drinking Game . It's late at night, it was a hard day at work, you are about to go to bed and Charlie is interviewing some  Master of the Universe  -- so why not have a drinkie poo on the Chuckster?  Every time Charlie uses the first person singular personal pronoun, down a shot.   And don't use any of the cheap stuff, ladies and gentlemen, this is Charlie Rose and that whole "corridors of power Illuminati Trilateral Commission" thingie we're talking about.  You better recognize .  As  Garry Kasparov  is tonight's guest,  The Corsair   would like to suggest vodka, preferably Stolichnaya.
