          Grover Is Evil   Every fairy tale has a villain. Do you remember all the hullabaloo several years ago when cultural investigators finally figured out that   Bert from Sesame Street was really a passive aggressive evil puppet ? Well, they forgot to mention Grover ...  Grover Norquist  that is. There is no way to underestimate the evil genius of  Grover Norquist ,  Karl Rove's  best friend, one of the dirtiest players in Washington, and a man who has the President of the United States on speed dial. He strides the fence on  K Street  like a mighty colossus, bending America and the world at large to his whimsy. Who would have thought that a man named  Grover  could be so dangerous?    Grover  has   made enemies  on the   left  and the   far right  and if he weren't so powerful, he would probably be the latest celebrity criminal. Better yet: he would be a celebrity lobbyist criminal -- and  no one likes lobbyists . But money and influence can sweep away scandal -- just ask the Governator; and very few people living have as much influence as that lobbyist called Grover.  Even conservatives have   trouble with Grover,  who, if I take the meaning of my DC emails, is becoming quite a polarizing figure on the Georgetown scene.  But the most interesting line about   Grover  making the rounds in DC is that he might have been the man who convinced the White House into   airlifting shady Saudi nationals  out of the US immediately   following 9/11 .    This guy  is Darth Vader evil.
