          What Happened to Eduard Shevardnadze?   Back in the day Crazy  Eddie Shevardnadze  was our boy -- remember that? He was down with  James Baker  and  George Bush the Elder  and even Ambassador  Vernon Walters , who used to quip that he could speak eight languages and think in none (too true, Vernon;  too true ).   Now, after two dozen years in power, Shevardnadze fell in for the old autocratic desire for unlimited power. Tant pis. But how did Shevardnadze go from being down with  those Fabulous Baker boys , all presiding over the fall of the Soviet Union into being a petty tyrant from a tiny backwater?  As a rule of thumb,   The Corsair  believes that no head of state, no matter how good, should stay beyond ten years in power.   Now, if  The Corair  could be a benevolent autocrat he would make a modified Great Books education mandatory for all public school kids :  Archimedes  and  Euclid  and  Ptolemy  Math labs; piano keyboard lessons with music appreciation featuring  Monteverdi  and  Bach  and  Beethoven  and  Coltrane ; intensive biology labs with  Harvey  and  Gray's Anatomy , supplemented by freehand drawing and painting of the torso and organs;  African dance  to get the blood flowing; kindergarteners can imitate and learn of cave drawings with charcoal; comparative world religions and myths for the kids' curiositas; and readings of the  Analects of Confucius  and Sun Tzu's Art of War and  Machiavelli's Discourses on Livy   and  Clausewitz'   On War  for political science as well as reading of the  Lincoln-Douglas  debates and the US Consitution.  Nah, who are we kidding,  The Corsair  could never be autocratic; the  PC lobby  and the teacher's unions would run me out of town faster than  Calvin Klein  can pitch woo at  Latrell Sprewell  during a  Knicks  game.  Oh well ....
