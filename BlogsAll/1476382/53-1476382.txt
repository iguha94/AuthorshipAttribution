          The Charlie Rose Drinking Game    The art of the interview is to draw out the subject while the interviewer recedes into the background. Although  Charlie Rose  delivers the goods on any given weekday, he uses the first person singular personal pronoun often.  Excedingly  often. Okay: all the damned time. Charlie, thank you for giving us those great interviews with  Will Ferrell  and  Luca Cordero di Montezemolo , but honestly:  It's not all about you . All those  I's  and  me's  Charlie; it's not all about you.   So, in the spirit of Charlie Rose's energetic use of the first person singular personal pronoun,  The Corsair  proposes  The Charlie Rose Drinking Game . It's late at night, it was a hard day at work, you are about to go to bed and Charlie is interviewing some Master of the Universe -- so why not have a drinkie poo on everyones favorite social climber- cum-interviewer? Every time Charlie uses the first person singular personal pronoun, down a shot.    And don't use any of the cheap stuff , ladies and gentlemen, this is Charlie Rose we're talking about, and that whole "corridors of power Illuminati Trilateral Commission" power nexus. One doesn't just down muscatel with Charlie Rose; you better  recognize .   If you are still conscious after the drinking game, then you are a candidate for the  Jared Paul Stern  Ironman Drinkie-poo competition.
