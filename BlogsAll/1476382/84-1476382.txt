          Older Women are the New Black   Or, More to the Point, Diane Keaton is the new Jill Claybergh   The   Jill Clayburgh Effect  is back in, well, effect. Older women are romping around the national landscape like college girls backstage at a Stones concert. But in the case of  Diane Keaton's    meteoric  rise to sex symbol from author of a book on bad Clown art is the most surprising.   She's got "it" says the   Sun Herald . She's portrayed as "passionate" and "desirable" says the   NY Times .   The Washington Post  goes so far as to call her a "babe."  And she is in a manner of speaking. Her rise comes at the tailend of a year where Tinseltown said: it's okay for older women to be considered sex symbols. Look at  Demi Moore  and   Ashton Kutcher , for one example, and even, the  not old   Cameron Diaz , 31, who is dating  Justin Timberlake , who is   23 . Then, of course, there is the   12 year age difference  between  50 Cent  and  Vivica Fox . Hey,  it's all good.   From   older women-younger men  it was a short hop skip and jump to  older woman as sex object , when you think about it.
