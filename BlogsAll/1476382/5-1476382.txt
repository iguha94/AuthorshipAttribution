          Turning Republican Is Good For Your Career!   We all know Republicans make more money than liberals, but now actually  turning   Republican might also be good for your career. Witness:  Dennis Miller . Miller is moderately funny in a sort of very-near-nervous-breakdown kind of way. For years he has been trying to find his niche in Hollywood: He cannot act (Miller has always been frank about why he could not do skits on SNL), he isn't very  compelling  as a talk show host, and his comedy, well, to be fair: it's just not the type of comedy that assaults you, like, say,  Bernie Macs  does. Miller's comedy sort of lets you smirk at your own smartness for knowing the arcana he throws at you at the speed of a moderately challenging game of Trivial Pursuit.   Let's Face the Music in a very VH1 type of Leif Garrett-level frankness, Dennis Miller was one Call AT&T commercial away from being  Chevy Chase . Or  Carrot Top . Miller himself might characterize his plight in that manner.   But lo and behold,   one time Ross Perot supporter  Dennis Miller, fell in line behind the Republicans using the time worn cliche ("Let's face it, 9/11 changed everything")and chucked any sense of principle behind him and c'est goddam good, non?   Miller is now living large on the Republican dime. He is on   Fox Tv's Boston Public .  Miller is also a commentator for Fox tv, and now   CNBC wants a piece of him . Dennis Miller is like the prettiest girl in school fending offers from all the jocks. But does anyone really believe that a former Perot operative is now  so  Republican that he is willing to run for the Senate? His principles are reversed 180 degrees in a couple of years? He had a Paul in Damascus moment? Yeah, and I've got some Brooklyn Bridge property to sell you.  Forget turning Japanese, turn Republican!
