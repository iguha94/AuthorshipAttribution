          LOTR: The Unbearable Whiteness of Being Frodo   Can we get a  Cablasian  Wizard, please? Are there any Eskimo orcs in central casting,  come on work with me people !   The Corsair  is tired of all the hyperbole launched in the direction of  LOTR .  Really  tired. The whole LOTR madness came along at a time when, after 9-11, the world wanted a clear cut battle between good and evil a la  Harry Potter  and  Star Wars . Fine: I can understand the cathartic need for moral clarity.  And not to make it into a  race  thing (hunker down,  my little pomegranates , you can see where I'm going with this, can't you?), but couldn't you have, like on  latino  elf? Or a  black  hobbit? Would that  interfere  with the  integrity  of the film? This has got to be the whitest trilogy in the history of film.  What's up with that ?  I mean, this is middle earth we are talking about here, not Woody Allen's Upper East Side. And on earth there are many races.  Okay, that's the end of my race rant.   MSNBC's   Larry Terenzi  offers the   only negative review  of LOTR you are likely to read other than my self serving race rant..  Update: " Lloyd Dobler " writes: "Gollum is a straight up brotha! Albeit a weird one."
