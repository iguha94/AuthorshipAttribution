          Are Rock Stars Pure Energy?   Whenever one reads some rock magazine or other there is inevitably a vague New Agey sort of discussion concerning "energy." One reads things like, "dude, the energy of the show was amazing," or, "you could almost feel the energy coming off of  Kid Rock , man." That sort of thing. I find that interesting.  I find it especially interesting because I recently re read  Janice Dickinson's   No Lifeguard on Duty  (BTW:  The Corsair  is also reading former Senator  Gary Hart's   The Patriot,  if you want to know), where the proto-supermodel describes sex with  Mick Jagger :  " The man was indefatigable ... He was pure energy -- kind of spooky, to tell you the truth. I woke up the next morning feeling like I'd been through a war."   That, to me, is interesting in light of all our previous  'discussion' of energy and rock stars. In  Bebe Buell's   Rebel Heart , she describes meeting him" like lightening had struck ." And, "both Steven and I felt a spark, an animal magnetism from the get go, even though -- or perhaps because -- Steven knew I was with  Todd (Rundgren)."   But the most interesting entry in the book is a line about her flying in  Steven Tyler's  private plane:  "Being confined in a tiny area with a person who had the energy of fifty wild ponies was terrifying."   So, Bebe Buell found Steve Tyler's energy "terrifying" and Janice Dickinson found Mick Jagger energy "spooky."  Is scary the new black ? Bear with me guys, The Corsair has a lot of  Aquarius  in him and is fascinated by these things.
