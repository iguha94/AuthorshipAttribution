          Hollywood Studio Heads Hijack Indie Oscar Hopes   If anyone hasn't sold out yet it is  Eugene Hernandez  and the folks at   IndieWIRE . But it seems that even the Indie mini-studios are in trouble.   Jack Valenti , head of the  Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)  (hasn't he been in power for, like, as long as an African dictator?)  has finalized the controversial awards season screener ban which "will only allow tapes for members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences."  In recent years, indie films that might have been overlooked by screeners have recieved nominations. The studio heads of  Dreamworks ,  MGM ,  New Line ,  Paramount ,  Sony ,  Fox ,  Universal ,  Disney  and  Warner Bros  have been criticized by indie luminaries, including:   Darren Aronofsky ,  Todd Field ,  Richard Kelly , producers  Mary Jane Skalski ,  Jeremy Thomas ,  Eric Watson , and  Eden Wurmfeld , and actors  Maggie Gyllenhaal ,  Peter Sarsgaard  and  Sissy Spacek .  Kevin Iwashina ,  Peter Levine  and  Jason Tuchinsky  from  CAA ,  John Lesher  from  Endeavor ,  Julie Yorn  and  Adam Schulman  from The Firm, and David Schiff from  UTA    among others.  While Valenti uses the the anti-piracy argument, there is  no question  that this ruling will all but shut out the smaller independent features for Oscar awards, or even Oscar nominations.
