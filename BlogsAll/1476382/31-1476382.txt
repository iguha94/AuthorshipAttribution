          How Come Movies on the Media Don't Do Well?   Maybe we are all just navel-gazing at ourselves? It is a possibility. How else to explain why we love movies on the media than nearly everyone else in the Western world does? I was wondering how come movies dealing with the media --  i.e. journos, djs, talking heads, editors  -- don't do so hot in their cumulative box office numbers?   Almost Famous , which is perhaps the most beloved journo movie of this age, had a cumulative box office of a measley $31.7 million.  Elf  made that much on its opening weekend!  Even that Steven Glass movie  Shatterd Glass  has earned only about  $269,898 , despite tons of media attention, including  Hayden Christiansen  appearing on  Reliable Sources , as well as tons of raves in everything mediacentric from  Interview  to  The Observer .   Veronica Guerin  hasn't even earned more than $10 million yet, depite -- t ellingly  -- critical and media raves.  Howard Stern's   Private Parts  only earned $40 million, despite his being on every cover imaginable (Can you say  overexposure ? Can you say  ultraoverexposure ? Then again, exposed private parts and Stern go hand in hand,  so to speak ).   Woody Allen  often spoofs the lives of television writers and we all know of his dismal box office numbers, which fly in the face of his East Coast media acclaim.   Let's face it, my fellow media monkeys  we in the media and of the media love ourselves a lot more than the heartland loves us . Don't feel bad, though, cultural elites: I love you, baby.  The Corsair  will always love you and cover your snarkiness with affection. Now, bookmark us.
