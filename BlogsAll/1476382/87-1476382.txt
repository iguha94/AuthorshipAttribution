          Will Someone Give Bill Murray An Oscar Already?   The following article is reposted from November 13th. If you have already read it, sorry, please scroll down. I felt the need to redo it because his   Golden Globe nomination  inches him thismuchcloser to   the Big O :    Oscar  is fickle about comedians. Oscar eludes those who seek him by inducing soft chuckles. That having been said, will someone give the Oscar to  Bill Murray  already?   His performance  in  Sofia Coppola's      Lost In Translation  was brilliantly subtle and nuanced. In fact, it was all nuance: an  anti-performance .  Imagine a Best Oscar going to an underplayed performance.  Denzel Washington's  dirty cop was the most powerful and  full-on  performance in recent years.  Adrien Brody  was a surprise, but in a sense it was the most fully articulated performance among the nominees last year. It would be  wonderful  to have Bill Murray's declining Hollywood actor in a foreign land   shilling whiskey  to win it this time around.   Murray has been snubbed by Oscar. He has never been nominated and that is a crime. Murray was endearing and complex in   Rushmore , but again that was a comedy, so he was hurt at the outset. Murray was a rich personality in   The Razor's Edge . And Murray was overlooked as the dry, intellectually clueless psychiatrist in   The Mighty Tennenbaum's , another comedy, so Oscar ignored.   My favorite Bill Murray flic is   Meatballs , which is also the first film I ever saw so there is nothing intellectual about my love of it. To me, Bill Murray is the coolest man on the planet earth.  So give him an Oscar already.
