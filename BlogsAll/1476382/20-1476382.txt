          The Real World: Not Happening   Finally, after years of vicariously watching that overdone  Bunim and Murray  confection where twentysomethings "hooking up," I can honestly say I'm over  The Real World . Gag me with a fork, I am  done . Watching plants produce chlorophyl could easily top The Real World Paris as far as excitement goes.   I'm not sure why I began to watch this show. I guess in the beginning before we all became jaded on reality tv shows like a hobo on   muscatel  .  The Real World was my crystal meth. And it was good while it lasted, I suppose in the manner of tweak. But I'm over it. Everyone would like to watch attractive twentysomethings get amorous -- wouldn't that explain the porn boom? It's just that watching these pretty but dim bulbs start "businesses" and compete against each other is a bit of a snooze.  The Greeks were great with wisdom.   Cephalus  quotes  Sophocles  the playwright and poet in The Symposium as follows:    Cephalus : . . . "I was present . . . one time when someone asked the poet Sophocles: "How are you in regard to sex, Sophocles? Can you still make love to a woman?" Hush man, the poet replied, I am very glad to have escaped from this, like a slave who has escaped from a mad and cruel master." I thought then that he was right, and I still think so, for a great peace and freedom from these things come with old age . . . . (329 c)."  Well, at 32 I don't need the viagra yet, but like Sophocles I am free from the tyranny of the cruel master The Real World. Basta!
