          Resign Eisner ... Resign    Michael Eisner  will eventually resign for his pathetic management of Disney, his stupid purchase of  ABC , those idiotic themeparks, EuroDisney and other mega-blunders of this public company, but it will not be pretty because Eisner is an adolescent asshole, after the Hollywood ego-driven manner. Shareholders should demand it. I want to see Eisner crying like a bitch being escorted from the premesis, like  Jim Bakker  was years ago before   he complained of aliens .   The following is a blog I wrote on November 19th that is even more valid now that Roy Disney has resigned and called for   Eisner to step down :  Wasn't November supposed to be the month that Eisner either showed some miraculous growth numbers for Disney or he was to be shown the door? Sheesh. Will someone fire  Michael Eisner    already !  We all know that he is antagonizing  Steve Jobs  and the guys at  Pixar  who are singlehandedly saving Disney's bacon.   Michael Wolff  made an interesting comment on Eisner a while ago in his column in New York.   Eisner has made himself indispensible at Disney. He has a large amount of shares and, like an African dictator, he has (consciously) never groomed a succesor. So it would be hard to fire Eisner without greatly affecting the already bad stock price.  Sad that a public company has to be held hostage to the Hollywood tactics of a real punk like Michael Eisner. Will the Board of Directors react? only time will tell.
