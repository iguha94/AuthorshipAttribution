          But What I Really Want To Do Is Executive Produce ...   Whatever happened to wanting to be a writer and creator of an HBO Show? Okay, fine, there is a certain coolness about  Executive Producing , like, say, the great  Michael Hirschorn  does at VH1 on those X Generation nostalgia shows. Even  Sandra Bulloch  is in on the act with  George Lopez . Then, of course, there are  Courtney Cox and David Arquette  and their design-fashion show. (BTW Was that  Courtney Cox  on the cover of  Town and Country ? Has Cafe Society morphed into the Jet Set? Yes, alas, I trace the exact moment when  John Travolta  occupied the cover story talking about his gaudy planes and not, say,  Dina Merrill  talking about the roses she grows in  Newport, Rhode Island  or  Harry Bellafonte  on the  Harlem Rennaissance .) And then there was  Graydon Carter's The Kid Stays In The Picture  that started off the madness. First the End of Irony and now Executive Production mania! Do we blame Canada for this? Now, it appears, everyone wants to Executive Produce.  Steven Soderberg of K Street,  etc, etc,  Will and Jada Pinkett Smith ,  Tom Cruise  Executive Produced his ex wife  Nicole Kidman  in The Others and  Rita Wilson  exec produced My Big Fat Greek Wedding. You know what they say: a family that Executive Produces together .... But what happened to wanting to Direct? When did that all of a sudden become uncool? BTW:   Fellini retrospective at the Guggenheim ; anyone who knows me knows that Mwangaguhunga loves to get his Fellini on .
