          Kutcher Pulls Punk'd   You've got to hand it to  Ashton Kutcher , he knows how to   make an exit  and coin a new verb, "to  punk ." The former model and toyboy of  Demi Moore  is pulling the plug on the red-hot MTV hit show  Punk'd , leaving us all wanting, uhm, (Demi) more.   Foxnews'  web site eulogizes:  " Among Kutcher's victims: singer Nick Lachey, who thought his wife,  Jessica Simpson , had allowed her hillbilly relatives to move their trailer onto his mansion estate, and  Justin Timberlake , who was moved to panic when he thought all his belongings had been seized because he owed $900,000 in back taxes.   "'Today is a sad day for  MTV , but probably a happy day for Hollywood. Celebrities can rest a little easier knowing that the Punkings have ceased,' said  Lois Curren , an  MTV  executive in charge of series development."  But have the punkings ceased? The buzz flying around is that Kutcher is becoming too ubiquitous in his punkings. Hollywood is tipped off to his game. The pranks are getting harder to pull off on jaded, already punch drunk stars. So what better way to snag these unsuspecting A-listers, than to pretend the punking is over.  Or maybe all the  shadenfreude  in the air is making everyone just a little  too  paranoid and it is we who are the punks.
