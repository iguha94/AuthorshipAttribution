          Michael Jackson's Dad: Spare The Whip Spoil The Child   Celebrity means never having to say you're sorry. Or even, it appears, censoring your rambling and incriminating thoughts. Intrepid  Daily News  staff writer  Corky Siemaszko  reports that Michael Jackson's bizarre father,  Joe Jackson (no relation to the mild and affable adult contemporary singer with the same name) admits to   whipping Michael Jackson .  Yes, you got that right: whipping. First Johnny Cash gets his sister in law pregnant and now this!  In a  BBC  interview airing tommorrow, Joe says, "I whipped him with a switch and a belt ... I never beat him. You beat someone with a stick."  Okay,  Kuta Kinte !  Also showing up for the BBC chat was  Majestik Magnificent, Michael Jackson's  "personal magician." No, I'm not kidding here, everything I have written can be verified with a  Lexis Nexis  search. Although  Bonnie Fuller  might have one of her slave/employees hogging it.   Majestik told interviewer  Paul Theroux  that Michael Jackson is "not gay."  When confronted with the fact that the painfully shy Jackson vomits from nerves, his humane father answered, "He regurgitates all the way to the bank."   This interview will explain so very much about the strange man in the mirror who wears one glove and raves about  Macauley Culkin's  lips,  The Corsair  believes.
