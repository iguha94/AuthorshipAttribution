          Sir Mick Jagger Sells Out   It's official: His Satanic Majesty,  Mick Jagger , uhm, make that  Sir Mick Jagger  has   sold out .  This is an especially sad moment for classic rock afficionados as Mick is the embodiment of good old male rebellion, uhm,  was  the   embodiment anyway . He was very  Peter Pan I-won't-grow-up  and that was okay. Somehow, life was worth living knowing that at least  conceptually  someone like Mick could exist in a state of perpetual adolescence, knocking up Brazilian supermodels and shaking his booty on a stage even though well into Middle Age.   Alas , the Mick is no more. He joins a long line of pop-knights, like  Sir Paul McCartney  and  Elton John , but neither of those icons lived anti-establishment lives to the degree of Mick. Even  Keith Richards  admits what Mick is too afraid to say:  Jagger saw the Estrablishment as more attractive than the outer periphery, where he laughed at the squares for so many years, and which has richly rewarded him.   In the end, I guess, we all just want to be on the inside; Mick laughed at the squares, and now he wants to be one.  "I think he would probably like to get the same honour himself," Sir Mick said of Richards, questioning his craggy-faced bandmate's motives.   "It's like being given an ice cream - one gets one and they all want one. It's nothing new. Keith likes to make a fuss."   Richards had said to Uncut Magazine that he did not want to go on stage with someone wearing a "coronet and sporting the old ermine", adding: "It's not what the Stones is about, is it?"   No, it's not.
