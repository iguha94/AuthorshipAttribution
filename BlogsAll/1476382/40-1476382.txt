          Are Corporate Magazines the New Black?   Hey, what's up with corporate magazines? They are attracting some top drawer talent these days. First, the Elder Brother of the New York media elite  Kurt Andersen  went to  Colors , which, admittedly, is not your  typical  corporate magazine; and, for that matter, neither is  Bergdorf Goodman , which is where, among other places, the very cool  Michael Gross  is nesting.  Magazines sponsored by a corporation allow their editors more freedom,  The Corsair  imagines. Then, of course, there is that persnikety question of  moolah ,  cheddar , cash. In this media environment magazines are losing dollars by the fistful and advertisers aren't what they used to be in those glossy, glossy cyber 90s, or even the razzle dazzle  Reagan  years.  One doesn't have to worry about that when you've got a single cash infused entity writing the checks and asking only for the prestige,  the face  of a top notch editor.  It's a good move on all sides,  The Corsair  thinks:  iconic brands  with  great editors . It is a sort of  Medici -like interlocking structure of artist and patron where everyone involved gets a piece of the action.  So, who is next?  Michael Kinsley  at  Apple Magazine ?  Tina Brown  at The  Manolo Blahnik Quarterly ?  Richard Johnson  at  Jaguar ?  The possibilities are endless.
