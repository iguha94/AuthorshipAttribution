          Is Diane Sawyer Tired of GMA?    Diane Sawyer  joined the cast of  Good Morning America  in 1998 to help ABC catch up to NBC's Today. It wasn't supposed to be a permanent gig, but Sawyer is a team player -- whether in the  Nixon  Administration or on  60 Minutes . The temporary position, though, notes   Matt Drudge  may be outlasting it's welcome.   Diane Sawyer began her broadcast career at CBS Morning News and the idea of a long term contract at Good Morning America cannot -- in the nature of the tv news biz and hierarchy -- be attractive. "She desperately wants to give up the vampire hours!" a top production source explained from New York on Tuesday, reports  Drudgereport.com .   This isn't the first sign of unhappiness at the successful GMA. In 1998, Diane and co host  Charlie Gibson  were unhappy with marketing support and threaten to leave the show. On-air support was said to be inadequate because the show's producers were not supplying GMA information far enough ahead of time to be effective.   As of September ABC's GMA caught and passed NBC's TODAY show in many of America's top cities, according to Nielsen ratings.  GMA is ABC's best chance in years to stop the juggernaut of  Today  with  Katie Couric  and  Matt Lauer .
