          George Gurley's Vagina Monologue -- And Mine   Did you read  George Gurley's  Vagina Monologue in the   NY Observer  last week? Positively lascivious. When he was not going on about non-Platonic "cavernous" spaces, he was meeting up with German porn stars in bars off Avenue A (Hey, isn't drinking at an Avenue A bar a little  David Dinkins -era for the hipsters at the salmon colored weekly?) Anyway, we like Gurley, so here's our very own Vagina Monologue. Showing off our liberal arts education, my momologue comes from  Machiavelli's Discorsi Sopra la Prima Deca Di Tiudo Livio, III, 6 : it concerns  Caterina Sforza Riario , a great beauty of her day and a woman Machiavelli thaught of fondly, "(Some conspirators) killed  Count Giordano , their lord, and took his wife and small children. Since they did not see how they could be secure if they did not become masters of the fortress, and the castellan were not willing to cede it to them, Madonna Caterina (so the Countess was called) promised the conspirators that if they let her enter it, she would deliver it over to them and they could keep the children with them as hostages. With this pledge they let her enter. As soon as she was within, she stood on the walls and berated them for the death of her husband and threatened them with every kind of revenge. And to show that she did not worry about her children, she showed them her  genitals , saying she still had the means to make more of them." What an Italian woman!  Machiavelli  knows how to tell a story, dammit.
