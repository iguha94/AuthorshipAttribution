          Has Jump the Shark Jumped the Shark?    Jump the Shark  has   chronicled the moments  when tv shows and bands have put on their leather jackets and attempted to waterski over the holding pens of apex predators to keep their street cred.   Starting as a web site, then slipping into the   publishing  realm, the average Gen Xer felt proud that    John Hein's  ingenious contribution to the English language was becoming a mini-empire of sorts.  I mean  , someone had to hold powerful and shadowy men like Asaad Kelada's  feet to the flame when they hoisted that noxious flame-haired country music child star  Danny Cooksey , aka "Sam" from  Diffrn't Strokes  on us to be "the new cute kid."  Pshaw !  What does any Gen Xer want to do anyway when we are not doing the important things in life? We like to "pop culture reference." And no, I don't know why we do, maybe it's a latchkey thing, I don't know, but boy do we like to make up lists and impress each other with our knowledge of pop culture trivia (for example,  Mr. Drummond  was played by the unforgettable  Conrad Bain , hows that for spiffy? Just don't ask me who played the dizzy  Aunt Sophia ).  Cue to 2004, and the creation of "Jump the Shark" the   desk calendar .  The Corsair  wants to feel the love for JTS, back in the day when it was only a website and was, for lack of a better word,  fresh .  Oh how I chuckled as posters blasted  Janet Jackson's  underwritten character  Cleo  for ruining  Fame , or when that mop haired little girl ruined  Growing Pains  (what's that? Growing Pains was never worth a peep?), or when Edna's Edibles (run by the indomitable  Charlotte Rae , thank you very much) fucked up the whole girls in private school scenario. But the blush is off the rose, dear friends; Jump the Shark has officially bitten the big one exceding it's reach and mandate. Ah well, we'll always have the memories and those cheesy retrospectives on TV Land.
