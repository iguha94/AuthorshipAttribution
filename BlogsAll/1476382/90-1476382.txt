          McGruder Gets Booed At The Nation   Believe it or not, my little pomegranates,  The Corsair  once worked as an intern at   The Nation  on a weekly stipend provided by none other than  Barbara Streisand . Trust me, though, there is  nothing glamourous  about the long hours, intense factchecking under strict deadlines and that tiny "Babs" stipend, although there  was  that unforgettable boozy lunch with  Christopher Hitchens , where roughly twice as much was spent on drinks than on food, in which  The Corsair  stumbled through the streets of NY, weaving in and out of traffic, barely escaping the clutches of death in the form of a delivery truck several times in the process of getting home. Ah,  The Nation : the memories! The hangovers!  So I wasn't surprised to hear that  mildly  funny cartoonist  Aaron McGruder , writer for   "The Boondocks"  was booed at the 138th anniversary Nation dinner attended by  Uma Thurman  and  John Waters , among others. The Nation magazine projects high seriousness into the sphere of politics, but the atmosphere within is playful and as light as Publisher  Victor Navasky's  love of boxing.    McGruder  is a hostile, but   hostility is not a crime , although it is a  social misdemeanor  in the world of  cartoons . Chances are that when one's  eyeballs  come to rest on the  comic  section of the paper,   said person is probably looking for a laugh , and not an attack on National Security Advisor   Condi Rice's sexuality . Just a thought.  And one more thing: if you are getting booed at left institutions like  The Nation  and attacked by the right at   Free Republic ... uhm,  that's not good .  Unless, of course, he wants to be hated by all sides ... which, uhm, is not good.   So:  Along with the robust multivitamin for  Time Magazine's   Joel Stein ,  The Corsair  offers  McGruder  some   Prozac.
