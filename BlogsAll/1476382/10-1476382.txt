          Whatever Happened to the NY Press?   The  NY Press  used to be an interesting read -- all snarky and conservative and above all  relevant  -- and now it has become an Eastern European literary magazine.  What happened!  I once even wrote an article on  The Great Books  for them a la    Alan Bloom  . It was the anti-Village Voice, young, angry, smart and media centric; low on facts, hard on rhetoric: New York Press was the Zeitgeist, it was a dissonant more working class continuation of the  Spy Magazine  tradition. I miss it, god damn it.  Russ Smith  sold it for $2 million, but he should have taken the the great  Taki Theodoropoulos  made him years ago -- $5 million.     The worst hangover I have ever had was after a Taki dinner party at  Elaine's  for sex offender  Scott Ritter  -- I shit you not. Only, he wasn't a child offender at the time, he was opposing  Clinton  and  Hussein  ... it's a loong story. Anyway, the last thing I remember was drinking with Taki and  Chris Buckley  in the back of  Elaine's  arguing over the  Great Books  ... and I woke up very, very sick. Never try to drink a Greek writer under the table. And never,  I mean never , try to outdrink  Christopher Hitchens  ... but that's another story.
