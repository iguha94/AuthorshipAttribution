          Gore Comes To Harlem   Forget about   Cotton , Al Gore has come to Harlem to endorse Dean! But his trip is, uhm,  quixotic  for two reasons:  1) Harlem is the location of the office of  Bill Clinton -- the biggest cat in the jungle -- who is all but against the  Dean  run. Dean is the anti-Democratic candidate (read: Anti-Clinton- Terry McAuliffe  , centrist DLC, moneygrubbing, poll taking, lowdown suckas). So this brings up the thorny question:  why Harlem , Al? Did you really have to take it to the 'hood? So it's like that, brother?  2)  Joe Lieberman , Gore's Vice Presidential pick, was completely   blindsided . Actually bitchslapped is a more accurate description, but try as we might, the image of Gore bitchslapping the stately Senator from Connecticut didn't pass muster. At the very least it was  bad manners , at its worst, um, it's pretty bad (The Corsair can imagine Washingtonians like socialite  Sally Quinn  covering her mouth and whispering into beltway insider  Ben Bradlee's  ear:  oh no he didn't ).  So, when is Lieb going to pull out?  The Corsair  is talking all predictions at  papermag@yahoo.com . My own bet is before the end of December, and his withdrawal will be a nasty   Zell Miller  type affair. We cannot wait to watch how Lieberman handles his treatment at the hands of the Democrats.  At this moment,  Bill Clinton  is sitting in   Sylvia's in Harlem  on his lunch hour, sampling the   smothered pork chops , hungrily eyeing the women of 125th street contemplating his next move.  Bill Clinton's old school like that.
