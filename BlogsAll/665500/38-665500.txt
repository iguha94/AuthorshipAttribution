This weekend, I've been...     Listening to:  I've had Lenny Bruce ("  The Originals Vol.2 ") on a lot, and continuing on with the "Bruce" theme, I was playing a Jack Bruce CD ("  Harmony Row ") tonight! If only I had a Springsteen CD ...   Reading : I started the autobiography "Man Of Honor" by   Joseph Bonanno  (the mob boss). It's pretty interesting reading, but since I already know that he died of old age (and not in jail), I know it's going to skimp on details and pass on any incriminating truths. Still, it's an interesting look at one of the Mafia's key figures.    Watching on TV : Hmmm...well, I had Howard Stern on while I was working on cards last night, and I had CNN on for about 15 minutes today; that's about it really. Oh! I did watch Dennis Miller Live! tonight; forgot about that! I've had a headache all night from playing Computer Games, so I haven't been in the mood for TV at all.    Downloading : I think I've downloaded all I'm going to download for a bit. I'm downloaded out.    Playing : "Star Wars:Galactic Battlegrounds". Very cool game ala "Age Of Empires", I played for about 5 hours tonight, which gave me a killer headache and eyeache. I took some aspirin a while ago and the headache and pain in my left eye are finally beginning to fade. Note to self: don't over do it on the game playing!   Eating : I am drinking 2 Slim fasts a day and eating one meal with veggies in it. I still tend to snack on what I shouldn't though (yesterday: Muenster Cheese, today: Buttered Popcorn). Losing weight is tough, especially for someone like me, someone with absolutely no discipline. Zero. Zilch. Nada.    Feeling : Tired, actually. I would like to just sleep for a week.
