Wiped Out   I woke up thinking I had slept in too late, til 5:00pm or something, but it was only a little after Noon. I had barely slept again. It was storming outside, so I did what any reasonable person would do: I woke my nephew up and dragged him outside into the rain. We wound up having a mud pie fight (Jess got a lucky shot off on me: right in the face!) and then we played Frisbee for a bit after the rain stopped. We jumped in the shower together, fully clothed, and rinsed the mud off our clothes in there. I cooked lunch for us after that. I made Chicken Cordon Bleu with Ramen noodles. Chef Gary! I was pretty beat by then, so I rested on the couch while Jess did   his Blog  for yesterday and listened to the '80's metal I downloaded last night. After he finished, I played with him on the PC awhile, making our own art using   Lite Brite  first, then Windows Paint. When we got bored with that, I tried playing Dr.Mario, mainly for an excuse to lay down in bed, but Jess was bored and wouldn't let me play/rest in peace. After a bit though, my Mom said it was time to take him home so we packed up his stuff and they split. I was relieved that I was free to rest, but at the same time, sad that he was leaving. He behaved better this weekend than he ever had before and we had a better time because of that. After he left, I goofed off on the PC, downloading AC/DC videos and rare songs that feature Bon Scott. That's about it for my night. I need to do laundry still, but after that: BEDTIME!!!
