Monday... So Far   Today started out really crappy. I woke up an hour before my alarm was supposed to go off, then barely slept at all the next hour. I felt like crap when I finally got up. Mom stayed home today, so I managed to make it to work only 5 minutes late. Afetr getting there I found that they'd changed my schedule since I left on Friday. Now they had me working until 5pm today, which normally would be fine, but I almost called in sick today because of how I was feeling and only went in because it was a short day (til 2pm). My cranky boss gave me a hard time about leaving, questioning me about why I wanted to go, where I'd be going, and then making some snide remark about me using the time to "play", like any of it is his business. So I left at 2pm as  I'd planned. Mom got me and we went over to Goodwill where I bought 6 cassette tapes (Beatles "Sgt.Pepper", Aldo Nova "Aldo Nova", Billy Squier "Emotions In Motion", The Byrds "Greatest Hits", The Hollies "Anthology", and The Monkees "Then And Now ... The Best Of"), a book ("  Once A Warrior King " by David Donovan), and 2 padded Maxell cassette tape cases. Grand total: $8.75. I'm not sure, but I think the Billy Squier and Beatles tapes may be bad. It may just be the B deck of my cassette player that is going bad or needs cleaned. Afetr Goodwill, we stopped off at a Greek restaurant I'd never been to before ("Athenian Gardens", I think) and got a gyro and a greek salad for just $6.20. It was awesome! The gyro was struffed, and the salad was pretty good sized and was pretty tasty too. I will have to go back there again. I chowed down! After lunch, I got the mail and was happy to see a payment from a late paying bidder in there, until I opened it. The guy is from Germany, and apparently, he decided that paying me Euros would be a good idea. It wasn't. I needed the money badly too... very disappointing.
