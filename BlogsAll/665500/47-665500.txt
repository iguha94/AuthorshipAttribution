Guitar Shop   Feeling inspired tonight, I took my guitar apart and cleaned all of the metal hardware (except the machine heads), the pickups, I fixed my volume/tone control knobs (I had been missing a knob and a screw for ages), and put brand new strings on. It looks nicer than it's looked in a long, long time, but my fingers are still burning from the damned Naval Jelly! I guess I should have worn gloves like the label said. Oh well.  The next job with the guitar will be to re-set the intonation, which is a big pain in the ass. I may re-adjust the action first though, another pain in the ass job, if I'm feeling adventurous enough. We shall see...  I talked to my friend John tonight and he offered me his Fostex 4-track recorder for $200, which is a fair enough price (I looked on the internet and found used ones for as low as $97), but he's really doing me a huge favor by letting me pay it off $40 a month, which is only $20 per paycheck! How cool is that? He said he'll bring it over next Thursday, when we're supposed to rehearse again. I can't wait! This will be an enormous help to me in composing my songs. I have had a 4-track of my own for years, but it doesn't work anymore, hasn't for years, and I don't know if it's something internal or if it's the adapter. I pawned it once and the stupid ass pawn shop sold it to someone while I was still making payments on it. I made them get it back from the guy they sold it to, and ever since then, it hasn't worked worth shit. I think either the shop or the customer (who was none too happy about having to return his purchase) sabotaged it in some way, because it ran beautifully before I pawned it. I really can't wait to have a working one again! Woo-hoo!
