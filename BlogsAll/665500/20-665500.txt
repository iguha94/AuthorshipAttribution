This week I've been...    Listening to : I have Miles Davis' "  Kind Of Blue " in the CD player again. I had been playing Jimi Hendrix's "  Electric Ladyland ", "  Axis:Bold As Love ", and   "First Rays Of The New Rising Sun " when my nephew was down.   Playing : Playing Dr.Mario off and on... still. I have a few other games, but they all suck. I'm not a big video game person, so I'm fairly content with just playing Dr.Mario. It's just for relaxation anyway, not a hobby.    Reading : Nothing at the moment. I've been dying to start on the Sherlock Holmes book that I mentioned before, but just haven't gotten to it.    Watching on TV : I've been watching "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" regularly, and Howard Stern on and off. Stern's been boring lately. I don't like the shows where he has phony, silicon-enhanced women on just to gawk at them. I like him better when he's joking with his crew and with his "  Wack Pack ". It reminds me of when me and my friends would hang out (when we were teenagers) and just crack on each other mercilessly. I've also been watching "  Dennis Miller Live !" weekly, and the "  Curb Your Enthusiasm " reruns that HBO has been showing.    Downloading : Well, I somehow blew seeing "Star Wars Episode 3: Attack Of The Clones" in the theater, so I'm downloading it now. I can't believe I missed it. I've seen every one of them, from the original one to the last one, in theaters. Maybe it'll return somewhere around here one more time before it's gone for good, I really want to see it on the big screen.    Eating : I got back on my diet, but my Mom and one of my managers at work have convinced me to abandon it. They said eating one meal a day wasn't very good for me, and besides, I really couldn't see that I was losing anything. Back to the drawing board.   Feeling : Tense.
