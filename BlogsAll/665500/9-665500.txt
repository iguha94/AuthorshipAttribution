Wednesday   Got moving around 2:30 pm today. Got showered, and then me, Mom, and my niece left the house around 3:15 pm. We went to Goodwill (I get books cheap there), but there were slim pickings today and I found nothing worthwhile except some LP's (which including some Hendrix),  but all were just too thrashed for my liking, so I bought nothing. We went to another thrift shop, but the results were about the same. We went on to Seminole Music where I checked out prices on acoustic guitars. I figured I'd talk to my sister and brother-in-law this weekend about getting one for my niece, so I needed some prices to give them. From there we went to Express Music, which is run by a guy named Perry, who I dealt with a lot back in the late '80's/early'90's. He had a halfway decent guitar there for $99 (a blue Aria), so I told my Mom about it and she, surprisingly, decided to buy it for my niece right there and then. She got a tuner too, at my insistence. We went from there to Sonny's, where we chowed down ...BIG TIME. I was stuffed! By the time I got home I had a major headache that has lasted all night long. I played around with my niece's guitar awhile, then I played around on the PC. We went out for ice cream after that, and after we got home I went back and did crossword puzzles with my niece. A little later, we watched "Spaceballs" (Rick Moranis was hilarious!) and then "A Shot In The Dark" (Peter Sellers was brilliant!). It is almost 4am now, and I am pooped. My headache is still raging too, so I guess I'll take a pill and hit the sack. My niece is still wide awake and doing more crossword puzzles. Don't know when I'll be up tomorrow. I still need to do my PC stuff, but there just hasn't been any time.
