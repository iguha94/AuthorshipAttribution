Tired   Weird past couple days for me. I've been staying up until 4:00-4:30 am reading "Chickenhawk" and then sleeping terribly the rest of the night. Been going into work with barely any sleep, then feeling nauseous at work from the lack of sleep from lack of food (I don't eat before work). I guess I need to cut that late, late shit out on nights where I work the next day.  Anyway, I finished the book and have started a new one: Chris Darden's "  In Contempt ". For those who don't know, he was one of O.J. Simpson's prosecutors. Should be an interesting read.  Haven't been doing much else all week. TV watching is at a minimum, been playing some Dr.Mario still while listening to Hendrix or my own demo tapes (trying to develope more song ideas). Tonight I downloaded a bunch of crank calls from "Crank Yankers". The ones with   Tracy Morgan  (from SNL) and   Wanda Sykes  have been the funniest! Wanda Sykes especially ("there's a turd in my car!"). I loved her last season on "Curb Your Enthusiasm" too (when everyone thought Larry had an ass fetish!) and on the Chris Rock Show. Funny lady! No big plans for the weekend, probably just going to chill. I don't get paid until Monday, so without funds I'm pretty much grounded. That's cool though, I don't feel much like doing anything anyway, other than catching up on some sleep.
