This week I've been...     Listening to : still on my Tenacious D kick! Will it ever end? I hope not.    Reading : I just finished Kurt Vonnegut Jr's "Jailbird", and have now started Woodward & Bernstein's "All The President's Men".    Watching on TV : the NBA Finals have begun, but I'm not much interested in the outcome. I'd like to see the Nets win, just because  they're the underdogs, but I think the Lakers will win it for the third time in a row. I don't really care either way. Haven't watched much TV otherwise.    Downloading : Live Tenacious D tracks mostly. I also downloaded Howard Stern's complete live radio broadcast from September 11th, 2001. I got very emotional listening to the events of that day, reliving them again. I hope it doesn't merely turn into "a historical event" over time and live on only in history books. I hope that the shock and the anger and the horror that we all felt that day, should  never  be forgotten.    Surfing : Thanks to the books I've been reading, I've been looking on the internet for more info on Sacco and Vanzetti, and I found a couple of sites that had audio of Nixon's Watergate tapes. Sacco & Vanzetti  and  Watergate figure into the storyline of "Jailbird", and "All The President's Men" is, of course, the story of the Watergate break-in and cover-up.    Eating : I have been slipping on my diet lately, not badly, but I just haven't been as faithful as I should be.    Feeling : Melancholy. Sigh.
