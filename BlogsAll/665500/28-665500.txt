Lazy Sunday   Lazy, indeed. I slept, or more accurately, stayed in bed, until 4:00 pm. I got up with a sore back, most likely due to how I was positioned in bed playing Dr.Mario the night before. I went to put my PC on and get online, but found that my modem was not connecting. I unplugged it and let it sit before re-trying it, but it didn't fix the problem like it usually does. I gave up and decided to eat lunch/dinner. My Mom brought home Publix lemon herb chicken (blah, had it twice this week) but she also picked up two sides from Popeye's Chicken: rice & beans and their mashed potatoes & gravy. They ruled! After chowing, I went back to bed and played Dr.Mario for a while (yes, I'm a slug). Eventually I got bored and started reading "In Contempt" again.  Later at night, I went out to check the PC again (Sunday is my eBay listing day) but it was still not connecting. I called Verizon, my cable modem company, twice, but got absolutely no help from them. I am not real happy with those folks. I'm supposed to have broadband, but when I try to open videos on websites (like on comedycentral.com), I have to chose the 56k connection rather than the broadband connection or else it won't play right. For $42 a month, broadband had better be broadband. I'm considering trying DSL or else going with Roadrunner. Anyhow, it wasn't until about 10:30 that my connection started working again, too late to list any auctions tonight. I'm not real happy about that either, that money helps out a lot.  So now it's 11:30pm and I'm getting ready to do my laundry. Pretty boring day.
