Nightmare   WARNING: Not For The Sqeamish!!   I'm NOT kidding!!  I had a really bad dream last night which really gave me the creeps. It's probably the most horrifying dream I can ever remember having. Here goes...  I dreamt that I had a mass of tiny pin-sized white worms boring holes into my body while I desperately tried pulling them out. I was throwing them to the side in giant handfuls. Some poked out through tiny inflamed holes on my legs and belly and I pulled them out, some came out, but some broke off inside. At one point, I pulled a giant worm out from near my ribs and was shocked at how large and slimy it was. As I pulled it out of my body, I could see the rest of it pulling out under my skin. While I was extracting that one, the little ones were still working. They ate my right forearm almost hollow and through a hole in the skin (more like a tear) I could see them squirming around inside, eating me alive. I kept reaching into the hole, pulling out worms; sometimes handfuls of them, looking like bloody spaghetti. I kept getting the feeling that I was being overcome, that resistance was futile, that I was a goner for sure.   Then I woke up.   I am not a dream interpreter, but I know this one can't be too good. My guess is that it's about dying and the inevitability of death. If we dream dreams for a reason, then the true purpose of this one is a bit baffling to me since I already know and accept that death is a certainly in life, and that someday, I will die. Maybe it's a forewarning of a terminal disease, like Cancer, for instance. Maybe it simply means that time is running out, a wake-up call, if you will, to do the things that need to be done before it's too late to do them. But then again, maybe it's just a dream and nothing more. I don't know, but it gives me the creeps to think about it. It's all speculation, but one thing is a definite certainty: I'm not eating spaghetti for awhile.
