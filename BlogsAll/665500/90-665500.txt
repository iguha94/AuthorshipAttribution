Waiting, Waiting, Waiting...To Rock!   I have the money for the expensive guitar pedal I want, but none of the eBay auctions for it go off until tomorrow night. It's killing me. I am so anxious to have this thing in my hands, though with eBay, there's no guarantee I'll even win it. Luckily, there are a couple of them on this week. What it is is a Foxrox Captain Coconut 2 pedal, which will give me  the  Hendrix sound. It's really 3 pedals in 1: an Octavia, a Univibe, and a Fuzz. I already have a Wah, so if I can get this pedal, I will be abale to emulate, and hopefully build on, the Hendrix sound. I can't wait! The pedal costs $399 new, but they've sold on eBay for as low as $300, which is about what I'm counting on.  I'm supposed to jam again on Thursday. I can't wait! I have a few more of my own songs I want to introduce this time, and hopefully jam on. John said he wrote lyrics and some music for my reggae-ish tune in A. I hope it fits with what I had in mind. We may have a drummer this time too, which would be awesome! It should be fun. I'm probably going to play through JP's miked up Fender amp rather than through the Marshall amp this time; my tone sucked horribly last time. I'll have to bring along my fuzz face for distortion. I should bring my tuner too, I forgot it last time. I'm ready to rock, baby!
