This week I've been...    Listening to: Jimi Hendrix at the Winterland Ballroom, San Francisco, California, from 1968. He did 6 six shows in three nights there on October 11th-13th, and I've been listening to the official release (long out-of-print), "  Live At Winterland ", which features performances culled from all three nights. I also have   3 bootleg CD's  that feature almost all the shows in their entirety and have been listening to that as well. I've also been playing some of the tapes I made of myself (rough ideas and whatnot) and am trying to get some material ready to jam with my friend, John, and his drummer, Jimmy, in a few weeks.   Playing: Still playing a lot of "Dr.Mario". I'm officially addicted.   Reading: Nothing at the moment. I'm going to start a new one tonight or tomorrow, probably "Chickenhawk".  Watching on TV: I have "South Park" on ("Insomniac with Dave Attel" comes on after it), but am not really watching it. I haven't watched TV much this weekend.   Downloading: I downloaded a bunch of Stranger songs, but it's not as good as I thought they might be (going by the show I saw on friday). The Stranger songs I heard performed live by   Damn The Torpedoes  (their lead singer is the singer from Stranger) sounded way better than what Stranger actually recorded. Live, the songs rocked hard, but the Stranger originals are often a bit too cheesy for my taste (especially the keyboard parts).  Eating: It's been a rocky week for my diet. I haven't went nuts or anything, just had a couple naughty days. I will get back on track again starting tomorrow.   Feeling: A'ight.
