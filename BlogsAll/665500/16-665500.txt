What A Crappy Week!   So true, and mostly due to that damn rodent, who, by the way, is still unaccounted for. I checked the traps every day and he still hasn't set them off. There is only one way out and he has not gone out that way or it'd be quite obvious (I closed it off and duct-taped it very, very well). The only other way out would be if he had eaten a hole through one of the two far walls which are obstructed with my Mom's clothes, but I have not heard any chewing or gnawing sounds. My brother-in-law is supposed to come down tonight and we are going to do a "hard target search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse, and doghouse in that area". Or something like that. This "fugitive" rat will be caught tonight: dead or alive. My Mom has slept at a friends house for the last four nights and is wary of going into her own room or using her own bathroom now. Myself, I have had a very hard time sleeping all week and I've missed two days worth of work on account of our unwelcome houseguest. I went to work yesterday and yawned all afternoon long, I was so tired. I finally had a full night's sleep last night though, but I missed Game 2 of the NBA Finals in order to do so. I had laid down for a nap around 6:30 pm and started reading "The Silence Of The Lambs", which I didn't put down until I dozed off a few hours later. I didn't get up until 9:30 this morning. I really needed that "nap".
