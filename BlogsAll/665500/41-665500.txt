Lately, I've been...     Listening to : Lenny Bruce. I have his Carnegie Hall concert on CD and have been playing that in my room while playing Dr.Mario. This is a great show: brilliant, funny, and heavily improvised. Great stuff!   Reading : I keep meaning to start the Sherlock Holmes book, but it still hasn't happened. I haven't read anything for a couple of weeks now. I really should back to reading nightly.   Watching on TV : "Curb Your Enthusiasm". I love this show, but I especially enjoy the one they're re-running tonight (and all week), where everyone thinks Larry has an ass fetish ("I am not an ass man!"). I haven't watched TV much at all other than this show (they re-run 2 episodes a week on HBO), "Whose Line Is It Anyway?", "Insomniac with Dave Attell", "Everybody Loves Raymond", "The Simpsons", "Saturday Night Live", and CNN Headline News. I will occasionally watch something on TLC or Animal Planet, but for the most part, that's about the extent of my TV watching nowadays.   Downloading : I downloaded some more Lenny Bruce stuff today, I want to find some complete shows (Curran, Berkeley). I downloaded some Carlos Mencia shows the other day too. I am a comedy fanatic!   Eating : I am revamping my diet, adding Slim Fast to the mix. I am still eating less than ever before, I hope that counts for something, but I'm still not exercising (my back is just too bad).    Feeling : Anxious, like I'm at a turning point. There's a lot that I am in the process of changing at the moment.
