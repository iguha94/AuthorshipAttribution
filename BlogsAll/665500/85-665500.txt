Monday, Payday   I got paid today, not much, but I gots me a bottle of Jack Daniels and a 12 pack of Pepsi, so I'm doing a'ight. Don't know when I'll get into it though; tomorrow I'm supposed to go out with JP and Al to Boomers for their open mic night (to look for a drummer). We also may practice at JP's work for a while on acoustics in case we want to play a few songs at Boomers (I really don't). Thursday is my Birthday, but I'm supposed to practice with JP and Al over at Circle that night. Friday, I'll probably be going up to New Port Richey to buy envelopes and hit Pawn shops (and possibly to bring my niece or younger nephew down), and Saturday, my sister and two of her kids (my older nephew can't come, he'll be away playing in an All-Star basketball game in Orlando) are supposed to come down for my Birthday, but like I said, we may have one of them down a little earlier. Sunday is my auction night, so that pretty much leaves only Wednesday to drink some Jack and chill (I still have a full bottle of wine in the fridge too). I am off from 5pm Tuesday night until 11:30 am Monday morning. I took some time off to get stuff done around the house, but it looks now like I should have just taken the whole week off. We're supposed to have company down from Pennsylvania next week (a cousin and her family) or the week after and the house is an absolute shithole. My Mom is off all this week too (I didn't know that when I took the time off), but it's not likely that she'll get too much done on her own. Plus there's that whole War thing. I have a feeling it's not going to be a very relaxing week. I'm probably going to need some Jack Daniels before it's over.
