This weekend I've been...    Listening to: I have Miles Davis' "  Kind Of Blue " in the CD player still. I've also been listening to some of my old jams with friends in my cassette player.    Playing : If you've read it once, you've read it 1,000 times: Dr.Mario. Still.   Reading : I still haven't started a new book yet. This week I'll start the Sherlock Holmes book for sure.    Watching on TV : Stand-up comedy on HBO, mainly. I watched   David Cross'  "The Pride Is Back!" for about the 5th or 6th time and also Eddie Izzard's "Dressed To Kill" for about the 12th time. Both are absolutely brilliant. I tried watching some pre-season NFL football on Saturday night, but it was just too boring for me. I lasted a half an hour before I had to move on. I guess I lose some guy points there.    Downloading : I downloaded a bunch of   Eddie Izzard  stuff that I had deleted from my computer before (when Gateway told me I had to wipe my hard drive). I'm very glad to have that stuff back: Eddie rules. Also, I gave in to temptation and downloaded "  Goldmember ". It was awesome! I am still planning on seeing it in the theater though; this movie, like the other Austin Powers movies, is one that I could watch 100 times and not get tired of it. Mike Myers is phenomenal!    Eating : The diet is over. I didn't feel it was working, so now I'm playing it by ear until I devise a "cunning diet plan" ("Blackadder" reference there, did ya get it?).    Feeling : Anxious, very ready to get on with things. Progress is near, hopefully.
