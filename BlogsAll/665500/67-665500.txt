Lately, I've been...     Listening to : Nothing lately. When I've been my room, it's been to read or sleep.     Reading : I just finished Stephen King's "The Stand". Great book, maybe the best King book I've read thus far, but I was a bit disappointed by the last scene with Flagg. It really felt anticlimactic to me. I like what I've read here, but I would like to read the full, unedited version someday. It'd be be neat to see what all he left out.  I think I'm going to read his "Danse Macabre" next, unless I did out a Hendrix book or two tomorrow.     Watching on TV : Not much so far this week, just been reading and playing guitar a lot. Mom brought home the first Lord Of The Rings movie and I hope to watch it tomorrow when I'm off. I haven't seen either of them yet.     Downloading : I downloaded a bunch of Mike Nesmith songs (solo and with the Monkees), plus a bunch of Gilbert Gottfried appearances on the Howard Stern Show. Man, I wish we got Stern here.      Playing : Nothing but my guitar, unless playing with the cats counts.    Working : They cut my hours a bit from last week to this, and I left 1/2 hour early today (I got everything done early), but I may pick up a few extra hours on Friday.     Eating : Meatball sandwiches for dinner, all week so far.     Feeling : Anxious, but hopeful. Waiting and hoping for my tax refund to show up in my checking account. I really need the money! I'm also getting really anxious about my music again. Whenever I start playing more often, I get frustrated because I should be out there, playing in a band, because I am good enough to do that.
