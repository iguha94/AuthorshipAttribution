Monday Blues   I was about 40 minutes late for work today. First I overslept (the bed was soooo comfy), but then I just couldn't get out of the bathroom in time to catch the bus. After I got to work, I wound up spending a good part of the afternoon in the men's room there too. Nature called and boy, did I answer! I think that Mexican food is  still  kicking my ass! Although, I did have an upset stomach last week too... perhaps it's my medicine (almost over the flu, but still have ear discomfort, some congestion and wheezing, though not as bad as before). We were busy at work today, and besides my tardiness, two other people didn't show up at all (no calls either) so we were short-handed. Nobody really complained about me being late though, which was nice. I snagged a free lunch while there, unbeknownst to my boss. After I got home, I spent the rest of night downloading music, mainly Los Lobos and Randy California songs (I'd never heard Randy California before last night, only heard of him, but I liked what I have heard thus far), and playing with the kitties. I still haven't named them yet. My niece suggested calling the ornery one "Doctor Evil" and I kind of like "Doc" for him, the other one I started calling "Mini-Mew", but I don't think it's going to stick. "Socks" (for the black and white one) and "Smokey" (for the gray one) could stick, but the names are just too bland and common for my liking. Their previous owners called them "Zip" and "Tucker" but I don't like those names either. I might call the gray one "Toonces" since he kind of looks like "Toonces (The Cat Who Could Drive A Car)" from SNL. Maybe not. I don't know. Naming the cats is much harder than it should be! Well, anyway, that's pretty much how I spent my whole night tonight. I do have things that I needed to do, but I did nothing of any importance tonight. I'm off early tomorrow (so far), so I'll probably (possibly) get back on track then. Or not.
