Jam Night   No drummer again tonight, but I noticed an ad for a drummer on the bulletin board at the rehearsal studios when we were coming in. JP called and talked to the guy. We're going to get together with him on Saturday, from 5pm to 7pm. He said he's played for over 30 years, so he's probably a bit of a geezer. Hopefully he'll work out okay, but at the very least, we'll get some practice in with a drummer. We went through a bunch of songs tonight, not the whole list that JP wanted us to go through, but a lot of them. We played most of them a couple times each, to get them tighter and to fine-tune stuff. We're getting better all the time, but we all have areas that we need to improve on: I still have work to do in the solo department (and in the amplification/tone department), Al's bass is a bit clunky at times (he's playing with a pick), and JP needs to work on his guitar playing more. I talked to JP about his guitar the other day, and tonight he admitted that yeah, he did need to work on it. No one has said anything to Al though. I think I'm the only one who notices, but I hate to criticize him because he's graciously switched from guitar to bass because of me, so it'd be like adding insult to injury coming from me. I'm normally not hesitant to speak up though, in fact, I often find myself to be the only one doing so. Tonight I corrected two songs that they had been playing slightly wrong, JP argued at first about "You May Be Right" (they weren't playing the F# chord during the chorus), but later realized that it sounded right the way I told him, so all is well. Anyhoo...we'll see how it goes on Saturday. I won't have much time to work on my solos between now and then though. I'm a little worried that the drummer is going to keel over in sonic agony when I break out into the lead for "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", which I am currently mangling. We shall see...
