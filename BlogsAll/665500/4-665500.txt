In Praise Of ....Tommy Lee ?!?!?   In my last post I touched on "the dumbing down of America", and in this one I am going to praise the new Tommy Lee CD. Go figure. I happened to catch him playing his song "Hold Me Down" on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (a show I normally do not watch) and really hated it. Not so much the song, but Tommy himself, and his guitarist. Tommy's vocals were pretty rough, but that didn't bother me much. What  did  bother me was that, quite often, he would adopt a pseudo-British accent when he sang. Very strange. Very lame. Lamer yet, when Tommy played guitar and sang, he would smile at the camera/audience with a "look at me ladies, I'm shy and sexy" smile, which simply made me ill (guys with tattoos all over their bodies and huge nose rings just should not be behaving in that manner). When I saw him do it the first time (and he did it a lot), the word "poser" came immediately to mind; a word that I've rarely used since the late '80's/early 90's (the "hair band" years). His guitarist bothered me too, but not for his looks or his behaviour, but because his guitar playing sucked. He'd go off and do a Cobain-type solo (complete with Kurt-style over-the-top guitar effects) and it would leave a gap, sonically, in the song. It all seemed weird and out of place in the song anyway. Luckily, in the CD's mix, the guitar (and everything else) comes together in a cohesive manner and sounds just right. Sure, Tommy still seems to be singing with a British accent at times, but overall, his vocals are decent, the songs are catchy and the CD is well produced. I would recommend Tommy Lee's "Never A Dull Moment" CD to  most  people. By no means is it another "Electric Ladyland" or "Physical Graffiti", but it's a very enjoyable listen, and that's good enough. Enjoy!
