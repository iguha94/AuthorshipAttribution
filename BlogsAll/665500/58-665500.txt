Christmas Blues   The general concensus in my family (i.e. my Mom and my sister) is that Christmas is "for the kids", which I think is total bullshit. The adults get neglected in the gift receiving department, yet we're the ones doing all of the buying, all of the working for the money to buy the gifts...why should we be left out of the receiving end? Don't get me wrong, I'm not being greedy or anything, I enjoy buying things for my family too. I like trying to pick out things they'll like, maybe stuff they wouldn't normally buy for themselves, and I like seeing their smiles when they are pleasantly surprised by something I gave them. But why shouldn't that be reciprocated? I, for one, like the idea that someone would take the time to pick out a gift especially for me, based on my likes and dislikes. It means that someone knows me well enough to shop for me and it also means that someone cares enough to put themselves out for me. I don't think those sentiments are for children only, nor should they be, but in my family, it appears that's just the way it is and I hate it. The main problem, and one that no one will likely admit to, is procrastination. Everyone waits until the last minute to do the Christmas shopping, nothing is ever budgeted, so we usually end up short on money. This translates into: the kids will get theirs, the adults will have to do without. I'm guilty of procrastinating too, but I usually try to make the effort to get everyone  something . After all, how much enjoyment is there in watching children who have everything, who have way more than I ever had (some even more than I have now), opening even more gifts that they don't need or appreciate, and often, don't even want? I say "let the grown ups have some fun too".
