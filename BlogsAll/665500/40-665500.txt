"How I Spent My Day-Off" by Gary Thomas   I was off on Wednesday, as usual, but this Wednesday I actually got to do some fun stuff. I got up around 12:30 pm (actually slept fairly well for a change) and by 1:20, I was on my way to the movies with my friend Sue. We saw the new Austin Powers movie, "Goldmember"; it was my third viewing (I'd seen it downloaded from the internet), her first. We laughed our asses off! This is a hilarious movie and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh. After the movie, we stopped at Marbos, a Chinese Buffet that we both like. I chowed down on peel-and-eat shrimp, fried clams, meatballs, I ate a mussel, almost ate a piece of sushi (the waiter took it away with my plate before I could try it), ate my favorite noodles (they're really thin and have egg, mushrooms, shrimp, poirk, and other stuff in them), ate a little of a few other things too. As always, I had my bowl of tapioca pudding at the end. I was STUFFED. No joke! On the way home from Marbos we stopped at Salvation Army and I picked up five more books (3 books in a Star wars trilogy, a Dean Koontz book, and "Apollo 13"). Almost as soon as Sue dropped me off at home, my friend John came over and we rehearsed my music for a good hour. Man, some of it sounded pretty darn good, if I may say so myself. I'm really looking forward to the jam with him, his drummer, and his bassist/keyboardist. Now I just need to get a bunch of it recorded so they'll have some idea what I'm playing. I guess I know what I'll be doing in my spare time (or  should  be doing, anyway). After John left, I started playing around on the computer and downloaded a whole bunch of cool stuff. I wound up playing Age Of Empires II and lost track of time (like I always do when I play it!), and before I knew it, it was bedtime! I listened to Lenny Bruce's Originals Vol.2 CD while in bed. What a day!
