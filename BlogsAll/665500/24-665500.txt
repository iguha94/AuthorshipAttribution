This week I've been...     Listening to : I threw on a CD (disc 2) from Jimi Hendrix's   Experience Box set  and have played that a couple of times in the last few days. That's about all I've realy listened to the last few days.    Playing : "Dr.Mario"...still.   Reading : I had been reading that Tim Allen book, but now I'm done and will be starting a new one. I'm really leaning towards the Sherlock Holmes book I picked up at Goodwill a week or so ago which contains "A Study In Scarlett" and The Hound Of The Baskervilles".   Watching on TV : I've barely watched TV on all weekend. Tonight, I had the picture on, but the sound off.    Downloading : My local newspaper did a story on newer bands that have an older feel to them, so I downloaded a ton of stuff from these bands to check them out (the beauty of filesharing). I really liked what I heard from   The White Stripes  a lot and will be buying all three of their CDs eventually. Just a guy on guitar and a girl on drums, but they have a big sound. Great stuff! Black Rebel Motorcycle Club was also really, really good too. From their name, I was excpecting something really hard and heavy metal, but it wasn't at all, in fact, some of their stuff was very acoustic and even Doors-y. The Vines were decent, as was Mars Volta. The Hives were ok, I liked some of their stuff. And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead was alright too, but their ridiculously long name won't help their popularity much. It was nice to hear some new music, it was even nicer finding some that doesn't suck, and it's nice to know that, somwhere out there, Rock & Roll is still alive and kicking.    Eating : Don't ask. Terrible week for me dietwise. I'm still doing better than I was a year ago, but not as well as I was doing a month ago.   Feeling : Very uneasy about my future. Everything is a mess.
