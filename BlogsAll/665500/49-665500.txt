Lately, I've been...     Listening to : Nothing much lately. I've had Wilco on in my room, listened to some Dio on the PC, but haven't really just kicked back and  listened  to anything for awhile.   Reading : About 2 months ago I started a Dean Koontz book, but between my sleep problems and the book not holding my interest, I put it down and haven't read anything since. Last night I picked up my Sherlock Holmes book "A Study In Scarlet", the first Holmes novel by Sir Athur Conan Doyle. Great stuff, as always.    Watching on TV : I've been watching "Home Improvement", "Everybody Loves Raymond" (2 episodes), and then "Seinfeld" during the week, with re-runs of  "Saturday Night Live" thrown in for good measure. I've also been watching "The Sopranos" and "Curb Your Enthusiasm" every Sunday and then watching them again, many times over, throughout the week. Half the time, I'm actually on the computer while all of these shows are on and only half watching them.    Downloading : I haven't downloaded anything for awhile; nothing new I'm interested in at this time.    Playing : I've been playing "Boggle" on the PC still, that's it really.   Eating : Too much. I have discovered turkey burgers and am loving them!   Feeling : In a MAJOR rut. All I do anymore is work (more at home than away), eat, goof off on the PC and watch TV. That's my life.
