Wiped Out   For the second night in a row, I barely slept. Unlike the numerous other times I've made it through the day without having slept, it caught up with me today... with a vengeance.  I just haven't been able to sleep at night, due mostly to my back problems, and when I do sleep, it's usually not "a good night's sleep". I toss and turn all night long, and before I know it, the alarm is ringing. Today I had to leave work early because I was just so wiped out. I had no energy, I had an upset stomach (I don't eat before I go to work, which probably didn't help me either), the heat of the kitchen was bothering me more than usual, and I was just flat-out tired, yawning like mad. To make matters worse, when I got home, I was dropping things, knocking things over, and then I (nearly) shit myself. I'd heard before how long distance runners lose bowel control because they get exausted, fatigued, and that is what actually happened to me today. Unbelievable. I have probelms sleeping almost everyday, some days are better than others, but I think the level of sleeplessness that I've been encountering lately is an indication that something is not quite right. I don't know if it's the mattress, if it's my diet, if it's stress or anxiety (my mind is usually reluctant to shut down at bedtime), or what, but something is wrong. I've tried sleeping pills, but they didn't work for me. I gotta do something and soon; I can't take a whole lot more days like today.
