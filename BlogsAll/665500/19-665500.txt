All Alone In A Crowded Room   Tonight, I went to a party and was miserable. Almost as soon as I arrived, I was ready to call it a night. It was, by any standard, a great party. They had a nice buffet, free beer and sodas, and my friend's band played live for everyone. They had a professional DJ there as well, and a dance floor to dance on. It should've been a great night, and I'd be willing to bet, that for almost everyone else there, it was. But for me, the party was akin to a slow, agonizing death. I looked around the room tonight and I saw other folks having fun and enjoying themselves; drinking, dancing, laughing, etc... and I felt so distant from them all, removed, completely detached from everyone else. It was if I was on the outside looking in, yet again.   I don't know what it is with me, but I rarely enjoy parties. I know that I'm extremely self-concious, and being in a crowded room only amplifies that feeling, but that wasn't the problem tonight. I don't think it's that I'm anti-social either. I know I may seem awkward and shy at first, but once you get to know me, you'll find that I'm a real pain in the ass; a real  fun  pain in the ass. Perhaps it's just that I'm not comfortable in that kind of setting; I prefer a more casual, more intimate setting. I'd much rather talk and joke with friends than dance with them, I'd much rather wear a T-shirt and shorts than a dress shirt and slacks, and I'd much rather play in a band than watch one. In other words: I'd rather have been doing something else, somewhere else, than doing what I was, then.   So that was my night, once again, all alone in a crowded room.
