Thursday   I didn't go to bed around 4am like I thought, in fact, I didn't make it there until around 5:30am. I wound up watching the last 3 episodes of "Police Squad!" with my niece again (she can't get enough of that show or of Leslie Nielson). I woke up around 2pm (my niece was already up watching "Police Squad!" again) and, instead of going out for the day as I had planned, we decided to stay in. I ordered from Bradford Pub and we chowed down (me on Nachos, she on Steak-N-Cheese hoagie). Afterwards, we watched a little of the Marx Brother's movie "Horse Feathers" (just a little, my niece didn't get a lot of the jokes) and then "The Pink Panther Strikes Again". Later, I went to my room (by myself) and played "Dr.Mario" awhile. My niece came in after a bit and I worked with her on guitar some more. I taught her part of AC/DC's "Back In Black", Led Zeppelin's "Dazed And Confused" and "Communication Breakdown", Muddy Water's "Mannish Boy", Cream's "Sunshine Of Your Love", and Green Day's  "When I Come Around". She has trouble fingering the notes and moving from position to position, but she catches on fairly quickly. Later we went out and played catch with my mini-football (I've about given up on Frisbee with her!). It felt awesome outside tonight! Overcast and windy...sweet! After that, we came in and watched most of "Young Frankenstein", but we both got bored with it. I put on some of my old tapes from the late '80's /early '90's instead, and we watched a little "Beavis & Butthead" and some old "Saturday Night Live's". Pretty mellow day today. My niece has already gone to bed, I'll be going to mine shortly. Tomorrow: the museum!
