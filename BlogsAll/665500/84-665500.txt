Mini-Vacation Begins ... Now!   Yay!!!! I'm on vacation!!! Yay!!!! Yay!!!! Yay for me!!!! I worked all day today then I came home and worked all night... I am ready for that vacation! I have 5 full days off now, but they are jam-packed (as I noted yesterday).   I didn't go out tonight as planned; Al couldn't make it and I don't think JP really wanted to go very much, which worked out well for me as I wanted to list some auctions tonight (and did). JP said he may back out of Thursday's jam too (no drummer, and Al's not sure if he can make it). I suggested playing here, just me and him, but it sounded like he didn't want to play at all. He's too busy outside of the band. I don't know how he ever expects to do much with the band if he can't make time to practice  at least  once a week. I'm pushing for twice a week, myself. If it were up to me, we'd be playing four nights a week, every week. You don't get tight playing two hours a week together.   I am still working on getting my stuff together musically (equipmentwise and songwise), and I think I am going to go my own way as soon as I can. I might work with him and do my own thing on the side too...whatever works. I would love to quit Wendys and make a living just playing music and selling stuff online. I hate having a boss (boss es , actually), I hate having to get up early (ok, early  for me ) to go to a job that bores me, I hate having to wear a stupid uniform, I hate having to shave everyday (ok, twice a week), and I hate dealing with stupid people on a daily basis.  Self-employment is the only way to go.
