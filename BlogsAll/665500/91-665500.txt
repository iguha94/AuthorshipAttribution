What's Up   I finally got to jam! Yay!! Me, John and Al got together at Circle Studios and played for about 2 hours. We started off with one of John's songs, "Free Spirit", but pretty much the rest of the time was spent on my stuff. John started coming up with lyrics for two of my songs (an uptempo song in B and my mellow reggae-ish song in A) and I added a solo section to "Free Spirit" that may or may not remain (Al said it sounded like Santana). We also jammed on my funky D jam (D7-G9-C9). I played ok, but not as good as I can. Most of the problem was the PA, but the bass (Al played bass on my stuff) was a little too overbearing, and I could hardly hear the amp I was playing from (a Marshall 1/2 stack). We really needed drums to get everything flowing better. It was awesome playing again. The jam situation is me in my element, I love it! We're supposed to jam again next week...can't wait!  Been buying a lot on eBay lately....I had some real steals this week. I won a Jack Bruce CD, "Monkjack", which is out of print, for just $5.75 (which includes shipping). Oh, I forgot to mention that it is still sealed  and  it's a Japanese pressing! What a deal! I also won a brand new book, "Second City" (the history of the Second City comedy troupe), which comes with 2 CDs of Second City sketches (featuring a ton of SNL folks) for just $9.29 (which includes shipping)! Tonight, I won a new, unopened box of Fender guitar strings (12 packs) for just $34 (includes shipping). That's less than $3 a pack! Sweet! eBay is freakin'  addictive !
