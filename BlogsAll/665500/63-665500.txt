Still Crappy, Only A Little Less So   Rough week thus far! I went to work on Monday and survived, but I only lasted an hour and a half on Tuesday. I was sweating profusely almost as soon as I left my house. I got so hot at work though, it felt like I was overheating. My stomach was queasy too, my nerves shaky, and I was coughing up phlegm; not exactly the guy you'd want serving you in a restaurant anyway. They wanted me to stay until 3, but I had to go then, at 1. I needed some cool air more than anything. It was better at home, but I've found that our A/C is no longer working for some reason. I'm still pretty stuffy and congested and my ears are still popping, but I'm better than I was a few days ago. I'm just hoping it's all done with by this weekend. I'm supposed to go up to my sister's a for my nephew's basketball game (the 1st of the season) and then we're going to do stuff with my niece, including bringing her here to stay overnight. There's supposed to be a meteor shower at 4am on Saturday morning and I'd like to take her outside to see it if it's possible (it may rain here) and if I can get her ass up to see it. If I'm still feeling shitty, all those plans may change. I hope not though, I really enjoy the time I get to spend with the kids, and it's good for me physically too; they're usually good for a few hours of outdoor excecise for me!
