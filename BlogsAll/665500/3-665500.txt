Memorial Day 2002   Today was Memorial Day, the day America "pays tribute" to the people who have lost their lives supporting the higher causes of Freedom and Democracy and the American Way. And how did we, as Americans (myself included), "pay tribute" to those people? We barbecued, we went to the movies, many of us slept in all day and/or watched TV all day, we went to the beach; for the most part, business as usual. We really should've had nationwide celebrations and tributes to those people whose blood was spilled and lives lost, something that would've equated the importance of their sacrifices to our daily lives; instead we got a few war movies on cable. We are, for the most part, spoiled people and spoiled people normally don't think about what it takes to keep our living standards as high as they are. If so many courageous men (and some women) hadn't died on the battlefields throughout the years, would our lives be the same today? Instead of dancing to fresh rap grooves on Total Request Live, perhaps we'd be goosestepping to the beat of  Deutschland Uber Alles  on Der Fuhrer's Requests Live (oddly enough, still hosted by Carson Daly). Perhaps, instead of watching "Friends" on Thursday nights, we'd be tuning in to a show called "Comrades". At the very least, we should all take a few moments on this day to remember what Memorial Day is  really  about and to say a quiet "thank you" to those who perished.   What I did today: Slept in. Worked on the PC for a few hours. Watched a Saturday Night Live marathon on TV. Played my guitar. Took a nap. Downloaded Blondie songs and Wilco's new CD from Limewire. Watched more TV. Took a few moments to remember the folks who died throughout the years, enabling me to do all of these things today.   Peace.  Gary
