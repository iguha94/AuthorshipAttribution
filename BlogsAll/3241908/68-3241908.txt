         Dan at   Working It Out  does a good quick summary of the culture of death and satan's ultimate end game. Considering the "me, me, me" attitude that leads to this culture, its no surprise that it is the exact opposite of sacrificial love. The ultimate example of that all-powerful, all-encompassing love is Jesus who fasted and prayed ... and told us to imitate Him. Most thought provoking of all is the answer to all this.  Our culture may have passed the point of no return. Is there no hope? There is always hope. But those of faith will need to repent, fast, and pray like never before. We live in perilous and exciting times. Are we up for the challenge?  There's a question that makes me stop and think. I despise the culture of death and pray for its victims. But is that enough? Am I up to the challenge of showing self sacrifice for them?  I have opportunities every day to hop out of bed when the alarm rings, pass up that snack between meals, cheerfully let someone barge in front of me ... to offer up obedience and sacrifice in so many ways during the day. Do I take them? Sometimes yes, sometimes I just don't feel like it. That's not good enough. These are not big things but it is in the little things of every day that we learn how to die to self.  It is in times like these that God sends us great saints. Where will they come from if we do not let Him use us as He will?
