         Today's Mass reading is of Abraham bargaining with God for the lives of the people in Sodom and Gomorrah. In this case God promised the if 10 good men are found, He will spare thousands. As "In Conversation with God" points out, this is a glimpse of the solidarity of good. God sees our struggles to be faithful and it gives Him joy and delight.   God sets great store by those who struggle for sanctity.  God's delight is in the saints;  it is for their sake that He pours our his mercy and his forgiveness on others who may have done nothing themselves to merit it. It is a wonderful but at the same time a real mystery, that God so delights in those who journey towards sanctity.  Just as God allowed Abraham to bargain for those good men, He will listen to us when we ask Him for favors for those we love.   For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.  Ten just men would have been enough! People who are really holy more than make up for all the crimes, the abuse, envy, lack of loyalty, betrayal, injustice, selfishness ... of all the inhabitants of a great city. If we are united with the redeeming sacrifice of Jesus Christ, god will look with special compassion on our relatives, friends, acquaintances ... who have perhaps strayed from the path out ignorance, or error, or weakness ... or because they did not receive the graces that we have received. ... "Look, Lord" - we will say to him - "this person is better than he seems. He has good intentions. Help him!" And Jesus, who nevertheless knows the real situation, will move that person with his grace out of regard for our friendship with him ... Those who strive to be united to Christ truly sustain the world.
