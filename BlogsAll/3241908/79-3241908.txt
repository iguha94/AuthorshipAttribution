         I remember really surprising a good friend when I said that Jesus is a jokester with a really great sense of humor. Personal experience aside, its pretty easy to find proof of it in the Gospels where Jesus constantly uses humor to make points. And, as He told us over and over, we only can know the Father through the Son, so God must have the best jokes ever. Of course, if you don't know someone well there is a good chance of greatly offending fellow Christians with religious humor as Steve Tompkins aptly points  out in   Get them rolling in the aisles .  A perfect example is The Life of Brian. Few films can have been more picketed, thanks to its "blasphemous mockery of Christ". But the butt of the religious jokes are really Christ's painfully true-to-life followers, divided over whether to adore his unwanted gourd or his lost sandal. They manufacture miracles ("He's gone! He's been taken up!" "Oh no, there he is. Over there"), and are too busy being religious to hear his criticisms. Naturally, it was the ones at whom it was directed who failed to see the message of the satire.  ...And Jesus himself made fun of those whose zeal for the letter of the law blinded them to what it was actually about: they strained their drink to ensure they didn't break their fast by inadvertently swallowing a gnat, and overlooked the camel bobbing around in the cup. Probably loses something in translation, but I bet it was funny.  Via   connexions .
