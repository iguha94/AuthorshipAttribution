          VAN HELSING   Werewolves, vampires, and Frankenstein ... oh my! Van Helsing is like the Vatican's 007 complete with an underground cavern where the friar equivalent of "Q" invents monster killing equipment. They thrown in practically every type of monster that ever has been in a movie except zombies. Why no zombies? Perhaps because they don't have that "Transylvanian" story behind them. I'd say more but there's no point. Its a summer spectacular which was just about what I thought it would be from the previews: a mishmash of monsters and over-the-top special effects with way too little plot. Sadly, even the obligatory one liners weren't that good. And I don't understand why Kate Beckinsall was dressed like a dominatrix (probably the guys at the movie understood that just fine). It wasn't a complete loss. Hugh Jackman always is a treat although he spent most of the movie with a turtle neck sweater on. Staying home with one or both of the X-Men movies is a much better way to get a dose of him than going to this.  Of course, the whole point of going to the movie was that it was Rose's birthday party. On that score it was a HUGE success. Everyone loved the movie although it does take a car full of good Catholic girls to puzzle half way home about a plot point involving the Archangel Gabriel, which cracked me up. Even more hilarious was that Tom said his car full of girls was doing the exact same thing. I love it! I was reminded that I am lucky that Rose has good friends who are such great kids. Listening to the laughing and hilarity before and after made the whole movie worthwhile.
