         We just got back from Austin where a Davis family mini-reunion was going on. We all met in Austin and then trekked out to Round Top in the middle of the countryside for their annual parade. My kids were pretty sure we'd finally reached the official Middle of Nowhere but I loved it. Round Top is set in the middle of rolling hills and lots of trees. Not exactly the picture of Texas that we have been left with by the movies, its on the edge of the hill country.  The parade has grown from the days when the Davis family had a farm in nearby Giddings but in essence it was still the same sweet, country parade we expected. Various patriotic speeches were made and the cannon was set off to signal the start. Floats with politicians, veterans and pretty girls went by; groups rode horses, miniature horses pulled buggies, boys even rode longhorn steers ... it was the kind of event that you think doesn't happen any more except it still happens all over the country, I'd venture to say.  I think that a lot of people in the media and Hollywood would have been surprised at how the speeches were used to emphatically approve of God and religion being mixed in with politics and daily life. Certainly, they would have been surprised at the wholehearted approval with which such sentiments were met. This is the heart of America that is not understood by a lot of the people who run the country ... with love of God and family values at the center of it.  I have had certain sophisticated people tell me that my values are simplistic and most of America doesn't think like that any more. They need to spend a little time someplace like Round Top. It certainly would open their eyes ... and wouldn't take more than the time to watch a parade.
