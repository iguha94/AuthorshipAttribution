         Rod Dreher's  Dallas Morning News  editorial yesterday,   Q. What's wrong with this picture? , highlighted the fact that good news from Iraq isn't worth covering to most media organizations. Thus we are left with the general idea that nothing good is happening at all which is totally untrue.  Following up over at   The Corner on National Review Online , Dreher reported that among the many responses to his editorial was a correspondent who sent   Gallup Poll results  released yesterday. They show that, despite the recent scandals, the military is still the top rated institution with a 75% confidence rating. How did the media fare? Not nearly so well with a 30% rating which is down 5% from the year before. Television news is   at its lowest rate since 1993.     Confidence in television news, at 30%, is down five points compared with last year, and is the lowest recorded in Gallup's trends for this item dating back to 1993. The previous low for television news was 33% in April 1995. Newspapers also dropped slightly over the past year -- from 33% to 30% -- almost tying the all-time low for this institution, 29%, previously recorded in March 1994.   Its nice to see that we're not as stupid as the media seems to think we are. The next question is, "Will the media do anything about their falling numbers?" They may give it a shot but probably not because they don't understand the average American which is their problem in the first place. If they worried about simply reporting the news rather than influencing it they would be better off ... and so would we.
