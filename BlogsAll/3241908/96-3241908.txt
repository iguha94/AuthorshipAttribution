         Oswald Sobrino at Catholic Analysis looks at the analysis of recent employment figures and points out what a   spoiled nation  we are. Be sure to read the whole thing because he covers much more than just statistical figures.  So when news comes in that, according to  one  of the Labor Department's statistical measures on employment, "only" 32,000 jobs were created, the media reaction is that the employment situation is "dismal." That reaction is a sign of a spoiled and weak culture that lives in a fantasy world. What nation in the world would not trade their economy for ours? How many emigrate from the United States to settle in other countries?  What makes the "spoiled nation" syndrome even more absurd is that another official statistical measure of job growth shows that jobs grew in July by  629,000.    I welcome Sobrino's common sense especially because these doomsday pronouncements always seem to come just when all the business people I know are giving each other reports of "We're doing better bit by bit if only the government won't make one of their  statements ." You'd be surprised how many people  check in  with each other on business progress; even some executives from large companies will discuss this with us in our little three-person company. Now if we could just get the  talking heads  to use some of the same common sense we'd be ok.
