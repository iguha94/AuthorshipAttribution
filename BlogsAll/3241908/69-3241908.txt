         There is something so special about the bond between a father and daughter. Not only is it important on a personal level but how will tomorrow's women know what a good man is unless they spend time with one? Like any hard-working father, Tom has to make a significant effort to squeeze in the time so that he really knows the girls. For some time now, he has been driving Hannah to school every morning just to get some of that one-on-one time. When he runs errands on the weekends, he makes sure Rose is invited as she just loves riding in the car and that becomes "their" time.  Tom and Hannah are in San Francisco right now for a special father-daughter celebration of her 16th birthday. We had a lot of AAdvantage miles so she got to pick anywhere in the continental U.S. Wise girl, she chose San Francisco.  They have been scouring the DK Eyewitness book for the perfect activities ... our St. Francine (aka Hannah) is hoping to see sea lions on Fisherman's Wharf, as a long time lover of all things Asian she wants to scour Chinatown's alleys for the really authentic shops, Tom has planned a drive to Bodega Bay and along High 1, reservations have been made to tour Alcatraz.  It touches my heart to think of the special memories they are making, memories that I hope last a lifetime ... which is the  real  perfect activity of this trip.
