         Sheryl Patterson has earned my admiration for sending a very honest and personal response to a pro-abortion editorial in the  Dallas Morning News . It must have taken sheer courage and determination to write this but she puts it all out there for us to see.      The worst decision I ever made    Re: "Reasons for Abortion â€“ Don't think yours is better than others'," by Barbara Ehrenreich, Saturday Viewpoints.  When I read Ms. Ehrenreich's column on the responsibility women have to speak up about the abortions they have had, I concurred 100 percent. For far too long I have been silent, and I wish to have my name added to the growing throng of women electing to terminate their pregnancies. I can state unequivocally that having an abortion was the worst decision I have ever made and I would do anything (short of taking another life) to undo it.  I did not have an abortion because my health was endangered, or because I was raped or because I was devastated to learn my child would have brown eyes instead of blue. I had an abortion because I was "not ready to be a parent." Funny that I don't think the fetus was ready to be aborted either. Perhaps the silent 70 percent of women, whom Ms. Ehrenreich laments, are those who have had abortions and regretted it.  As for rescinding my reproductive rights? Rescind away, baby.
