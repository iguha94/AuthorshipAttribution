         I finally have gotten the chance to read the Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial,   Catholics must make a choice , that has been mentioned around St. Blog's Parish. Talk about laying it on the line. That editorial was succinct and pithy, lauding the few bishops who have spoken up to defend Communion from people whose public actions don't support their talk of "personal faith." If its even that obvious to this secular newspaper then how far in the sand do some of these politicians and bishops have their heads buried? Or, perhaps more to the point, who do they think they're fooling?   Now a few brave bishops have wearied of these Pontius Pilate imitations remember, he voted for Jesus before he voted against him, and personally, he still didn't see anything wrong with the poor guy as he sent him up the hill to be crucified. These bishops are demanding that Catholics make a grown-up choice: Is Catholicism your faith or just your label? It's a fair question and, yes, indeed, it applies to every Catholic, not just the politicians...   Politicians, rationalize as you will. But if you're not voting according to your personal beliefs, you're subordinating your own wisdom to the demands of people with whom you disagree. Think about how little sense that makes, and how little respect that deserves.  Catholic voters, vote as you wish. No bishop will be looking over your shoulder. But if your political beliefs lead you to reject the religious or moral teachings of the church, go in peace.  In fact, what these bishops are saying is: You're already gone.
