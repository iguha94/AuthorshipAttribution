         Yikes! It is one thing for my mother to think that anyone who has religious faith is an "anti-modernist" or directly opposed to "science, reason and logic." It is another to read this quote from a former U.S. Labor Secretary who I would hope would be a little more open minded about such things.  Terrorism is a tactic, not a belief," he writes. The true battle will be between modern civilization and anti-modernists; between those who believe in the primacy of the individual and those who believe that human beings owe their allegiance and identity to a higher authority; between those who give priority to life in this world and those who believe that human life is mere preparation for an existence beyond life; between those who believe in science, reason, and logic and those who believe that truth is revealed through Scripture and religious dogma. Terrorism will disrupt and destroy lives. But terrorism itself is not the greatest danger we face.  Reich's remarks appeared in   The American Prospect . Commentary on the article appears in such diverse publications as   Christianity Today  and   National Review Online . Both come to the same conclusion. Reich's commentary is tantamount to declaring a war on the religious. I understand not liking how someone else's point of view but this is ridiculous. Ramesh Ponnaru's reaction is the best, nay the only one, for either a person of faith or an American.   I will not reciprocate the sentiment. Reich is not my enemy, although I certainly want most of what he stands for politically not to prevail. I don't think we have to have the battle he forecasts. I hope we don't. In fact, I pray we don't.  Via guest blogger Elliot Bougis at   Catholic and Enjoying It .
