         Mark Shea gets a more public forum than usual in today's  Dallas Morning News editorial,    Don't use Reagan's passing to push a ghastly program  (free registration required). He's saying what many in St. Blog's have been pointing out since Nancy Reagan started talking about stem cells this week. Adult stem cells or those from the umbilical cord are just as viable as those from embryos and harm no one in the "harvesting."  Stem cells have other sources besides artificially created children. For instance, they can be harvested from umbilical cord blood without taking innocent life. Those who push for stem cells that involve the taking of innocent human life do so not because of some sort of medical necessity but because there is gold in them thar hills to be had from the creation of an immense, wealth-generating industry dedicated to the manufacture and destruction of innocent human life. It is ironic that those most critical of Mr. Reagan and his "Decade of Greed" are those most staunchly in favor of the creation of a system that is entirely (and needlessly) about the exploitation of innocent human life for the sake of Mammon.   As Shea says, he already can "feel the love" as hostile responses started coming in. Read the editorial and then take a look at the articulate and elegantly put "love" on his site at   Catholic and Enjoying It . I can't believe I picked today to skip the editorial section. Thank goodness   The Curt Jester  was paying attention.
