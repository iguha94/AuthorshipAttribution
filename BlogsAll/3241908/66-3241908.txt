           THE AMAZING RACE  - WEEK FOUR There wasn't much of note in "The Amazing Race" last week except that Mirna got increasingly unpleasant and pretty much earned the "drive-by expletive" that got shouted at her. This week Mirna continued to show the mean streak that surfaced last week and we actually were rooting for them to be eliminated. How the race reveals character as time goes by, eh?  The real character revealing moment was when teams were faced with  two pounds  of caviar that had to be eaten by one of them before they could go on to the next step. Chip earned everyone's admiration by shoveling it in and leaving. When Christie cratered, gagging, and couldn't take another bite, Colin was nice at first but then frustration made him really impatient and mean. On the other hand, Brandon was consistently nice and caring when Nicole was lying on the floor because it made her so sick ... even though other teams were catching up and passing them. The same faith that made him pass up the vodka challenge really showed as he took care of Nicole without a trace of impatience.  This group seems to have a preponderance of good people in the teams ... Chip and Kim, the bowling moms, Brandon and Nicole. There still are folks with plenty to dislike. My first choice for elimination ... Mirna. Too bad about Charla but she's not stopping Mirna whenever she chooses the worst way to act.
