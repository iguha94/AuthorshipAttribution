          Heart, Mind & Strength  has some great thoughts from   Rachel Watkins  about God's endless creativity in reaching out to us and Satan's limits in doing the same. I hadn't thought about that before ... praise the Lord for Satan's limits!   I was thinking about that song as I was contemplating the myriad of ways God seeks to draw us back to ourselves.  He reaches out through the Church, friends, family, Scripture, saints and, yes, cheesy songs.  God has a limitless amount of mercy and an infinite arsenal of tools ready at his hand to draw us home to Him.  ... I've always believed that Satan cannot create, that is reserved for God alone.  God is the only Creator.  So, is Satan limited in how he can attack??  If so, it makes the spin on sin different for me.  It doesn't make me any less a sinner but it is a cause for praise to God that as I have gotten older certain tools used by Satan no longer have any appeal ...   Now, that isn't to say that there are 'new to me' sins that come with maturity but I am spending some time in grateful praise and thanksgiving that I have outgrown a good number of Satan's weapons.  And if Satan has a limited number of weapons to use against me, I just have to stay alive long enough to have all of them be rendered useless and I can die a saint!  Via   blogs4God .
