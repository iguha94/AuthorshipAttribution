           THE AMAZING RACE  - WEEK TWO I wasn't going to blog about this every week but "lower case julie" (lcj) and I carried on team evaluation in the comments box from last week's Amazing Race post so ...  Never was a more unpleasant couple eliminated than Alison and Donny. Just when you thought one person couldn't possibly be meaner to another, the other person would pop back with something even worse. If they get nothing else from this experience, I certainly hope they  never  get back together.  The girls and I still like Charla and Mirna's team best. lcj mentioned that she dislikes seeing Charla use her "little person" stature to get ahead. Usually I'd agree but in this case I just see it as evening the odds since Charla can't run very fast, etc. Mostly I like her attitude. When Mirna was second guessing herself over choosing the tango instead of walking eight dogs (yes, that's the kind of show it is) because of possible lost time, Charla just said, "Who knows what would have happened?" and let any bad choices blow away. No blame, just moving forward ... I liked that.  The real fascination is watching the combination of outrageous game show and soap opera. The stresses of the game bring out really interesting character strengths and flaws. The group dynamics are addictive. Even Tom stopped working on his laptop to watch and laugh when a twin herded a cow into a corner only to have Chip pluck off it's bandanna ... you only could appreciate that moment fully if you had seen the bad blood between them after the taxi stand-off earlier.
