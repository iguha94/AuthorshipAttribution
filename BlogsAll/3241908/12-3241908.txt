         Barbara Nicolosi (Church of the Masses) is having a wonderful time in Spain. Read about it in   Ah Valencia . Included is this hilarious, yet telling, exchange.  I met my first European aristocrat (EA), and the experience went a long way towards helping me understand why my ancestors would have fled everything they knew and owned to come to America. This fellow was a filmmaker from a country which shall go unnamed, and he had barely sat down at the table before he started insulting America, Hollywood, Americans in general and me in particular. The exchanges between courses went something like this…  EA: So, you have sixty writers who teach for your Act One? BN: Yes. EA: (sniff) I am amazed that there are sixty writers in Hollywood who have something to teach. EA: So what are the movies that some of your Act One instructors have worked on?  I named five or six films like X-Men, X2, Hoosiers, Rudy, What Women Want, Where the Heart Is, Remember the Titans, Batman Forever, Return to Me. None of which were known to the EA. Finally, I mentioned Braveheart…  EA: Ah, at last a film of some note.  So, - okay, a little wickedly – I asked him to name the movies had made. He noted that he had collaborated on one project with Maia Morgenstern who plays Mary in TPOTC. He asked if I had seen that project.  BN: No, I haven't seen that. EA: (looking away with disgust) Americans! BN: (with growing annoyance) When you didn't know the films I mentioned, I did not say, “Europeans!” like you were ignorant. EA: Because that I have not seen those Hollywood films is a reason for pride.
