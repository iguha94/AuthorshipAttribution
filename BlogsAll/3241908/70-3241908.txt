           Catholic Analysis  reports on a fascinating new brochure by the Catholic Medical Association entitled   Homosexuality and Hope . It asserts that homosexuality is NOT genetically based, despite society's best efforts to convince us of that fact. Usually environmental factors contribute to traits that society has labeled as homosexual. In today's environment that person then is virtually railroaded into same-sex attraction when what actually may be needed is therapy to help with the base problems. It is important to note that this brochure is a regular medical report based on case studies that are referenced, not a mere ideological statement. Once more, what "everyone knows" turns out not to be true at all.  Early identification (Hadden 1967[53]) and proper professional intervention, if supported by parents, can often overcome the gender identity disorder. (Rekers 1974[54]; Newman 1976) Unfortunately, many parents who report these concerns to their pediatricians are told not to worry about them. In some cases the symptoms and parental concerns may appear to lessen when the child enters the second or third grade, but unless adequately dealt with, the symptoms may reappear at puberty as intense, same-sex attraction. This attraction appears to be the result of a failure to identify positively with one's own sex.  It is important that those involved in child care and education become aware of the signs of gender identity disorder and chronic juvenile unmasculinity and have access the resources available to find appropriate help for these children. (Bradley 1998; Brown 1963[55]; Acosta 1975[56]) Once convinced that same-sex attraction is not a genetically determined disorder, one is able to hope for prevention and a therapeutic model to greatly mitigate, if not eliminate, same-sex attractions.
