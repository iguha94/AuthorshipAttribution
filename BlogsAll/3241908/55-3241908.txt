         Andrew at Shrine of the Holy Whapping demystifies Mary for a Protestant friend in    Mary, Luther, and Paul: Offering the Hail Mary to Protestants . This is a concise, beautifully written letter that encapsulates all the reasons Mary has been honored through the ages. I have never seen it put better or more understandably in such a short and readable piece.  It is therefore impossible to praise Mary without praising Christ more. If we honor Mary as the Mother of God, it praises Christ as God, who choose Mary to be the mother of His flesh. If we honor Mary as the Mother of Mercy, we honor Christ as Mercy Itself, to Whom Mary gave birth. If we honor Mary as Font of Grace, we honor Christ as Grace incarnate. When we honor her as our mother, we affirm that we, by the grace of God, have been made the Body of Christ. In other words, honoring Mary is a powerful way of honoring Christ, and can be nothing more.  And for this reason, honoring Mary is not specific to Catholics or to Catholic beliefs, and should not be. Anyone who can affirm St. Paul, anyone who can recognize the value of God’s work in the soul, anyone who worships God alone, can honor Mary as Christ honored Mary and love Mary as Christ loved Mary. In fact, even Martin Luther, who led a markedly tormented life up to its very end, found an unending source of consolation in Mary. One of his criticisms of the Catholic Church, which he included in a letter he wrote to a German prince long after the Reformation, was that Catholics covered up statues of Mary during Lent, depriving him of a reminder of his “heavenly mother.”
