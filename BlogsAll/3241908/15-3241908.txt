         Yesterday I read about Our Lady of Fatima saying that we should do constant penance in atonement for our sins, the sins or others and conversion of souls. A worthy cause indeed but I instantly had visions of constant fasting and denying myself everything I enjoy. Suddenly my future looks very bleak! This reading from  In Conversation With God  reminds us that we are offered boundless opportunities for penance in ordinary living. When I am itching to hit the snooze button, forcing myself to get up when the alarm sounds becomes a moment of supreme sacrifice, a "heroic minute." Now that is something I can offer to God every day.    The virtue of penance has to be present, to some degree, in all the everyday actions of life: in fulfilling exactly the timetable you have fixed for yourself, even thought your body resists. Penance is getting up on time and also not leaving for later, without any real reason, that particular job that you find harder or most difficult to begin and finish.  Penance is knowing how to reconcile your duties to God, to others and to yourself, by making demands on yourself so that you find enough time for each of your tasks. You are practicing penance when you lovingly keep to your schedule of prayer, despite feeling worn out, listless or cold...  Penance consists in putting up good-humoredly with the thousand and one little pinpricks of every day; in not abandoning your task, although you have momentarily lost the enthusiasm with which you started it; in eating gladly whatever is served without being fussy...  A spirit of penance keeps us from becoming too attached to the vast imaginative blueprints we have made for our future projects, where we have already foreseen our master-strokes and brilliant successes. What joy we give to God when we are happy to lay aside our third-rate painting efforts and let him put in the features and colors of his choice! (St. J. Escriva, Friends of God)
