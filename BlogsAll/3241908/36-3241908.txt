         There's a new translation of the Bible out that the Archbishop of Canterbury is praising for its "extraordinary power." Well, its extraordinary all right ... extraordinarily funny and heretical, which is no small accomplishment. Its the  Good as New  Bible (or as Dom at   Bettnet  puts it "Satan's Bible") and here are a few samples. For one thing John the Baptist is now called the Dipper, Peter is Rocky (get it?), and Jesus isn't the Son of Man because he's actually The Complete Person.  MARK 1:10-11  Authorized version:  "And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him. And there came a voice from the heaven saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."  New:  "As he was climbing up the bank again, the sun shone through a gap in the clouds. At the same time a pigeon flew down and perched on him. Jesus took this as a sign that God's spirit was with him. A voice from overhead was heard saying, 'That's my boy! You're doing fine!'"  1 CORINTHIANS 7:1-2  KJV:  "Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, [to avoid] fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."  New:  "Some of you think the best way to cope with sex is for men and women to keep right away from each other. That is more likely to lead to sexual offences. My advice is for everyone to have a regular partner."  No it really isn't a joke ... well, ok, it  is  a joke but these people are dead serious. Read more about it on   Catholic and Enjoying It . Be sure to look at the comments because they're almost as good as the story itself.
