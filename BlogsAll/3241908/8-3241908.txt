            GAY MARRIAGE - AND MARRIAGE  BY SAM SHULMAN   Following the debate in the comments boxes (Bravo Linda Gray Kelly post, May 19) is this article which examines the arguments for and against gay marriage. Sam Shulman covers all angles to the issue without resorting to emotion or religion which is refreshing. I especially welcome this because the Church's teachings do not make compelling debate material when talking to people who do not subscribe to those beliefs.  Shulman takes the entire issue back to basics by considering what constitutes the essence of marriage. His writing has a resonance of logic which I have sorely missed in other reasoning and is something that I will remember for future conversations. He also makes a compelling case that women will be the main victims of the destruction of traditional marriage, which is the eventual result of the legalization of gay marriage.   This article is required reading for anyone who honestly wants to consider what marriage is ... and is not. He also states what has been one of my main thoughts on the subject from a strictly secular point of view but which I have not seen expressed elsewhere:  Insofar as I care for my homosexual friend as a friend, I am required to say to him that, if a lifelong monogamous relationship is what you want, I wish you that felicity, just as I hope you would wish me the same. But insofar as our lives as citizens are concerned, or even as human beings, your monogamy and the durability of your relationship are, to be blunt about it, matters of complete indifference...  That is not because you are gay. It is because, in choosing to conduct your life as you have every right to do, you have stepped out of the area of shared social concern in the same sense as has anyone, of whatever sexuality, who chooses not to marry.  Thanks to John for the heads up on this article which originally appeared in the November 2003  Commentary  magazine.
