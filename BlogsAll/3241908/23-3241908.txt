         Our Sunday night ritual is for the girls and me to watch Alias. Sometimes Tom joins us while working on his laptop, looking up just long enough to point out gaping plot holes. Hey, we can handle the plot holes as long as we get Sydney's fab aliases and kick-boxing. Sure, there's some gross violence but that's balanced out by the fact that Jack and Sloane are the coolest old guys on TV, while Vaughn and Sark are some of the cutest young ones. However, this season has been a distinct disappointment. The first half was a long, boring soap opera while Syd tried to regain her memory and the last half has turned into some kind of X-files wanna-be. This just becomes more apparent as we have been watching the 1st and 2nd season DVDs. It is so bad that the girls finally have gotten to the point of vowing to skip next season if the first few shows aren't improved. Believe me, if those devoted fans are swearing off, the show has nowhere to go but down.  Alias has enriched our lives beyond just Sunday night bonding, though. I actually was declared "cool" by both daughters AND their friends after putting together an outfit for Hannah's birthday at Urban Outfitters based on what Sydney would wear. That's never been a goal of mine but was gratifying just the same! (The only other time that's happened was when I started this blog ... although I'm sure they will rarely read it.)
