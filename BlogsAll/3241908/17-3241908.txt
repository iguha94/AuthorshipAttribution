         Our Friday family movie night featured this sweet Australian movie which I almost had forgotten.   The Castle  is an understated comedy about a man whose home truly is his castle. When the local airport wants to buy the property, which any normal person would jump at as it sits at the end of an airport runway and directly under gigantic power lines, he fights in court for the right to keep his home.  The main thing I remembered from seeing it long ago was the father's unconditional love and approval of every person in his family. Watching it as a family I was reminded that the entire family reciprocated those feelings. Watching the local news the father turns to his daughter, the only family member with a "college degree" (from hairdresser school), and tells her that they have "ripping bodies" but their hair really could use fixing up to be like hers. Needless to say, the daughter's hair is horrendous but her pleased and loving reaction underscores the family's complete happiness. If they think about the outside world at all it is to be sorry that the world doesn't have a share in their contentment and "riches".  Hannah and Rose loved it and both said that if more families were like this one the world would be a better place. Very true. A word of caution: this movie is rated "R". The only reason I could see for that rating was language. "F***" was heard occasionally, especially whenever the lawyer was trying to fix his copier (I had much sympathy for his situation!).
