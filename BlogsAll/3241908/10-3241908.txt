         Yesterday's post about Linda Kelly prompted an interesting conversation in the comments boxes. It echoes those I have found myself in during the last few weeks thanks to the gay marriage laws. What I liked about the comments discussion is that it covered most of the points of view that I have heard.  This morning I read the   Navarre Bible's  commentary about Luke 6:36 which is Jesus saying, "Be merciful, even as your father is merciful." It perfectly summarizes how to show compassion while not losing sight of error which I think is something that is too easy to forget from both sides of the argument. People tend to go all the way in either direction, either with all encompassing tolerance that allows no fault or laying down the letter of the law with no compassion for personal struggles. This is a good reminder of how to tread that fine line.  We should also show understanding towards people who are in error: "Love and courtesy of this kind should not, of course, make us indifferent to truth and goodness. Love, in fact, impels the followers of Christ to proclaim to all men the truth which saves. But we must distinguish between the error (which must always be rejected) and the person in error, who never loses his dignity as a person even though he flounders amid false or inadequate religious ideas. God alone is the judge and the searcher of hearts; he forbids us to pass judgment on the inner guilt of others: (Vatican II,  Gaudium et spes , 28).
