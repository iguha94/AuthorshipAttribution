         IN SUNDAY'S DALLAS MORNING NEWS   Dom Bettinelli  has this breaking news which came from Rod Dreher. Head over there and take a look. The comments are just getting started on this one.  On Sunday, The Dallas Morning News will begin publishing the results of a major yearlong investigation into a largely uncovered aspect of the Catholic sex abuse scandal. The series of stories are international in scope, and will make headlines nationally and overseas. I’m not at liberty to disclose details yet, but I’ve seen advanced copies of the articles, and they are devastating. I believe at this point, more details will be available on Friday morning, when one of the reporters on the series does an interview on National Public Radio’s “Morning Edition.” The stories will be available on the dallasnews.com website starting either late Saturday night or early Sunday morning.  Just my luck, I'll be out of town until late Monday. I guess if its really huge news I'll see it in Canada. I believe Rod on this one. Maybe this is what it will take to bring the bishops to the point where they have to face the consequences of so many years of neglect and inaction in their duties. Or maybe this is what it will take for the Vatican to finally step in and clean things up.    My guess  is this is to do with the scandalous way that I've heard a lot of seminaries are run ... lavendar mafia anyone? If so, it is about time that these stories are splashed everywhere. No true change will happen without that being exposed and cleaned up.
