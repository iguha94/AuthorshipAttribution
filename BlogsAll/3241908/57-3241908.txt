         Last week I read Peggy Noonan's weekly column and had a immediate identification with her comments about daily living in New York City during this time of terrorist alerts. That was not the main thrust of the article but it made me realize that on a subconscious level the threat of a terrorist attack is never far from my mind. I always have "Just in case..." running through my head. When my gas tank gets down to a quarter of a tank I fill up thinking, "Just in case of an attack and a run on the gas pumps." When a prescription runs low I don't wait until there is just one pill left before getting it refilled. Planning for a family vacation out of town I think of what extras we'd need in case transportation got shut down and we couldn't return until a few days later than planned. I've always been a planner and, like   Noonan , I don't dwell on it but it always underlies everything.  In New York right now we are planning our Memorial Day weekends. We know we are in a difficult historical time, but we do not dwell on it. We don't always even think. We free-associate, like this:  I should get a new dress for the graduation at the Saks sale. They could blow up the Lincoln Tunnel. Meg would love one of those little Chanel knockoffs from the street vender. If New York is bombed while we're in Boston, where will we stay? If Boston is bombed while we're at the graduation, how will we get home? Bring cousin Holly's number in northern Connecticut. Pick up mascara.   From the dire to the banal. No, not from one to another but both interweaved. Having the jits and planning the party. People are dieting because summer's coming and wondering if an al Qaeda hit on New York would trigger a food shortage.
