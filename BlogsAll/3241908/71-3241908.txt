         This was Magnificat's meditation of the day for yesterday. I really loved the way this was phrased ... that we render thanks to God by using His blessings to bear fruit.  Our souls are like earth sown with good seed, maintained with diligent care. Now we must produce; the seed must become a plant and bear fruit. Very often we ask the Lord for his blessing; we must also render thanks; and we will do this by using his blessings and making them bear fruit. We must perform good works, and the slightest act of self-renunciation, of mastery of our instincts and reform of our bad habits, will give great glory to God.  Now we are going to prove that we have understood Christian life. We always want to receive; let us also think of what God has the right to demand of his chosen vine that he has cherished with so much love. We have so much to give thanks for; and so little time in which to do so. It is most urgent that our lives produce something, and that we finally prove ourselves to be Christians. An ancient described the Christians as "Christ in bloom." Do we truly show Christ visibly, or are our branches dead or poisonous thorns?  Let's resolve to take action. Even if our activities be modest, that doesn't matter. But let our decision to make the divine graces visible be more energetic and more loving -- let our lives not be spent merely in tempest.
