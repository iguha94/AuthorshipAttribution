            AJA  by Steely Dan  Listening to John Mayer with Hannah in the car I found myself with a powerful craving for music that had something more ... edginess, spark, funk ... personality. Yeah, that's it, personality. I found myself wishing I had Steely Dan on CD.  I couldn't wait to get home and play Aja for Hannah. She's a pleasure to play old music for because she's always more interested in the quality of the guitar playing than how current the CD is. We may never know what Hannah thought of it because an art project got in the way. I, however, was surprised and pleased to find it much better than I remembered. You can't live with an eclectic music lover like Tom for so many years and not soak up an inadvertent education in listening to music. I was able to appreciate it in a way I never did those many years ago on the car radio or as background music in my dorm room (yes  that's  how old it is).  If you haven't heard Steely Dan before I'm not sure exactly how to describe their music. Funky. Soulful. Fusion. Progressive. Jazz. Rock. Whatever ... its refreshing after listening to the likes of John Mayer and Norah Jones. It certainly won't put you to sleep. The only unwelcome surprise was that we merely own Aja out of all the Steely Dan albums. Time to hit the music store.
