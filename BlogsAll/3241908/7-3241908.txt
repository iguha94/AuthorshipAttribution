          At times, you will be able to speak about eternity, when present trials will be transformed into glory; but it isn't very often that you will be able to speak so directly. By keeping in the bottom of your heart, however this intention of leading these souls to God, you can at least try to give some human hope ...  Know how to stress the least disadvantageous side. Know how to emphasize what is pleasant. Point out those things that are better than they were the day before. In short, don't let the day go by without bringing your provision of comfort. You know very well that a friendly voice is enough to set restless and troubled minds at ease. Be one of those who notice when the thermometer is rising, and not one of those who is always pointing out that it's getting colder ...  Finally this spirit of blessing, of praising, the actions of grace that your belonging to Christ should give you, will be translated practically into good humor: unaffected good humor, penetrating sweetness, and true simplicity; no artificial jesting which breaks forth like laughter, but allows the spirits to plunge again into gloom. No, you are going to be the little smile which, though delicate, on certain winter afternoons reminds people of the springtime, and is its foreshadowing, and shows that life and the joys of living are things that are still possible and not dead and buried.  There are enough people who bury every budding hope. You, you be one who brings hope out into the light.   Mother Marie des Douleurs, via Magnificat magazine
