           THE AMAZING RACE  Ahhhh, life is good. The Amazing Race is back on the air ... the only "reality" show I ever cared about. Ok, it isn't a reality show at all but at least it doesn't pretend to be. It is just the best game show ever. All the challenges of the game bring out the best and worst in everyone.  The girls and I have evaluated all the pairs ... not from their possibility of winning, but from those that we like the best. You know, the ones who  should  win. Yeah, its girlie, so sue us ... we're girls and its  fun!  Charla definitely is the coolest person of the entire bunch. We thought that she'd never be able to keep up with the running. Turns out that she more than compensates for that by being the smartest, savviest, and calmest under pressure. It doesn't hurt that she knows exactly how to get extra help from bystanders as a "little person" and that she sees everything from a different angle. Her cousin is pretty lucky to have a partner like that. The top pairs: little person Charla and her cousin Mirna; the moms who are best friends, Linda and Karen; dating couple Brandon and Nicole; married couple Chip and Kim.  Everyone else has a fatal mean/selfish streak in either one or both people so we cross our fingers that they will be eliminated. It figures that the pair we hated most, Alison and Donny, nipped into first place. Oh well, we'll see what next week brings.
