         1.You and your best friend have a crush on the same person and if she knew, it could cause some tension between you. You: 	sit down with your friend and talk things out. 	hang out like usual, and pretend there's nothing wrong. 	mope around trying to figure out what to do. 	get into a fight with her about it in the hallway at         school. 	let her have the crush--friends are forever. 	figure out how you can both be happy--there must be a way... 	flirt up a storm--may the best girl win! 	lose interest in that crush before it becomes an issue.  2.In your family, you play the role of: 	the guilty conscience --you and Lisa Simpson are psychic twins. 	the diplomat--you make sure everyone keeps talking to each other. 	the good girl--pure and simple. 	the caretaker--sometimes it feels like you're the only adult in the house. 	the bully--you rule the roost. 	the joker--you keep them in stitches. 	the sensitive one--you spend a lot of time weeping over your diary. 	the know-it-all. 	the pacifist--you avoid conflict at all costs.  3.Which of these websites are you most likely to book mark? 	your friend's blog or website--you're helping her redesign it 	a yoga site 	Google search engine 	PETA 	MarthaStewart.com 	poetry.com 	"The Onion" 	"The Wall Street Journal" 	Oprah.com  4.Where do you see yourself ten years from now? 	married with children--you want to be a stay at home mom. 	the youngest executive at a big company 	still trying to figure out what you want to do 	content with your life, whatever it is you're doing... 	working for a cause 	owning your own business--who wants to work for other people? 	traveling the world 	employed as a social worker 	still in school, getting a graduate degree  5.You'd rather spend a Saturday afternoon: 	online, working on your fledgling advice column. 	watching an old foreign film. 	volunteering at a local social services organization. 	going to a Tori Amos concert. 	watching the Discovery Channel. 	working. 	babysitting some neighborhood kids as a favor to your parent(s). 	shopping at the mall. 	hanging out with your grandma and/or grandpa.
