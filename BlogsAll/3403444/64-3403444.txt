         Advanced pirate lingo; or On beyond â€œAarrr!â€  Once you've mastered the basics, you're ready to start expanding your pirate vocabulary. Try these for starters  Beauty â€“ The best possible pirate address for a woman. Always preceded by â€œme,â€ as in, â€œCâ€™mere, me beauty,â€ or even, â€œme buxom beauty,â€ to one particularly well endowed. Youâ€™ll be surprised how effective this is.  Bilge rat â€“ The bilge is the lowest level of the ship. Itâ€™s loaded with ballast and slimy, reeking water. A bilge rat, then, is a rat that lives in the worst place on the ship. On TLAP Day â€“ A lot of guy humor involves insulting your buddies to prove your friendship. Itâ€™s important that everyone understand you are smarter, more powerful and much luckier with the wenches than they are. Since bilge rat is a pretty dirty thing to call someone, by all means use it on your friends.  Bung hole â€“ Victuals on a ship were stored in wooden casks. The stopper in the barrel is called the bung, and the hole is called the bung hole. Thatâ€™s all. It sounds a lot worse, doesnâ€™t it? On TLAP Day â€“ When dinner is served youâ€™ll make quite an impression when you say, â€œWell, me hearties, letâ€™s see what crawled out of the bung hole.â€ That statement will be instantly followed by the sound of people putting down their utensils and pushing themselves away from the table. Great! More for you!  Grog â€“ An alcoholic drink, usually rum diluted with water, but in this context you could use it to refer to any alcoholic beverage other than beer, and we arenâ€™t prepared to be picky about that, either. Call your beer grog if you want. We wonâ€™t stop you! Water aboard ship was stored for long periods in slimy wooden barrels, so you can see why rum was added to each sailorâ€™s water ration â€“ to kill the rancid taste. On TLAP Day â€“ Drink up, me hearties! And call whatever youâ€™re drinking grog if you want to. If some prissy pedant purses his lips and protests the word grog can only be used if drinking rum and water, not the Singapore Sling youâ€™re holding, keelhaul him!  Hornpipe â€“ Both a single-reeded musical instrument sailors often had aboard ship, and a spirited dance that sailors do. On TLAP Day â€“ We are not big fans of the capering, itâ€™s not our favorite art form, if you will, so we donâ€™t have a lot to say on the subject, other than to observe that the common term for being filled with lust is â€œhorny,â€ and hornpipe then has some comical possibilities. â€œIs that a hornpipe in your pocket, or are you just glad to see me? Or both?â€  Lubber â€“ (or land lubber) This is the seamanâ€™s version of land lover, mangled by typical pirate disregard for elocution. A lubber is someone who does not go to sea, who stays on the land. On TLAP Day â€“ More likely than not, you are a lubber 364 days of the year. But not if youâ€™re talking like a pirate! Then the word lubber becomes one of the more fierce weapons in your arsenal of piratical lingo. In a room where everyone is talking like pirates, lubber is ALWAYS an insult.  Smartly â€“ Do something quickly. On TLAP Day â€“ â€œSmartly, me lass,â€ you might say when sending the bar maid off for another round. She will be so impressed she might well spit in your beer.
