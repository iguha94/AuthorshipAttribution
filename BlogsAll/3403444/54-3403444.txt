         Chorus I'm a pirate! That I be! I sail me ship upon the sea! I stay up late - till half past three! And that's a peg below me knee!  Yo Ho, my friends I have a tale of treasure, plunder, sea and sail my story's bigger than a whale it gets so deep, ye'll have to bail.  Chorus I'm a pirate! That I be! I sail me ship upon the sea! I stay up late - till half past three! And that's a peg below me knee!  I like to fish, I like to fight I like to stay up half the night When I say "starboard" ye go right! Me ma, she says, "Ye look a fright!"  Chorus I'm a pirate! That I be! I sail me ship upon the sea! I stay up late - till half past three! And that's a peg below me knee!  I've got no hand but that's me hook! I pillage stuff but I'm no crook. Me booty's in this chest I took. They'll write about me in a book!  Chorus I'm a pirate! That I be! I sail me ship upon the sea! I stay up late - till half past three! And that's a peg below me knee!  And that's all there is to this song. I hope it hasn't been too long. A pirate's life might just be wrong So grow up nice and big and strong!  Chorus I'm a pirate! That I be! I sail me ship upon the sea! I stay up late - till half past three! And that's a peg below me knee!    i love pirates!!!!
