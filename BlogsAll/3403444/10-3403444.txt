         You know your in MAYHS when… Your principal forgets to come to class Your vice principal tells you to take off your pants One teacher lets 3 kids leave class to pop 3 bags of popcorn Your principal cant read or write English (or any other language) When your principal asks who doesn’t like Davida and the whole class raises their hands When your Spanish teacher says bnos Your basketball team never wins! Mural on the wall has skiing; no one skis in your school Freshmen go out with seniors You watch star wars in Spanish Your teachers your best friend You actually have donuts every day Does the boy’s lounge have games and the girl’s lounge has nothing You can roll out of bed in the morning, throw a skirt on and come to school Is the bathroom 99 degrees and classrooms 65 degrees Do people have snowball fights and go sledding during lunch Can you use your name as an excuse to get out of everything Do you get carpeting before the leaks are fixed Does your vice principal interrupt your davening to tell you the page numbers Can you go to 12 classes in one week- total Your bus driver waits around school….. all day Am I trusted with a glue gun, paint and an empty classroom No one wears shoes You paint all day long Your teacher for that period walks down the hall and asks where your supposed to be    if you have anymore write them in the comments and ill add it in
