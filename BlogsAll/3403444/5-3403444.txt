         one day im going to talk only in cliches how fun will that be?  it's better to find a whole worm in your apple than half a worm. The apple doesn't fall too far from the tree You can't teach an old dog new tricks work like a dog every dog has its day it's a dog eat dog world let a sleeping dog lie talk 'till your blue in the face Eat to your heartâ€™s content. be still my beating heart distance makes the heart grow fonder Home is where the heart is had love in his eyes and lust in his heart eat your heart out Laugh all the way to the bank. Laugh till you cry. Laugh, Laugh, I thought I'd die. you're barking up the wrong tree fell down the ugly tree and hit every branch If a tree fell in the forest and no one was around, would it make a sound? everything but the kitchen sink sink or swim don't lose your head round third and head for home a solid head on his/her shoulders put a price on his head she would screw a snake if she could get someone to hold its head Make like a baby and head out Empty as your head. looks like she was hit in the head with a bag of nickles. Don't tick him off or he'll bite  your head off. i'm shitting my head off running around like a a chicken with his head cut off If your head wasn't screwed on you'd lose that too Wish in one hand, crap in the other, and you'll never be empty-handed One hand doesn't always know what the other is doing.  really fun!
