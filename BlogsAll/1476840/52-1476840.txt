These are the sections of the book that I mentioned last Friday,   Remarkable Reads .  The idea of doing a list like this myself, or with a couple of friends, is intriguing.  Not sure if I could, even with help, come up with a "most Scottish" book, though.  Here are the adjectives used, anyway, for consideration...  The most memorable book I read  The loneliest book I read  The most enchanting book I read  The most important book I read  The most daunting book I read  The most resonant book I read  The most dangerous book I read  The wisest book I read  The classiest book I read  The most eloquent book I read  The maddest book I read The most double-d-daring book I read  The most hippest book I read  The most familiar book I read The most incomprehensible book I read  (quick answer:   I Served the King of England  by Bohumil Hrabal or   Light in August  by William Faulkner.)  The most devastating book I read The most apocalyptic book I read  The saddest book I read  The most fragile book I read  (what, literally?  I have a children's book called "Amy's Long Night" that I got when I was really little that's totally falling apart, but I doubt that that's the point)  The most beautiful book I read  The most tempting book I read  The most fearless book I read The most intuitive book I read The most Scottish book I read  The most technically elegant book I read The queerest book I read  The most exotic book I read  The most smokin' book I read The most seductive books I read  The most elegant book I read  The most surprising book I read The most disappointing book I read  The most unpleasant book I read  The most luminous book I read
