I didn't bring enough for lunch, so I'm thinking about this topic.  Happy for me, there was a Friday Five (from 30 November 2001) to match my mood, retrieved from   here  via Google.   1. What did you have for dinner last night?   Breakfast - pancakes, scrambled eggs & sausage.   2. Do you ever get up for a midnight snack?  Nope.  I sometimes eat something right before going to sleep, though.  Last night it was 3 saltines (woohoo).   3. What's your favorite dessert?  This varies widely.  Favorite of all time would be angel food cake with White Mountain frosting, but that's time-consuming and no one makes it but me.  So, favorite dessert that I don't have to create for myself: chocolate cake with chocolate frosting.  I make a killer Texas sheet cake (the kind with the cooked, poured frosting).     4. Tell us something about you that would surprise us.   I'm not sure that there's a satisfactory response to this.  I'm digging into the deep recesses of my brain.  The best that I can come up with on such short notice is that I have a great story about me and a guy whose nickname was Slimy Rick that I haven't taken the opportunity to tell yet.   Is that adequately surprising?   5. How do you plan to spend your weekend?  Tonight - tracking down T to congratulate/encourage, etc. re: the new job. Tomorrow - catching up on work.  Reading reviews, dealing with the first assignment in the collection development course, researching DVD/CD cleaning and repair units, and editing my goddamned thesis. Sunday - catching up on correspondence & making a new mix CD with which to torture my colleagues.  Tee hee.
