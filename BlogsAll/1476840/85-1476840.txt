Via   The Catalogue Blog , the   Librarian Stereotypes  questionnaire:   1. Own a cat(s)?  Yes, two, but they've lived with me since long before I broke into this profession so I hardly see why it matters.   2. Drive a small sensible, economical car?  Yes.   3. Wear comfortable, sensible shoes?  Nope.  Today I'm practically barefoot (Birkies), while yesterday's choice was my ugly but much-loved white-on-white Asics wrestling shoes.  (They're sort of like   this  only less flashy and have no black on them at all.)   4. Read constantly?  Yup.  In fact, I'm chomping at the bit to go to lunch so I can get back to my book.   5. Never go out?  Nope.  Can't get out enough.   6. Sexually inexperienced?  I'm torn between equal parts discretion (newly-found, but discretion nonetheless) and the desire to dispute the ill-conceived notion that librarians are somehow sexless.  I'll save myself by deflection - I don't think that I qualify as a "librarian", per se, as I'm not degreed.  So I don't have to answer.    7. Friends are all librarians?  Nope.  Lots of 'em are, but lots of 'em aren't.  (And lots of the librarians I've met couldn't be further from my notion of 'friend'.)   8. Could[n't] care less about fashion?  (Thanks, Annie, for correcting that common but egregious misuse!) This is a tough one.  Let's put it this way: I "care", but I don't obey.   9. Lean to the left when it comes to politics?  Yup.   10. Were a nerd in high school?  No?  I'm not sure if I can answer this accurately.  Perhaps someone who knew me in high school could.  I guess I wasn't at the top of the social heap, but I wasn't the bottom, either.  I had lots of friends.   11. Wear your hair in a bun?  Never.   12. Constantly covered in dust?  Yes.   13. Librarian by day/Bacardi by night?  Nope.  Now it's more of this: Slack-assed fuck-up who's playing music way too loud and internally screaming for Bacardi by day/Diligent student or full-timish librarian working on review journals, etc. at home by night.     14. Do you wear glasses?   Theoretically, but practically only when I can't avoid it.  I wear contacts 361 days a year.   15. Are you female?   Yup.   16. Abilities in the yarn arts?  Nope.  I can't even fold sweaters accurately.
