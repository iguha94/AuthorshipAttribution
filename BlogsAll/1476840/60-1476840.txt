 The Color Quiz    Your Existing Situation    Working to improve her image in the eyes of others in order to obtain their compliance and agreement with her needs and wishes.     Your Stress Sources    Has an unsatisfied need to ally herself with others whose standards are as high as her own, and to stand out from the herd. This desire for preeminence isolates her and inhibits her readiness to give herself freely. While she wants to surrender and let herself go, she regards this as a weakness which must be resisted. This self-restraint, she feels, will lift her above the rank and file and ensure recognition as a unique and distinctive personality.     Your Restrained Characteristics    Wants to broaden her fields of activity and insists that her hopes and ideas are realistic. Distressed by the fear that she may be prevented from doing what she wants; needs both peaceful conditions and quiet reassurance to restore her confidence. Feels that things stand in her way, that circumstances are forcing her to compromise and forgo some pleasures for the time being.     Your Desired Objective    Feels exhausted by conflict and quarreling and desires protection from them. Needs peaceful conditions and a tranquil environment in which to relax and recover.     Your Actual Problem    The unsatisfied desire to be respected, to stand out from amongst her friends, is causing some anxiety. As a result, normal gregariousness is suppressed and she refuses to allow herself to become involved, or to participate with others in their ordinary activities.    Sorry, but this doesn't sound like me at all, particularly the Restrained Characteristics.  If anyone else takes this, I'd be interested in knowing the results and your feelings about their accuracy.
