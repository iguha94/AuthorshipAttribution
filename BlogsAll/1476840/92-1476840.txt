 The Thursday Threesome :   Onesome: Something old -  Do you have anything that you've owned simply forever? A cherished childhood toy, an antique handed down through the family...   An ancient copy of  Amy's Long Night  by Nancy Garber.  The covers fell off when I was maybe 8 years old, about the age of the Amy in the book, who decided to stay up on the night of her 8th birthday with her dog, George.     Twosome: Something new -  Buy anything new lately?   Other than the rampant consumerism pre-Miami, there hasn't been much non-book buying lately.  I ordered some photographic supplies from   Light Impressions  and   bookends  from Kitchen-Plus.com.  Does that count?   Threesome: Something borrowed -  Ever borrowed anything and never returned it?   A leather-bound copy of Walt Whitman's   Leaves of Grass  from my high school library.  I loved the book so much that I couldn't do without it.    I felt guilty at the time, and every time I saw it or read it, and every time I thought about it.  As soon as I could afford it, I replaced it with a new leather-bound copy with a cash donation tucked inside.  It doesn't make up for what I did.   Bonus: Something blue -  See anything blue from where you are? What is it?   The jacket to the CD that's playing (The Housemartins'   Now That's What I Call Quite Good ), parts of my shirt, the apple in which Professor Frink resides (Frink Different!), postcards, Cubs uniforms.
