"Poets die young -- younger than novelists, playwrights and other writers, a U.S. researcher said on Wednesday.   "It could be because poets are tortured and prone to self-destruction, or it could be that poets become famous young, so their early deaths are noticed, said James Kaufman of the Learning Research Institute at California State University at San Bernardino."  For more information, read   the article  on Yahoo!  “For a man to become a poet he must be in love, or miserable.”  Lord Byron  “Poetry is the journal of a sea animal living on land, wanting to fly in the air.”  Carl Sandburg  “Poetry is the eloquence of truth.”  (unknown)  “Painting is silent poetry, and poetry painting that speaks.”  Plutarch  “Poetry: where I encounter what is not in memory but arises through a kind of instinct, deep-running, inventive.  Recognition of something I don't know I knew; something I know only as I write and a poem begins to deliver itself, to assert a reality, startling but oddly familiar.”  Martha Cooley, in  The Archivist   “We make out of the quarrel with others, rhetoric, but of the quarrel with ourselves, poetry.”  William Butler Yeats  “Poetry is the synthesis of hyacinths and biscuits.”  Carl Sandburg  “Romance and poetry, ivy, lichens and wallflowers need ruin to make them grow.”  Nathaniel Hawthorne, in the preface to  The Marble Fawn   “…much of poetry is really about letting yourself know what you know, about making intuitive connections.”  Alisa Kwitney, in  Does She or Doesn’t She?
