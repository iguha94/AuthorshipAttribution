Yesterday was a 99% wasted day.  (The 1% is reserved for some amazing news that I heard, but I'm not sharing yet because it's not widely known and anyway I want to just feel it bubbling away in me like mental Champagne for a while.)  - It was the first day I worked in the post-Jinny era.    - "My" big Christmas present - an   Alpine CDM-9803 In-Dash CD Player  - had a good day without me, as it has since it was installed.  I was also informed (rather sanctimoniously) how to turn it off, by the person to "gave it to 'me'".  - I emailed a good friend from high school with whom I'd reconnected over the last year by email, but from whom I hadn't heard in a while.  The message that I sent was short and I didn't really think about what I wrote until after I clicked "send", whereupon I realized that I sounded like I was expecting an apology - and I'm actually expecting to give one.  I feel like a jerk.  - Cutting a particularly funny or apropos comic strip from the newspaper last night, I wasn't paying attention to the end of the (very sharp) scissors and cut a divot in the end of my ring finger.  Well, more of a ravine than a divot.  It didn't even hurt - that's how deep the cut was.  It's making me type very slowly and badly.  It's my 2WSX finger.  Will today be better?
