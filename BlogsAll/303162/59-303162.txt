         I had my Godparents and mom over for dinner tonight. It just kills me that these key people in my life are getting older ...  My Godfather's humor can be a little crass for me, but tonight he was on his best behavior. My Godmother was having an off night. Occasionally she'd get out a full phrase or idea, but mostly she struggled.  While she and mom were off talking about something in the kitchen, he talked to me about the situation for the very first time. There were points I thought he would cry. He told me that he sees her slipping fast. That she can no longer cook like she used to and it is difficult for her to even follow the simplest of directions. All my life she's been my favorite cook. I was thinking just the other day that I needed someone to teach me how to finely chop onions. It made me sad to know that I missed out on the chance for it to be her.  Claude said that he prays every day for God to give him the strength to make all the right decisions that day. When I asked how her moods were, he told me that she's been having temper tantrums, which I was afraid of. When we are together she is quick to react to something ... the most simple of things ... in an ugly way. In the past, I've told mom that when the time comes she is going to me a mean Alzheimer's victim.   It makes me very sad. She has been one of the kindest, most generous persons in my life. She was the epitome of a Godparent. I am afraid that I will learn to miss her long before she is gone.
