         The viewing tonight was really nice. It was hard seeing Phyllis, but at the same time, as I sat and listened to all the people talking and laughing at the funeral home I thought,  Phyllis would have  loved  this .  I was grateful to the people who would see my mom and say, "Oh Kay. How are you doing?"  I was glad that people acknowledged what a loss this is for her. Inside the viewing room there were pictures of Phyllis and her family. There was also a picture of Phyllis and mom.   I sat on the couch for a while, just waiting so mom could talk to everyone. I noticed two ladies talking about me. I heard one explain to the other, "I don't remember her name, but that's Phyllis' best friend's daughter." It made me smile.  Mom really hates that title. She thinks it's not true because Phyllis had so many friends. Some for nearly 50 years. We talked about it in the car, how it made her uncomfortable. I told her,  But mom, you were her special best friend and she was yours.  "Yeah."  She told me Saturdays would never be the same. They always used to go to Estate Sales. I would tease them,  You guys are supposed to be taking stuff out, not bringing it in!  [If you could see their homes, you would understand why.]  I spent a lot of time with her grandson, Kyle. We laughed a lot. We joked about those final moments before she passed. That final decision she had to make ...  Let's see, get well and go to Las Vegas one last time ... Or Heaven? Las Vegas? Heaven? Vegas? Heaven.
