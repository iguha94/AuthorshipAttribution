          Can I quit now?  The houses I can afford are questionable, at best. The neighborhoods I really, really wanna live in are really, really out of my budget. Waahhh!  All I want is a house with hardwood floors and central air conditioning (key in South Texas, but not necessarily common in the homes I'm looking at). Two or three bedrooms. One or two bathrooms. ok, it definitely has to have at least one bathroom. Sort of central town, not far from work or mom. Unfortunately the houses seem to range from really expensive to  I wouldn't want to be here at night .  We went inside nine houses. Of those, only one was something I would consider. The negative was an add-on room that seemed of questionable quality to me. If it hadn't been there, I definitely would be considering at least one house today.   Most others were hideously ugly and would require a lot of cosmetic work to improve the appearance. I also learned blue is a very popular color. Walls, tiling, entire kitchens or bathrooms, sometimes the whole exterior. Blue. And not a lovely shade of blue either. And linoleum, lots of linoleum. Much less shag carpeting than I expected. Hallelujah for that!  The house I liked most was just a drive-by without the realtor. I looked up the appraisal price minutes ago: $119,900. A house like that would require no meals on my part, which would be good for the diet, but not good for my demeanor.
