         Who can pass up a Thanksgiving   This-or-That ?    Stuffing: baked inside the turkey, or separately?   Baked inside.   Fresh or frozen turkey?   Either one works for me. I'd like to try Cajun-fried some time.   Cranberry sauce: jellied or whole berry?   Neither. Not much of a fan.   Stay home or visit friends/relatives?   We always used to have Thanksgiving and Christmas at my mom's house ~ probably the first 25 years of my life. Now we go to my Godparent's son's house. I suspect they are going to try and get me to do Christmas this year ...   Do you cook Thanksgiving dinner, or let someone else do it?   Someone else has done the turkey and I've always brought side dishes. Maybe for Christmas ...   Traditional turkey dinner, or an alternative (such as vegetarian)?   Traditional. For both Thanksgiving and Christmas. Although for Christmas, my Godfather usually smokes the turkey.   Regular potatoes or sweet potatoes?   I love both.   Homemade gravy, or the jarred stuff?   Homemade, although I usually go without.   What part of the turkey do you prefer...dark or white meat?   Both.    After dinner: football or Christmas movies?   Nap.  Basically we've eaten the exact same meal every Thanksgiving and Christmas my entire life. Maybe a side dish or pie change once in-a-while, but always, always turkey. Never ham or something else. Sometimes I just wish we could break out of the mold. Be adventurous. Try new things. But, alas, I can tell you that ain't gonna happen.
