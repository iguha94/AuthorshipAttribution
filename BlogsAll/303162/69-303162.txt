         Whew. I'm tired and my house is still a mess. But I must confess, it was a successful day. I bought a clothing armoire and dresser (while I was out getting cash for the a/c guys) for $170! Both are in excellent condition and the bonus was free delivery! The dresser looks great in my living room, so that's where it's going to stay for now.  The a/c guys left about 4 p.m. (too blinkin' hot) and are coming back at 7:30 a.m. tomorrow. Everything is covered in sheet rock dust (from cutting the vent holes). Stuff is not where it's supposed to be ... it looks like a disaster zone!  OK, back to the good parts of the day ... My friend Sandy came over with plantings from her yard for my yard. Since I have never been a plant person, I cannot remember the name of it to save my life right now (lantana?). I really appreciate the gesture. (My mom says you are not supposed to say "thank you" when someone gives you a plant. It's supposed to be bad luck.)(?)  After everyone left, mom and I started wallpapering the kitchen. It looks awesome. I'd say we're more than halfway done. We should be able to finish tomorrow. I hope the a/c guys finish at a decent hour so I can get to cleaning! (Now me wishing to clean is a place I never thought I'd live in!)
