         Whew. I'm tired. Mentally. Emotionally. Physically.  I feel like I could sleep for two days.  My body feels beat up and my mind feels fried. And I'm not the one getting chemo-ized. (hey, that rhymes!)  Which makes me wonder,  In a situation like this, who is it worse for? The person experiencing the cancer or the person watching?   Was that just a Carrie Bradshaw ~ a la Sex in the City ~ "question of the episode" moment?  I keep saying we did this and we did that like I have cancer too. But I don't. But I do. It's been a long nearly three months in this journey since diagnosis.  So much torment over this decision.  I am so relieved to hear her tell someone "it was a piece of cake."  Again tonight she brings up her worries of a lowered immune system and getting sick.  I tell her to think heathly.  I hope that as she wakes up tomorrow and sees she is still healthy, that she is still herself ~~ that the negative worries will disappear.  She's been manifesting this worry to her hips and leg (a known trouble spot).  Literally paralyzing herself with fear.  Tonight at a church dinner (yes, she is feeling  that  good) she was running around like a mad woman. Hop up and run get mayo. Hop up and run get cookies. Hop up to say hi to someone across the room.  A little later (after hopping off to do something), mom sat back down and commented how her leg wasn't hurting her at all.  When I took her home I tried the "maybe it really was stress" tact again, but she's not going to take that on. Not just now anyway.  She talked about how it hurt so bad at night (gee, not cause you're laying there thinking about anything, no unt-uh . . . ).  I let it go and told her to call me if she feels funny in anyway at all.  Then I told her I thought she made the right decision and that I loved her.
