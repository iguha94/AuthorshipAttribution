         I don't know why, but I was just compelled to read through some of my archives from August and September. A time when this blog was about cancer. It makes me see that a life blog is a good thing. Reading the entries brought it flooding back and I could picture every scene.   Mom has an appointment with the oncologist Monday. She is still not feeling well and believes he will not give her treatment again. She took one course of antibiotics, but not the second. She felt the first one did nothing. We have had many conversations in the last month about calling the doctor and getting a different prescription, but she never did.  I could hear the relief in her voice yesterday when she told me she doesn't think Dr. Kalter will do treatment. It's as if she doesn't want to get well so she doesn't have to take this last treatment. Yes, the  last   course of treatment. Why can't this be over already?!  I told her that I thought she should be prepared for him to be a little unhappy with her.  Well, what I am supposed to do?!  she said with great tone (this is over the phone). With a firm grip on my parent hat I told her, "You should have called the doctor and gotten a new prescription," followed by a disappointed silence. She conceded that yes, she should have and that she will ask for something new  Monday .  She called me later to see if I wanted to do dinner, but I had to work late. She knows I'm not happy with her. But really, treatment has already been postponed twice from Dec. 3 and 10.  Here we are 4-5 weeks later and she's  still sick . Plus, she really has had this hacking cough since mid-November. She complains that going to the doctor and getting medicine is too expensive for her. She refuses to allow me to pay for it. I don't know what else to do but guilt her into it.
