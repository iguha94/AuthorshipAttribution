         Brrr. Only in Texas can we go from wearing shorts and sandals one day to freezing the next.  I think I am pretty much done with my shopping. I am debating one more item for mom. I am thinking an outfit or shoes. I haven't decided. I may get up at crack 'o dawn tomorrow and hit the mall with the masses.   I went to the grocery store at 8:30 a.m. (can you even believe I was up?) to beat the crowds. One of my gifts includes a six-pack of beer, which I totally forgot you can't buy before noon, so that means another trip to the store later -- when everyone is already up.  Can you tell I am into crowds?   Yesterday I was so rage-against-the-traffic. So not me. I really tried to have the "now be in the holiday spirit" attitude, but it didn't work. I think it has to do with the whole not-liking-the-people-I-work-with thing and trying to decide what to do. I told mom yesterday that I am thinking I will look for a new job next year. I was totally hoping for the ten year pin, but I don't think I can hold out that long. Now to figure out where I would like to go and what I would really like to do. Maybe it's my 40's mid-life crisis, just a few years early.  I am putting off the inevitable. Wrapping presents. Don't get me wrong, I like wrapping presents. I just find Christmas to be so not-Christmas-like anymore (I am into dashes this morning!). I can hardly believe tomorrow is Christmas Eve. It just feels surreal. Like life is going along at this extraordinarily fast clip and I am just barely keeping up. I keep thinking,  When did I get so Scroogish? When did I get so cheap??  So is it that if you don't have any kids Christmas is just no fun anymore? Especially when you get stuck doing dinner and such with people you really don't like? I just wish I could do something different.  Yes, I know I have been bitching about this for years now. But here's my dilemma, I can:  a) spend the holidays with mom (and get stuck with the others unless we travel far away) b) not spend the holidays with mom  Granted, she may live to 100, but she's 77, I just can't take the time we have together foregranted.  So here I am, joyfully and eagerly awaiting the holiday.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Tonight a Christmas party at Sandy's. Finally, some kids to get excited with!  Do I sound like my biological clock is ticking? It's not. Not really, anyway. Some days I'll see something that makes me think,  Oh, I'd like one of those.  But most days I don't. I love being around kids, but I am also glad to go home  by myself .  Some days I wonder if it would change who I am (for the better). Most days I know I will never know.  Whew, this is awfully philosophical so early ... o.k., not so early in the morning.  Perhaps I need to go wrap now ...  p.s. for those of you who lost sleep last night, my template is back today!
