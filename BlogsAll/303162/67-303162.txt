          Lesson for the weekend : If you request one telephone service to end on Saturday and the other to start on Monday, that means you can't access the internet. Duh.  Oh, and if the cable people can't come until Friday, that means six days with  no television !!! I can't even get the local channels ...  Well, it's not like I don't have enough to do, right?  The donation truck came bright and early Saturday, then we went to Best Buy and got a new television. Luckily, mom and I were prepared enough that we had time to wait around for the movers.   Naturally, the minute they showed up it started raining. Three hours later when they were unloading into the house, it was  pouring  rain. We really need it, so I can't complain one iota. However, now I need to figure out lawn stuff cause its been raining since Saturday. I look at the rain and think immediately that it means bad luck, but we need it so badly I've decided it must mean bountiful blessings for me in this new house.  Mom and I have finished tiling the office and my computer is all set-up.  The orange walls with the black and white tiles looks fabulous ~ even if I do say so myself.  The place just looks so chaotic. Last night I made sure to pull out the iron so I'd be ready this morning, but I forgot where I put it. I'm pretty tired, so my brain isn't quite fully engaged.  I've been sleeping really well, considering it's a new place with new sounds. It's the manual labor that has me tuckered out.  I think I may take off Wednesday and use the really long weekend to get things sorted out. I must have 30 - 40 boxes to unpack. Really, I had no idea I had so much stuff!  I will feel better when the place has some semblance of order.
