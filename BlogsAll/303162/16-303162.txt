J.K. Rowling. I adore the Harry Potter books. They are the only books I have read multiple times ~~  ever .    2. What album "speaks" your life clearly?  The last CD that fully spoke to me was   Jagged Little Pill  by Alanis Morissette. She was angry. I was angry. It was the perfect relationship.   3. Where would you live if you could live anywhere else?  London.   4. What play or movie has had a big impact on your life and why?  One of the few movies I can watch over and over is   Field of Dreams . The scene where Ray and Anni discover they had the exact same dream about Wrigley Field gives me goosebumps every time. More than baseball, it's a movie about finding your dad. I don't know that it's had a big impact in my life, but I guess a part of me will always be searching for my dad.   5. What person in your life has influenced you the most and why?  My mom. The good and the bad of who I am come from her. Sometimes I wish I had a little more of the good and less of the bad.
