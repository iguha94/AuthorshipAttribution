          New Year, New You  This is what I am working toward. I started by losing some weight and plan to continue on that journey. But, more than anything I need to figure out where (and why) I lost my  power  and find it again. To that end, this blog may get really boring as I look to find questions and answers to my life.   They must often change, who would be constant in happiness and wisdom.  -- Confucius  That's me, looking for change. The January issue of   InStyle  (the article is not included on-line) has a series on  New Year, New You . It includes a series of questions that are interesting to me.   Today I start with  7 Questions To Ask About Your Life :   1. Can you recall a meaningful family moment in the past week?  Christmas was nice. I'm not sure how  meaningful  it was.   2. Have you stopped asking, "What will I be when I grow up?"  No. Guess that means I am not doing what I am  supposed  to be doing. But, what is that??   3. When did you last help someone less fortunate without using your checkbook?  Ummm, Day of Caring back in October. We worked with the ARC Group. Severally mentally and physically disabled adults. It was really hard and made me feel really sad. Gee, you'd think since my job is to coordinate the volunteers I might actually   volunteer   on occasion.   4. What was the last, spontaneous, even, silly, thing you did?  God. When did I get this old?   5. When you hear the word "home," what comes to mind, chaos or comfort?  Chaos. I either need to find myself a good cleaning person or learn how to make cleaning a habit.   6. Do you spend time alone indulging yourself without guilt?  I spend an extraordinary amount of time alone. Indulging myself? Not usually.   7. Imagine yourself in 20 years looking back on your life today. Any regrets?  Yes. Whew. I don't think I am ready to touch this one other than acknowledging I will be disappointed in myself if this is all there is.
