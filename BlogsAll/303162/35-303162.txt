         Is it time to join the masses and buy a PDA? I am so in need of some organization. I make lists, use a paper and a Notes calendar, yet I am forgetting things. Important things.   Yesterday I remembered something that needed to be out by tomorrow [normally takes 3-5 business days]. Today I come in all la-di-da after lunch like I have a free afternoon to find I am 10 minutes late for a meeting. Earlier in the week, I was going through a stack a papers only to find some things that should be on my "To Do" list that I  totally  forgot about.  This is really unlike me [see the Miranda description?]. I've been thinking [yesterday and today] that maybe a PDA would shake me up some [with the "new toy" factor] and get me back on track.  Now the deal is, what to buy? There's the ever-popular   Palm . But, do I choose the beginner   M100  or go for more memory with the   M105 ? [2mb/$95 -vs- 8mb/$149] I really like   Handspring , but they've discontinued the   Deluxe  and the next model,   Neo , at $200 is out of my budget.  Then, there is the   refurbished  option. The price makes it really affordable, but it only comes with a 90-day warranty [and what happens on day 91?].  *sigh* Maybe I just need a brain transplant.
