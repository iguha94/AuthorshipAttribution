         Wednesday night mom and I drove by three houses sent by the realtor. One would cost the price of the house [at least] to get it cleaned up [gorgeous old historical house]. Then Sue sent another on Thursday, so I called to see that one and the other two. By then, one of the other two was gone already [again!].   One house was a resounding  no  [there have been lots of those]. The other had potential. It's really a nice house, but it's not one that I walked in and thought,  oh this is it  [cause now I know what that feels like]. Two bedroom, with a nicely converted garage that could be a third bedroom or office. Good hardwood floors, decent kitchen, pink bathroom [floor, walls, the whole nine yards].   It would do just fine, but it's not like I love it. I would need to have central air and heat put in and repairs made where the window units would be taken out of the walls [uh, hello? They call them   window   units for a reason!] Sue sent over the owner's disclosure yesterday and asked if I wanted to put out a contract. It was so f-r-e-n-z-i-e-d at work [literally at one point I was running the halls], I never called her back and today she is out of town.  *sigh* Is it too much to ask to find a house that I  love  that I can afford?
