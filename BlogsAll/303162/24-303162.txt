         Yes, o.k., so I know I am the only person on the planet who shows up at her bosses house on time and leaves at 10 p.m.  sharp . I'm a nerd. So what? I arrive before anyone else (actually one person beat me today -- first time out of like six parties), make witty conversation and be the center of attention for my 15 minutes.  I don't drink too much or become obnoxious, and I leave before people start spilling their red wine on the white bedspread, leave their foot prints in the master bathtub or yell obscenities at the Episcopalian minister that lives next door (true stories). Mind you, she is an Executive Vice President in a $360,000 home. The woman controls our raises. I hope my good behavior is worth something someday.  I brought home $20 worth of scratch-off tickets (the person who won my Pier One candle & holder didn't seem enthused). It was, in all, a pleasant evening. It's catered with two waiters. Nice hors d'oeuvres, salad, pasta, dessert and alcoholic beverages.  Thank God for my friend Jill.  She is truly my lifesaver. I am so grateful she's moved to our department. I will probably leave the bank when she is moved to "fix" another project.  I felt like I looked good. I wore a velvet outfit ~ sleeve-less top, long shirt, bare legs and Christmas mules, with a red, glittery sweater over my shoulders (it's too warm to wear). I didn't over-indulge, but I did enjoy a bit of everything. Back on the diet tomorrow.  Now I am listening to   Nigella  cook. Really, if I were a guy, she would do it for me. Voluptuous, licks her fingers a lot, obviously loves food ... Course, I love   The Naked Chef  too. Maybe it's the accent.
