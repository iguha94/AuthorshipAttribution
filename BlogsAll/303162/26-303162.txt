         So, I think I am getting bored with my job. I struggle each day to force myself to get work done. Yes, I know right now I should just be damn grateful that I have a job (Imagine working at Enron. Everyone gets fired. Stock at $0.26. What 401(k)?!).  I just had off 11 days and now I can hardly wait until Dec. 21, when I get off 12 more days.  I have things I need to write and I just can't force myself to do it. I wander the halls. I surf the net. I read the paper(s). Sure, I get stuff done everyday, but I am not churning out the work like I normally do. Someone called me the other day and asked who they needed to talk to now about the A-Team.  Well,  me .  He truly said, "Oh man, still? I don't know how you do it."  Some days I don't either.   Yes, I know that of the last nine+ years, I have basically been doing the same thing for six of those years. That any other sane person would have run screaming from the building by now. But most of the time I have liked my job. Found it easy to do. I want to snap out of it so I still will. I don't want to come complacent, but these days I don't seem to want to be there either. I sure wish they offered sabbaticals.
