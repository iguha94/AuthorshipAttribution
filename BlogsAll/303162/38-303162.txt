         It sure was good to see Lee. In the last ten years I've seen him three times. I could just choke my brother sometimes.  It means a lot to me that he chose to come to see us an adult. And, he could've chosen to go running with his two buddies, but he spent the day with us instead. Which made me really happy.  We basically ran errands and went to   The County Line  for a late lunch. He had the five meat platter. Yep, the metabolism of a 21-year-old. I'm sure we were pretty dull, but he was a trouper and was good about opening doors and "yes ma'am-ing" mom.  I look at him and see a life that hasn't, and probably won't, reach full its potential. He dropped out of high school and when I asked today about his GED he told me he has re-taken the last part (but didn't include whether he passed and I didn't push it). He was such a smart little boy. He was so full of life and hope for the future. Have I mentioned yet how I just could choke my brother?  I asked a million questions (just my nature) and he answered them all. While mom was in the bathroom at lunch he showed me pictures of his ex-girlfriend in her stripper outfit. She was gorgeous (but he's pretty cute too). It made me feel conspiratorial in a way that he trusted (or was that tested) me with the pictures.  It makes me wonder if he remembers the relationship we had when he was younger. He was one of my soulmates. One of my kindred spirits. I still feel connected to him. I hope he'll come back. I'd do anything to have a relationship with him.
