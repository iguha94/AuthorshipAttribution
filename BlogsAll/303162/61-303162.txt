          Funny point of my evening.  Mom and I met at my house [I still love to say that ...  my  house] to measure my windows for a sale at Target. Then I gave her a load of laundry to throw in at her house while I picked up a prescription. When I got to her place, I threw the sheets into the dryer, we went to Target and had dinner. Back to her place to get my sheets, plus I throw in another load. I tell her,  We really don't need to do the curtains tonight  [it's after 9 p.m. by now]. "Oh, let me go get the wall hangers."  Oh, ok.  I drive to my house. I pull in the drive-way. She says, with great surprise, "Where's my car?!"  At  your  house !! She'd forgotten we'd made the transition [mind you, she sat her purse on her car while we were at her house!] We laughed for a long time.   No so funny point of my evening.  When I first got to mom's house I went into her bedroom to see where the roof was leaking. I nearly fell over. Her ceiling and wall has huge black chunks of mold. I about near had a heart attack. It was like someone punched me in the stomach. We have so many mold houses here that sometimes they just tear them down [and all their contents] rather than try to salvage anything. Literally, I had to leave the room. I go sit on her couch and happen to look up into a corner. Again, near heart attack when I see the wall buckling apart ~ like the back room [an addition] is separating from the rest of the house. There is a meeting with   FEMA  on Wednesday at the local high school that we are definitely going to. Her house is in big trouble.  Oh, and it's raining again.
