         The   Friday Five  (holy smackers, these are hard!):   1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year?   Learning that I am strong enough to face any challenges life may bring my mom. Even though hers was a "simple" cancer, hearing the word, having an oncologist, choosing chemotherapy, getting treatment ... watching strangers die ... I always worried what I would do when the day came. And now I know.   2. What was your biggest disappointment?  Oh, I'm sure I could come up with one (or 12), but right now I am listening to Oprah's   Thank You Day  show, and she has survivors of September 11 on. It makes me feel like my disappointments are a little petty.   3. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions?  Yes: lose 12 more pounds (I've lost   18  since Sept. 4 ~~ although I may be up a few with all the holiday goodies. Who knew eggnog was such a weakness?); try to get in a little exercise; have a more structured budget; travel more (only two trips this year. Wah!); and find my  power .   4. Where do you wish you were celebrating?  Golly. The possiblities are endless. In Reed City, Michigan, with my Aunt Patsy and Uncle Fagan. In Sherborne, UK, with cousin Howard. In Salt Lake City with Karla and Roger. Perhaps London or Paris or someplace in Italy. Australia. A quiet beach in Costa Rica. Walt Disney World. Bet you can't figure out what I would do if I won the lottery!!   5. What do you plan to do for New Year's Eve?  I enjoy going to Linda's. We play games, watch TV, drink a little, eat a little, laugh a lot.  Sounds like a plan to me.
