         And I just thought I'd spend the day packing ...  Mom and I met a carpenter at the house to get a bid on the work I need done (will get bid tomorrow). After a brief detour to Foley's, we ordered the tile for my kitchen/office (large black and white tiles). Then we picked up my Godmother and headed to Lowe's to buy an   armoire  for my new television (yet to be bought). The loader guy laughed when we said we were going to put in a Honda, but we got it all the way in and closed the trunk. Getting it out was a whole different story. Really, if I'd had any idea, I would have called someone to help me with it. It must've weighed 175-200 lbs!   After wrestling it into mom's garage, we did lunch and looked at five more furniture stores (I need something to use as a pantry).  After I dropped them off, I met Elizabeth and we saw   Lilo & Stitch . I really enjoyed it. I was surpised that in their largest theater, full of families, we actually had six adults in a row with no kids. I guess some of us are just still kids at heart.  We went to the new   Longhorn Cafe #2  for a burger. It was quite pleasant sitting outside. The tempurature was agreeable and there was live music. Frankly, I'm surprised I'm not asleep yet!
