         The   Friday Five :   1. What's your favorite vacation spot?  Since favorite seems to indicate multiple visits, I’ll go with visiting family in Michigan. I have a tie for my all-time favorite vacation: Disney World and London (gee, that seems like an oxymoron).   2. Where do you consider to be the biggest hell-hole on earth?  The first time I drove through Oklahoma the roads were so bad I thought it would damage my car in some way.   3. What would be your dream vacation?  Wow. There are so many places I want to go. Right now, I would say an expense-is-no-object tour of Italy. I just finished   Under the Tuscan Sun: At Home in Italy . I would love to find a small villa to stay in and really experience a moment of life in Italy.   4. If you could go on a road-trip with anyone, who would it be and why?  My mom, Aunt Patsy and Uncle Fagan. Because I think we would have a fun time, an interest in the same sites and a desire to move at the same pace. Although I would want to stay in nicer places and they would want to use campgrounds (with their fifthwheel).   5. What are your plans for this weekend?  I am looking at a house tomorrow (yikes!). Probably cruising neighborhoods and looking for others. Tomorrow night is a barbecue and auction (live and silent) for the school at the church I grew up in (my mom works there fulltime, but I no longer attend services). Sunday the weather may dictate what happens.
