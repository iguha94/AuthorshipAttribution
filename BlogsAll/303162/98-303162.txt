           The Friday Five :   1. What was your most memorable moment from the last week?  Tuesday as a whole was a pretty good day. I was in a fabulous mood all day long.    2. What one person touched your life this week?  Actually, my boss did on Monday when she acknowledge me during staff meeting for how I’ve handled this transition of my favorite project to someone else (today is my last official day).   3. How have you helped someone this week?  I try to do something every day. Answer someone’s question. Help figure something out. Offer a compliment. Open a door.   One thing I’ve done this week might seem odd. We have the Cow Parade going on in San Antonio. There is one cow in front of my office that I just love. It had been struck by vandals too often. Last week it was taken in for repairs. This week it has been “attacked” again and some of the repairs broken again. Each night I have picked up those pieces and yesterday I called the Cow Hospital to let them know I have them. May seem silly, but I really like that cow.   4. What one thing do you need to get done by this time next week?  Some writing for work.   5. What one thing will you do over the next seven days to make your world a better place?  I will volunteer tomorrow with children on an art project. This will be my third time (probably out of five) to work this particular project for our library’s centennial. It is so much fun and kids need to know that adults ~ outside of their family ~ care about them.
