         After several months, mom finally committed today to chemo for her cutaneous t-cell (mycosis fungoides) lymphoma on her nose.  Hallelujah!    She starts treatment on Friday.  Supposedly this first drip will be a "bear."  I am curious to see what this really means. Like violently ill? Vomiting? Fever? Aches and pains? Is it an exaggeration?  I'll let you know.  The course of treatment:    Immunological therapy - Rituxan   once-a-week for eight weeks This is the drip therapy that starts out a bear and gets better. My notes from the first visit with the oncologist (6-14-01) say it will take 3-4 hours to work though (which I understand she will do in-office).   Chemo - Leukeran  This pill is taken twice daily for three to four months.  Dr. Kalter promises no nausea or hair loss.  I am afraid. Afraid of my roll in the decision-making process. For as much as I professed I would wait for her to decide on her own, the waiting was killing me. I'd come home almost everynight and cry at some point in the evening. Worry is exhausting.   I finally had to put on my parent hat and for as much as I believe chemo is the right decision, she needs to believe it too. Sometimes our fear makes a situation worse than it would/should be.  I hope her fear doesn't get the best of her. I hope this time next week her fear has turned to joy in realizing that she will survive this  and  kick it in the ass.
