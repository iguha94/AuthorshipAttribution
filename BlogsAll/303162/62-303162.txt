         Twas a fun day. Mom and I ran and looked at some furniture this morning before meeting Linda, Kelly and Kristy for lunch. We again celebrated Kelly's promotion. Then we went bowling. I pretty much suck, but we have a grand time just goofing off.  Linda and I used to work in the same department. We used to traveled together a lot, grew to respect and trust each other, and learned we just had fun together. Even though we don't work together anymore, we do as much together now as we did then. We haven't worked together for several years, but our relationship we continue to do a lot of things outside of work.   Kelly and Kristy are her daughters. Linda is 15 years older than me and I am 14 years older than Kristy. It's like Linda has become my older sister and Kelly and Kristy are my younger sisters.  They call my mom "mom" and I call their grandmother "grammy". I feel fortunate to have them in my lives.  Then mom and I hit Pottery Barn and Hardware Restoration. Really, I must stop shopping soon.  I came home to tidy up a bit because my friend Karla is coming to see the house tomorrow. She and I also met at work before becoming roommates. Eventually she married this really great guy and they moved to Salt Lake City. Now we only see each other once a year, but we talk lots on the phone. She's passing through town on her way to Houston with her mom and niece. We're meeting for breakfast in the morning and then they are coming here. Even thought the place is still disjointed, I know K will see my vision.  Mom and I talked about that some today. I told her it is hard for me because I have never really developed my own "style". Most of my stuff has come from here and there to make do for the time being. Now it's time for me to really start looking at who I am and how I want this house to reflect that.
