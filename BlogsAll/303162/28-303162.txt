         I have to go to Houston tomorrow and I am so not wanting to pack. I think I'll do it in the morning. Really, I'm a good morning packer. I don't forget anything. It comes from traveling like 80 days a year back when I was a trainer. You learn what you need and what you don't.   I'm glad to be earning the   Southwest Airlines    Rapid Reward  credits. I   need   to take some vacation  s   this year. I find that travel really feeds my soul. Makes me a better person. Fills a void in my life. I really think it is my life's calling. If only I could figure out how to afford more of it.  Back when I was training, I earned like 16 tickets in two years. It enabled me to travel a lot. Inexpensively. (The hostel in Vancouver is like $11/night and the train ride from Seattle is awesome -- I highly recommend it.)  Last year, I earned one measly ticket. I really have the free-plane-ticket-withdrawals. To woo me back into the friendly skies, SW is offering me six points per flight instead of the requisite four. With the rental car and hotel points and another trip next week I should earn a ticket. Plus, I still have the ticket earned last year.   Where shall I go?  I ache to return to   Disney World  [  Jeff  I can hear you groaning from here] because there really is something there that touches my inner child. I have never had a more joyful vacation. The UK trip is my favorite holiday, but there's just something magical about The World.  I'm planning to go to Chicago and Salt Lake City this summer for conferences. I'd really like to go to London, but for some reason Southwest just does not fly there. I really loved Seattle. I could visit David in San Francisco, but I want to go someplace  new .  Maybe Portland. Or Baltimore (really, DC). Or maybe I should decide if I really want to buy a house and focus on that. Sigh. What I need to do is win the   lottery . If only I could remember to buy a ticket.
