         Lunch with the ladies was   four hours   long!!  Me, a 58-year-old, three 70-year-olds and an 82-year old. Whoo-hoo!!  We did go to a   cool place  that included unique shops.  The best part of the afternoon for me was running into my former best friend's mother (follow that?). I truly believe there are certain people placed on this planet we are destined to meet:  soul mates . Tricia was one of those people for me.   It was one of those instant connections. She used to get so mad when people would ask us how we could be friends because we were so different. I was the straightlaced "normal" one and she was the unconventional "peace out" girl. But, we just clicked. I kept her feet on the ground and she made sure I was always reaching for the stars.  In the end, she was involved in a relationship with a jealous, selfish person who was threatened by me. She was forced to choose between us (and not by me).   It was so great to see her mom and hear how everyone is doing. As we left, she encouraged me to call Tricia. I hesitated for a moment before telling her,  It was not my decision for us to not be friends anymore.  She looked me in the eye and said, "I totally understand what you mean. That happened to us too, until we had the big 'get over it, we're your in-laws' talk. It's been much better since then."  I am glad to hear things are better for the family. I know it was  ugly  for a long time.  I still miss her (it's been nine years). I hope someday we can be friends again. With or without the jerk.
