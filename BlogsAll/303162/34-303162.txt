         I did a bad thing today. And no, I'm not talking about the four ~ yes, count 'em ~ four boxes of Girl Scout cookies I bought [Thin Mints ~ who can resist?]. I took a nap. Just like an hour nap. Now I am wide-awake.  It was an interesting day. Not a good day for my Godmother. Lost words. Incomplete thoughts. Yet, she is so happy to have us for company. So glad to get out of the house. Do something different. It's hard not to want to more for her.   Today I was able to pretty much guess her train of thought. But it is hard to watch someone who can no longer figure out a menu. Typically she orders whatever one of us gets. Today it was soup and salad. She gets lost from the drink dispenser to our table around the corner. I can see it in her face from across the partition. She is  lost . I point at our table and she nods.   She asks me two or three times over the course of the three hours we are together who paid for her lunch. I remind her that I did. Each time she thanks me profusely. I know that she does not remember each previous conversation.   I know it is terribly difficult for mom. I can see her lost-ness too. Her friend of over 50 years. Slowly slipping away. Her running buddy, Phyllis, now living in another town. She is increasingly clingy. I've spent time with her five of the last seven days. She is lonely. I can see it in her.  I looked more carefully at the nose today. Well, as carefully as you can without being obvious. I am still undecided if there is something new there. I will keep watching.
