         A few years ago, the "black sheep" of my mom's family passed away. Uncle Robert had extracted himself from the family years before, but in the end rallied the troops when he knew he was dying. We knew he'd died of cancer, but never knew what kind. When we visited the radiologist, he recommended we get a death certificate and find out for sure. It arrived today. He died of lymphoma. Needless to say, that's a little too close for comfort for me.  Earlier in the day, Sandy called to let me know an old friend's father died yesterday. Roberto and Sandy dated in high school and college. I was always the third wheel. I told her I thought I would go to the funeral. She said she might ask her husband to go. We laughed that it would be the same old thing ~ me with   her   date.  Oh, and when I looked up the cemetery online, I read that someone we graduated high school with is the manager of the cemetery. His nickname was Smile because he was such a funny, smiling guy. And now he works at a cemetery. Funny how life works out.  I also found out today that my ex-fiance has gotten married. There was an immediate thunk in my stomach, but then I looked at her picture and thought, "Oh, she's cute" and it all passed very quickly. I'm glad for that.  And, hey, my friend Jeff is an extra in   The Alamo  shoot tomorrow! Whoo-hoo! I know a famous person!
