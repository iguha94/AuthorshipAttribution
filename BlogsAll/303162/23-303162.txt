         There's something I must confess. Something I've been thinking that makes me feel terribly guilty. It's been going on a while now. A thought process I haven't had in  years . Let alone felt the need to say out loud. Fear of the repercussion, I suppose. But, here goes ...  I wish it would stop raining.  Really, I never thought I would say that again. Not while living in San Antonio anyway. We have had so many years of drought. Of water restrictions. Of brown grass and endangered species. The wish for it to stop raining? I feel guilty!!  But, it has rained every weekend this month.  Notice, I did not say all month or some similar descriptive that would allow you to believe that it rains during the week too.  Oh, no.  These are lovely weekend rains. Yesterday it rained so hard and for so long that:  a) I had to give up on my Christmas shopping. Something about dripping through a store is not appealing (to me or the store), and b) I worried that it would progress to a true San Antonio flood (hence canceling the office party, but no luck there).  And now, again today:   an 80 percent chance of showers or thunderstorms with Flash flood watch through noon .  But, it will be sunny tomorrow.  Whoo-hoo.  I think it is some sort of Christmas conspiracy. Punishment for waiting until the very last paycheck available to buy the bulk of my gifts. A pox on my poor attitude about buying gifts for people I never see, plus the ones I don't even like (the mom guilt thing, remember? I can't figure a way out of it and my ego is too big to buy cheap/ugly gifts).
