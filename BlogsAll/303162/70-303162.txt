         How apropos! As I sift through the 1,035 e-mails that were waiting for me, I decided to check out the   Friday Five  … and it's about work!    What is your current occupation? Is this what you chose to be doing at this point in your life? Why or why not?  I am an Employee Communications Manager. I am responsible for our weekly newsletter, corporate intranet and our statewide volunteer corp. At this point I choose to stay here, but I do think about whether or not this is what I am meant to do with my life.    If time/talent/money were no object, what would your dream occupation be?  To own a specialty bookstore (ie: travel related books only) with a café. Or be a full-time volunteer at agencies who can utilize skills like mine (writing, training, strategic planning, etc…).    What did/do your parents do for a living?  Mom did clerical work at two insurance agencies.  Has this had any influence on your career choices?  If nothing else, it made me want to go to college.    Have you ever had to choose between having a career and having a family?  Not so far.    In your opinion, what is the easiest job in the world?  In relative terms I think every job is easy/hard at some point in time.  What is the hardest?  Being a parent.  Why?  The enormous responsibility of raising a child!
