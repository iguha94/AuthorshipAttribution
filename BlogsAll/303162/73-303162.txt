         Well, I am officially tardy. I don't remember turning off the alarm, but I must have. Maybe my subconscious is gearing up for the next two days. We have a huge   Habitat for Humanity  project this weekend. The bank and other financial institutions have come together to build a home. We're going with the "competitors coming together" theme. We're part of a national program that kicks-off on Saturday.  We're having a large number of local elected officials, plus the continued rumor that George W. will show up since he's just down the road at his ranch ...  Tomorrow I am taking a team of girls to build a wall frame that the all-male executive team will raise at a press conference on Saturday. Yes, I do love the irony in that, five girls taking care of business for the big boys. Then I have another team of workers on Saturday. Part of my job is to coordinate our volunteer activities statewide. My role in this project is to coordinate the volunteers from the eight local companies.  So basically I am spending the next two days in shorts and tennis shoes out in the blazing Texas sun. And since there is nothing built yet, there is no shade in our area. We have to be at the construction site at 7:30 a.m. (remember, I am usually still in bed at that time), and Saturday will be a particularly "high drama" morning.  Plus, I have a wedding at 3 p.m. on Saturday and a birthday party at 6:30 p.m. for a 10-year-old. Whew. I can see why I am tired already!
