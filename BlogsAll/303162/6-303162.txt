         Tomorrow is d-day. Or should that be c-day? Our first day of treatment. I feel a whole range of emotions.  I can hardly wait for Saturday.  Then tomorrow will be over.    I am taking the day off so I can just hang out with her.  I don't know that they will let me. But I'd be worthless at work anyway.  I hope I can help entertain her or, whatever. Just to help her get through what is supposed to be the worst of it.  O.K., so I am terrified.  I don't think I have ever seen my mom sick.  I mean really sick.  She's beeen healthy all my life.  There's that part of me that never wants to see her vunerable, although I must see it all the time.  Dang this parent hat.  She told my brother on Tuesday. I'm glad for that. He needs to know.  For as much as I hate the parent hat, I'd rather be wearing it than be him anyday.  I know there are lots of people out there praying for my mom, thinking positive thoughts. I am so grateful for that.  I am grateful for all the kind words and just plain gracious treatment I've received these last few months. I am so lucky to know so many good people.  That's what they say in a crisis, right? You find out who your true friends are.
