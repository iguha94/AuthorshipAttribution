         I officially adore Boulder. The weather was  perfect . Really, by Texas summer standards, it was  perfect . Highs near 80&deg;, but mostly it stayed in the 70s. We even had 50s and 60s while in Estes park (the car thermometer told us so).  Kim's house had breathtaking views from the top of a mountain outside of Boulder. The party was a blast, especially the private concert by   Terri Clark . I'm not a huge country music fan, but I really enjoyed her show. She has a great voice, is funny and was totally gracious off-stage ~~ signing autographs and posing for pictures. She made a fan out of me. She has a new song coming out this month that I predict will be a hit, "I Just Wanna Be Mad."  We did Estes Park on Sunday. I was not a happy camper when I figured out I left the camera battery in the charger back at the hotel. I missed some stunning view shots, elk up-close and my trek to the top of the mountain (yes, I confess there was some wheezing involved). Elizabeth took a picture of me at the 12,000+ feet sign. I hope I can scan it into my Yahoo album with the pictures I uploaded tonight.   Kim treated the 12 of us to dinner at   PF Chang's . It was especially delicious since we don't have one in San Antonio. Yesterday we did   Pearl Street Mall . It's a very cool outdoor shopping area.  While it was hard to come home (especially since our plane was two hours late), I felt totally refreshed today. Like I really went  away . No work or other worries on the brain for three whole days. It was   fabulous  .
