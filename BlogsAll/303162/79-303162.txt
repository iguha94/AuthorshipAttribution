         Today was Paul's funeral. Seems Sunday after church he drove himself to the local hospital parking lot and shot himself in the head.   He's not the first person I've known to commit suicide. I met Michael on the first day of middle school. I'd gone to a parochial school the first six years. Public school was this weird place full of bizarre people. We met in homeroom. He asked me to go steady. I went home and told my mom. She told me to tell him she said no. We became fast friends anyway.   He was the class clown. Always making people laugh. I remember in high school we would talk on the phone for hours. After we graduated, he went into the service and I went to college. I only saw him a few times after that. I knew he was in town. That he had returned to college. One day he called me. I'd gotten a new job and my picture was in the paper. He wanted to tell me how beautiful I was. He still made me laugh. It was the last time I talked to him.  One summer, after a long vacation, I was going through the old newspapers and found an article I wanted to share with my mom. I called and told her,  You'll never guess what I found in the newspaper!  Michael Powell's obituary?  What?!   Sure enough. The funeral was the day before we'd returned home. I couldn't believe it. I called his best friend from high school. They'd lost touch also. He didn't know. He told me he would find out if it was true and call me back. It was.  He lived in an apartment complex not far from where I live now. He sent his mother in Houston a letter telling her that by the time she received his message he would be dead. The complex manager found him. He'd hung himself.  I was so angry at him for a long time. Mad at myself for letting him slip away. For not making a difference in his life. It's not as hard to think of him now. I keep his senior picture in the top drawer of my dresser. I will never forget him.
