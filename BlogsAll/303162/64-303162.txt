         Today was treatment day. Mom was already there when I got there and looked surprised to see me. "I didn't think you were coming today."  Yesterday I said 'see you tomorrow.'  "Yeah, but I thought you meant tonight." Pause. Squeezes my hand, "thank you for coming." I know she hates the prospect of being there alone. I don't blame her.  They took us back right away and got her hooked up. The room was about half-full. We talked about how we hated to see someone needing to lay down in treatment. That it reminds us both of the man like that before. The one who died.   About two hours in, a beautifully dressed woman, with an entourage of four came in. She was very stylish and perfectly coiffed. They gathered around as she was hooked up to the red bag [red = serious cancer]. LaDonna told her, "Now remember, this is the drug that causes you to lose your hair." The woman replied, "Oh, well then bring me my hat."  From the freezer, LaDonna brought her a "hat" that looked like a specialized surgical cap. Apparently the coldness helps with hair loss.  Mom slept most of the time. It's hard to see her looking so fatigued. To see her deep in sleep and know that some day it will be more of that and less tiling or painting. It makes my heart feel heavy.  A few weeks ago she told me for the first time in my life, "I wish I'd had you 20 years sooner." I know life would be so different that way, but, yeah, sometimes I wish she was 57, not 77. Or even 67. I wish I could extend our time together. I wish it hadn't taken me so long to learn to appreciate her the way I do now.
