         I'm having some friends over tomorrow night. The "Ya-Ya's" we call ourselves.  In our years of meeting near monthly, this will only be my second time to have them to my apartment. Why?  a) because it's a relatively small apartment (perfect for one, crowded for four) b) most of my furniture comes from a "make due" attitude, rather than an "I love it" place c) two have beautifully decorated homes, one has an absolutely perfect two bedroom apartment in a brand new complex d) I get really obsessive-compulsive about it   What should I serve? Is the place clean enough? What if there is a speck of dust in the wrong place  (there probably is).  What if they look in my closet  (which I highly doubt)?  What if, what if, what if.   So, after much consternation, I decide on:  brie spinach dip crackers grapes wine  chili cornbread  Hummingbird cake (for Steph's birthday)  It's cooler outside now and chili is good warm-you-up food. At the store tonight, I picked up a "spicy chili" seasoning packet without really thinking about it. Sigh. My blonde roots show through ...  So, now I have a huge pot of  spicy  chili. Like burning my mouth spicy.  What was I thinking??  Now, I know I am going to toss and turn and fret over this all night and all day. I'm even already plotting ordering pizza as a back up. Oi! When did I get this anal?  That said, if you know how to take the heat/spice out of something (like a potato can make something less salty) ~~  please ,   please   let me know.
