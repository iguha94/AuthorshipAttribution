          A horror of a story from my friend Sandy :  This story happened about a month ago in a little town in Mexico, and even when it sounds like an Alfred Hitchcock tale it's real.   This guy was on the side of the road hitch hiking on a very dark night in the middle of a storm. The night passed slowly and no cars went by. The storm was so strong he could see hardly a few feet ahead of him. Suddenly he saw a car slowly looming, ghostlike, out of the gloom. It slowly crept toward him and stopped. Reflexively, the guy gets into the car and closes the door, then realized that there was nobody behind the wheel.   The car slowly starts moving again. The guy is terrified, too scared to think of jumping out and running. The guy sees that the car is slowly approaching a sharp curve. The guy starts to pray, begging for his life, sure the ghost car will go off the road and he will plunge to his death when, just before the curve, a hand appears thru the window and turns the steering wheel, guiding the car safely around the bend. Paralyzed with terror, the guy watches the hand re-appear every time they reach a curve. Finally, the guy gathers his wits and leaps from the car, and runs to the nearest town.   Wet and in shock, he goes to a cantina and, voice quavering, orders two shots of tequila, and tells everybody about his horrible, supernatural experience. A silence envelopes everybody when they realize the guy is apparently sane and not drunk.   About half an hour later two guys walked in the same cantina. One says to the other, "Look Pepe, that's the asshole that rode in our car when we were pushing it."
