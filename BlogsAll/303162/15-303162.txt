         Mom did well with treatment this week. Went by herself. I thought it would be empowering for her, plus it helped my work schedule. She has had bouts of nausea that pass if she eats something. Otherwise, she's been feeling pretty good.  Yesterday we laid off    73 people   statewide. 34 in San Antonio. I have compiled a list of 28 so far. I've worked with at least half. Some more than others. One from my department.   Many of us have had "What do they do?" conversations in the past that we were unable to answer. But, it certainly feels different to know now they are unemployed. In this economy. With so many others "downsizing" and posting hiring freezes.  I'd say morale is low. With the hiring freeze and salary freeze, and now this. Especially when Dick says that we are not in trouble, that we are making money. I know this is a preemptive strike. And that many let go were on the "what do they do?" list. That 34 out of 1800 is nothing. 73 out of 3400+ is nothing.  They said they hope this is a one time thing. But, they can't make any promises. No, I am not worried about my job. I can prove productivity. I have translatable skills that could be used across the board. I can churn out work. But it is still hard not to feel something. To have a tinge of worry.  It certainly doesn't put me a mood to think about Christmas. It makes me feel Scroogish. I am definitely in batten-down-the-hatches mode. Plus, I hate buying gifts for people I don't even LIKE. Yes, I know I should be able to figure a way out of doing so, but thus far I haven't. There is a certain level of expectation because of the long-term relationships and an greater level of guilt from my mom.   O.K., So maybe I should change the title of this blog to "this is me bitching."
