         I can (and sometimes do) spend hours in a bookstore. Tonight, only an hour.   I went into   Half Price Books  looking for a book on   Portland . I didn't find one, but came away with   Under the Tuscan Sun  and   America's Historic Places .  I also bought   Until the Real Thing Comes Along  and   What We Keep  by Elizabeth Berg because I really liked her   Open House .  Four books for 20 bucks. I'm in heaven. It made me think of a Friday Five question about something you love the smell of, but others probably wouldn't. Books. I love the smell of books.   I have been reading the   Best American Travel Writing . A story a night. The "theme" of the book seems to be catastrophe or trouble in some way. A volcano eruption. Escape from Haiti on a sinking ship. Kidnapping. White water rafting gone amuck. Not what I was really looking for.  Thus far the only story that's spoken to me is Pico Tyler's   Why We Travel , originally featured in   Salon .    We travel, initially, to lose ourselves; and we travel, next, to find ourselves. We travel to open our hearts and eyes and learn more about the world than our newspapers can accommodate ... So travel, for many of us, is a quest for not just the unknown but the unknowing; travel in search of an innocent eye that can return me to a more innocent self … And that is why many of us travel in search not of answers but of better questions. I, like many people, tend to ask questions of the place I visit, and relish most the ones that ask the most searching questions back of me.
