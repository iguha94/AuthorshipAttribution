         Dr. Kalter pronounced mom's nose looked "less angry" and ordered up another batch of treatment for Oct. 1-3.  Oct. 3 is mom's 77th birthday. Whoo-hoo.  Mom asked how many more treatments she would need (guess she didn't believe me or just really needed to hear it with her own ears). A maximum of four times, but I think it will almost be gone after this next treatment, he said.  Guess the other two are for good measure.  In the car she said  I guess there are others who have treatment much worse than mine.   I suppose so, I said. He told her she needed to "eat better" in the coming week. More protein. Perhaps so she'll be able to handle all three days this time. So her nerves won't make her so jittery. So she won't cry.  It's been a wowza week at work. Like everyone else, the economic slump is hurting the bank. Thursday we announced an early retirement package to 265 employees.  No, of course it's not mandatory.    Couple this with a press release about lowering our operating earnings guidance for 2001 and office gossip shot off the Richter scale.  And do people call Dick or Pat? Nooooo, they call  me  ...  Are there layoffs? Are we in trouble? Is it a takeover? What else is coming??   And they are right. It's not over. Yesterday my boss told me that we are enacting a hiring  and   salary  freeze.  This will not be good for the morale of our people. I'm just grateful my raise -- effective Oct. 1 -- is still in place.  The salary thing is announced Monday. I'm glad I'll be with mom getting chemo.  Definitely the lesser of two evils!  I'm not really sure what to do about Mom's birthday. I was hoping Oct. 3 would be day one, so she would still feel well enough to go out for dinner. Now, I don't think she'll feel well enough for cake.  Days three through five were the worst last time.  Maybe it will be better this time.
