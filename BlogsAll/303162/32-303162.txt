         Today, we close the   InStyle   New Year, New You  series with  factor in some fun .   And finally, the most important thing of all to do: Make yourself happy. Laugh a little, play a lot, kick off your shoes and dance in the fountain. Suddenly you'll feel like a kid again ~~ and you know what? You're entitled.   I used to be that person. Where'd I go?   The Constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it yourself.  -- Ben Franklin    8 things to do before you die:     1. Hear your favorite musician play live.  Hmmm ....   Dave  was here last year and I missed out.   2. Drive cross-country with a lover.  Does Georgia to Texas count? It sure felt like a lot longer.   3. Identify, then conquer your greatest fear.  But, then I'd have to go out on a     date   .   4. Spend an entire week all by yourself.  Done. On a solo vacation even.   5. Witness childbirth.  Does TV count?   6. Place a bet in Vegas or Monte Carlo.  Done. Even won some.   7. Make amends with someone you have wronged.  hmmm ... there is a friend from the past I would like to make amends with, but I don't think circumstances ~ or a certain person ~ would allow it.   8. Have your portrait painted or taken by a pro.   Done.    What I want to know is who in their right minds would consider childbirth   fun  ?!  A miracle, a life-altering and truly amazing experience ~~ yes. But   fun  ?!
