         I never go to happy hour. But tonight I was craving dumplings and there's a cool Chinese place downtown that offers 50 cent eggrolls, 35 cent crabmeat rangoons, 75 cent beef screwers, etcetera, along with dollar beer and two dollar belleni's. Jessica and I decided to try it out.  Just as I got there, mom called wanting to know what I was doing. She had a few things she wanted to take to the house and would I mind. I told her that I'd be there in about an hour (Jessica had plans for later in the evening).  When I get home, mom is piddling around and says, "I want to see how the wallpaper comes off in the kitchen." Which really means she wants me to get up on the ladder and try to peal it off. It's just border, so I do. The first layer comes off relatively easy. The glue layer required dampening with water multiple times and scraping. I'm half-way done now. She sat on a chair and supervised. Till she made a 40 minute call to her sister, anyway.  I have striped wallpaper that we are going to do in the kitchen. Just half-way down. It is  bright . We bought it in hopes of finding something that will compliment the orange room off the kitchen. Then we will paint the bottom half of the kitchen in a white to match the white stripes in the paper.  The a/c guy starts next Thursday. Says he'll be done on Saturday. Now, if only the electrician could fit me into  his  schedule!
