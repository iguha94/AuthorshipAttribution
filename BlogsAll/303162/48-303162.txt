         Wow. It's Sunday already. I guess I have passed through the  I must post something everyday  phase. I have come online to blog several times and then decided I didn't want to afterall, so I just go visit my favorites. And then there are the days I haven't turned the computer on at all ....  So, here is a recap of my week:  I finished the last of my Easter candy. BIG **sigh**  I had my second session with my second therapist. I like her a lot.  I joined the   Susan G. Komen Foundation  Education Team to help teach breast cancer awareness.  I am still not happy with work, so I requested my resume from my personnel file. It's been 10 years. I forgot what it said and had no idea where the original was. I'm going to begin building a new one and then I have no idea what I will do with it.  I lost my   Dave Matthews  online auction. I set a dollar amount of what I wanted to spend. It went  way  over that. Ericka and I are still going. We'll be on the lawn, but we'll be there [New Year's resolution, remember?]  It is   Fiesta  here. Yesterday, mom and I did the   Monticello Home Tours  [that's a picture of my high school]. It is the area I really, really want to live in and the six houses we toured reminded me why.  Today we are doing the   Fiesta Arts Fair  with Linda and tonight we are going to the   Botanical Gardens  to see the   Fort Sam fireworks . [I will tape   Alias .]  Yesterday was my Godmother's 73rd birthday. We did a Chinese buffet, which I normally hate, but this one was really good. She was ok talking with me alone, but in a group she looks lost. In the car after dinner she was a little more "out of it". Perhaps she was just tired.   Phyllis died on Friday. I can't even begin to tell you how happy we are that we went to see her last Saturday. We have the memory of that last good visit. Of how much she loved the tulips. The strawberry shake we smuggled in. I am so glad I had the opportunity to tell her in person   I love you  .
