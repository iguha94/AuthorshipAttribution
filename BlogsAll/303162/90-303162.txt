         I'm a little ticked. This morning my Godfather called and told my mom that "they" had decided Christmas dinner would be at son #1's house and it would be  late .   Now, after I got over the initial shock of roasting my first turkey, I got into the idea of having them over for dinner. Figured I would do it up nice and show off a little. I've struggled with Christmas for a while now and I figure this year will be no different. I thought having them over would help the day go by quickly.  My one caveat was that we would eat  early . And by early I mean 2 p.m. They want late, which means 6 p.m. I  HATE  that. There are people I would like to see Christmas day. People with families to see and who are finally getting available at 6 p.m.   I'm very frustrated by this. These are people we've spent every holiday with my entire life. I can pretty much recite the menu to you now because we have had the same basic meal for Thanksgiving and Christmas for my entire life. I am bored with these people, that menu and it makes the holidays no fun anymore.  I tried asking my mom if we could just deliver our gifts on Christmas Eve and do something else on Wednesday, but that was a no go. God forbid we rock the boat (yet they can dictate what we do). I'm going to keep working on this because I am pretty fed up with this situation. It's   my   life dammit!
