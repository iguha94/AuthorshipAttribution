         Apparently, health is going to be a big issue for the   Oprah  magazine next year. Part of the January goal is to get you really thinking about yourself and your life (which always seems to be where I am in January). I'm going to work through her questions and thought maybe they would interest some of you too:   Questions to Get You Going    These questions may seem difficult to answer at first, but the point is to get you digging down to a place where your intentions become clear. Part of this exercise is to remind yourself about what you—as opposed to everyone else around you—need in order to feel happy and fulfilled. If you don't make time for what matters to you, how can others value your importance?     Who am I? How do I think of myself? What are my strengths and weaknesses?    Who do I want to be?    Why am I here? Why am I important? What is my mission?    What am I missing? The time to read a book? A close friendship?    What's my motivation for wanting to improve my food and exercise habits? If it's to look better, do I expect favorable results to bring love?     Am I afraid of making changes or of taking risks (quitting a boring job, getting out of a bad relationship)? Do I fear failure or the responsibility that could come with success? Could I embrace change instead as an adventure?     What has stopped me from keeping resolutions in the past? Is the obstacle (or obstacles) still present in my life? If so, how will I navigate it this time?    When I'm tempted to wander off track, what could I say to myself, or do, to stick with the original plan?    How can I build in support for myself? Ask a friend to be a health buddy? Join a walking club?     What am I doing in my life that's hurting me? Smoking? Drinking too much? Letting work interfere with relationships?    What are the sources of joy I need to feel whole?   Am I happy?
