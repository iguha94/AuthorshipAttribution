         I have a  rant . Why do  some  men think it's OK to touch a woman's body without her permission?  Today, Sandy's niece Kelly received an unsolicited hug from one of her college professors. Post hug, he felt her breast.   I was pretty well developed by high school, so I was the recipient of this type of behavior all-too-frequently. The very first time a total stranger coped a feel, I was embarrassed and felt shameful. Like  I  had done something wrong. Nearly 25 years later, I can remember that feeling vividly.   After that, I figured out it was the man that was wrong and learned to voice myself. Most times it happened at a crowded event and the perpetrator would be gone.   I had adult men ~ one who had known me since birth ~ attempt to tongue kiss me. I thank God I had the fortitude to get myself out of those situations. It scares me to imagine what might have happened.  Once, a long-time "friend" felt me up because he "wanted to know if they were real." I felt so reassured when he decided they were.  How does it happen that  some  men feel this behavior is acceptable?  Parents, teach your kids what good and bad touching is. Tell them it's ok to speak up for themselves. Then when the time comes, they'll know what to do. And they'll get help and/or call the proper authorities, just like Kelly did.
