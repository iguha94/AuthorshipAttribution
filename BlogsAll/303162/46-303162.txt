         There have been deaths in my life that make me think,  OK God, I don't get this one  at all  . There are funerals I have been to and thought,  Who is the minister talking about? Surely not [insert name here].  Today was so different.   I have never been to a funeral that felt so much like a celebration of life. For as much as we will all miss her, we are all glad that now she can breathe on her own. Walk around. See her parents. Her five-year-old son Bubba. Her 20-year-old brother who died in WWII. She is in a better place.  I think part of my peace with this loss is that last visit. I feel so fortunate that I was able to see her feeling good. Talking well. Laughing. I'm glad we brightened her day as much as she did ours. I am glad for all the years we spent together. I'm glad I got to tell her that I loved her. Even though I've felt it for so long, I've signed it on cards, my actions have expressed it ... I don't think I ever said it out loud to her before. I am so glad I did.  I drove mom and two of Phyllis' friends to the burial. They talked a lot about their long-term friendship with Phyllis. It was nice to hear new stories. We joked that when the minister was talking about her competitiveness and love of games that he failed to mention Keno or Vegas.   As we left, I went to hug her daughter good-bye. She thanked me for bringing "the ladies."  I would have come without them.  Then she held my shoulders and looked me in the eye, "You do know how much my mother loved you, right?"  As much as I loved her.
