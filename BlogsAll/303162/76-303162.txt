         Today was our   United Way 's   Day of Caring . I took a team of 10 to work at the Inner City Development. They provide emergency food and clothing, recreation for youth in the Alazan-Apache housing project and surrounding area, a sack lunch for the homeless, and high risk drop-out prevention program. Don and Patty Raddle have done some pretty amazing things in the past 20+ years.  The ICD housed the very first   Habitat for Humanity  affiliate. One of their volunteers knew Millard Fuller and asked him to come to San Antonio to build houses like he was in Africa. While Habitat is based in Georgia, the very first Habitat house was built right across the street from ICD. The only paid employee of ICD lives in the very second Habitat built house.  ICD needed help cleaning out their attic. Four of us suited up to brave the promised "rat-infested hell hole". Mind you, the "suit" was a painter-like coverall, gloves and a special mask for fiberglass insulation. One of the boys told me that I was a "brave woman." But my theory is I cannot send a volunteer to do work I wouldn't do myself. So I was first up the ladder. First to come face-to-face with a "rat" in a mousetrap. Frankly, it looked like a mouse to me, but we saw enough droppings to prove bigger rodents lived up their too. Some were up to a half-inch long. Yech!  We literally pulled every box out of the attic and took it downstairs to sort. The sort process determined if something needed to be cleaned & used now, tossed or put back. I think their stance the last few years has been, "What should I do with this?"  Put it in the attic.  We could tell they had no idea how much stuff was up there. Boxes upon boxes. Eventually we got everything sorted, tossed or returned to the attic (contents clearly marked). It was a great team effort. We were pretty satisfied with ourselves. Course, some of us may not be able to move tomorrow ....
