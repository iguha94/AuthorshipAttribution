         Go   Harry ! I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Go see it ~ now!  At the theater, I saw a former friend. Tricia. In truth, she's a former  best  friend. We had an ugly parting almost nine years ago. I bring this up, because I miss her to this day. I truly believe we have soul mates. People who are supposed to be in our lives for whatever reason. She was my soul mate friend. I've seen her maybe twice in the last nine years, so it was startling to see her today. She looks so different. Linda had gone to the bathroom, so I had time to just watch her. I'd always thought the time would come and we would be friends again. There's this space in my life waiting to be filled by her. And for the first time ever, today as I watched her, I thought,  We will  never  be friends again.  It makes me sad.  After the movie, we met Elizabeth and Kim at Beto's for a late lunch. We sat chatting for over two hours, which was nice because I don't know Kim very well. As we were leaving, E asked me, "What's today?"  Um, November 17 ? pausing.  Omigod. Are you ok?  Two years ago this day (not this date), she was out motorcycle riding with friends. Her partner, Carole, lost control of her Harley, drove into a rock wall and died (they were on different bikes).  I was going to wrap this post up with a nice, neat symbolic something or another. But I can't.
