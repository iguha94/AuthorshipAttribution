         So I find it hard to write about a day the day after. I also worry I use "so" too much.  Yesterday was a hard day. Mom was feeling really puny. Said she spent most of the day sleeping, not eating and drinking very little. I know you do what you can to abate an angry stomach, but she really needs more fluids to flush out her kidneys, etc...  We're headed to the car when she pulls out a small trashcan to take with us,  just in case . I concede my mantra became, "Please don't throw up. Please don't throw up."   We get to the CTRC o.k. (hallelujah!) . We straight back to the treatment room, she sees the nurse and starts to cry. She  really hates feeling sick . I totally understand, but... Cindy hooks her up to some saline and tries valiantly to calm her down. Finally gets Dr. Kalter. He comes in, chats for a minute, then tells her she won't have treatment today, "See you on the 26th."  Huh? Doesn't missing today mean a make-up session? "No, she's got most of the good stuff already." Uh, o.k. Then why are the sessions three days if she doesn't  really  need today?  They pump her up with two hours worth of fluids and a little sedative.  I asked for some too, but they just laughed.  Dang it.  We stop at the store for new fluids and head home. Her spirits were definitely better by the time we left CTRC.    I dunno. I look at the woman in the room with us who has been having treatment on-and-off for five years and I think "suck it up woman and get this last treatment -- this could be what throws you over the top for God's sake!"  Just for the record: I think it, I don't say it. I save the real rantings for here.   I spoke with her this morning. She sounds better and says she feels better. Not dizzy, still queasy. Dr. Kalter gave her some pills to help with the nausea. I told her I'd call later to see if she wanted to get out for a while.
