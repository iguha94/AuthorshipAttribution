         Time for the    Friday Five  :   1. Have you ever had braces? Any other teeth trauma?  Yes. Back when they were all metal. I had four teeth pulled, did the rubber band thing for ever , then a retainer for two years. But, it was worth it.   2. Ever broken any bones?  No.   3. Ever had stitches?  Yes. When I was very young my pinky finger was caught in a car door. It looks now like it took two or three stitches. Then six years ago, I was cut on the back of my knee by a falling mirror. Luckily my roommate talked me into going to the emergency room (she went right for my vanity:  it will be a really ugly scar ). I am so grateful she did. It took forever to heal (it was right at the knee bend) ... it would have been much worse without the stitches.   Thanks KK.    4. What are the stories behind some of your [physical] scars?  On my right knee I have three large faded scars and two smaller scars on my left knee from about age six. I remember it was a really rough push from some boys. Shannon literally carried me inside the daycare and became my immediate best friend till she moved to another school in fourth grade.   5. How do you plan to spend your weekend?  My 21-year-old nephew is supposed to be here tomorrow for a visit. I'm not really sure what to do with him and his two friends. Feed them, I suppose. My friend Michele is having a Super Bowl party Sunday at her new house. I'm undecided about going.
