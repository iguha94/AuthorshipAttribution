         From the   Friday Five , courtesy of Heather:   1. What was your first job?  Working as a clerk in a resale clothing shop. I was 15 and hated it. Have never done retail again.   2. How old were you when you had your first kiss?  I'm thinking we were 10 or 12. It was Valentine's Day and the boy from across the alley had a box of those hearts with writing on them. He finally got to the one he was looking for, said  Read this . Being clueless, I did.  Kiss me . And he did. And then he ran away.   3. What was your first car? What happened to it?  The first car I owned was a 1983 Toyota Camry. Apparently the only year they made a lemon. When I traded it in for another car one of my friends asked me if it was hard to leave my first car behind. I laughed and said something like  Dang, I forgot to kick it before I walked away .   4. What was your first concert?  Does John Davidson at the Rodeo count? I was about seven or eight and I loovvveeeeddddd him. I think he had a game show or something at the time.  Did I just really date myself with John Davidson? Do you even know who he is?   5. How do you plan to spend your weekend?  May do the Saturday daytrip to Houston, but won't know until for sure tonight. Other than that, I have no plans. Whoo-hoo.
