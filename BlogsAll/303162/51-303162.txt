         Tonight was my second session with my therapist. I think I am going to break up with her. I've had therapy before. I know what I need. She's not it. She literally sits and looks at me until I talk. I told her tonight that I am reserved, have a had time talking about my feelings [I am so like a guy] ... that I need prompting, questions. She told me, "Well, I am all out of questions tonight." And then something like I need to be responsible for my growth.  Well, hell, if I could figure that out on my own I wouldn't be in therapy!!   Before that we looked at three houses. One has potential, but my inner voice is screaming out about the street it is on. The neighborhood I am primarily looking at is an older one. Lots of young families have moved back in and are renovating. This house, for example, is really cute, great landscaping, new kitchen, new bathroom ... very reasonably priced. It will go fast. However, the rest of the street has not caught up with that house. Most of the houses are well-kept, but a few others are not (i.e.: I have a problem with cars parked on the front lawn two doors down). So do I take the chance that more people will come to that street or get stuck in a not-so-great part of the neighborhood? Mostly I am disappointed because the one I really wanted to see is officially off the market to be a rental house. *sigh* It had real potential on a near perfect street...
