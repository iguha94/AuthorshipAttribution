         When I was a child, I had a security pillow. I carried that pillow with me everywhere.  Everywhere . My mom used to sneak it away from me to wash the pillow case or stick some additional stuffing (see, I used it as a pillow in addition to carrying it around).  I remember my first day of Kindergarten (almost 5-years-old) having someone ask me, "What's that?" I was dumbfounded that everyone didn't have one.   Eventually I worked up to leaving the pillow in the car during school days. Once, we had an accident and mom forgot to get the pillow out of the car before it went into the shop. I was so miserable ~ no substitute would appease me ~ that mom finally went to the garage to rescue my pillow.  When I was 13 (yes,  13 ! I grew up in a simpler era), my niece was born. I remember going into my mom's room late one night ~ after much debate and pondering ~ to tell her I'd decided that since the baby didn't need a pillow like mine, maybe I didn't either.  Flash Forward 23 years. Last year, I started to have the urge to sleep with a teddy bear. Perhaps I'd been single to long. Perhaps I needed to feel a sense of security in my life when things seemed to be falling apart.   I talked to my therapist about it and she said, "Who says we ever need to grow-up?" It really was in the midst of a lot of turmoil, so when I mentioned it to my mom, she ran out and found one for me ~ at a thrift store. It was huge. I tried it, it seemed to work. Then we visited a friend in Sugar Land and I rifled through her stash to borrow a bear for the night. Hers was just the right size.  That week ~ one year ago ~ I went out and bought Schlep (named thus by   Gund ).          I paid more than I would ever imagine paying for a stuffed animal. But, he still sleep with me every night. He travels when I travel (even to   London ). Do I feel like a dork at 37 and still sleeping with a teddy bear? No. Everyone needs a sense of security now and again. Especially now.
