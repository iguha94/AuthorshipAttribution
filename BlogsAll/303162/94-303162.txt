         Had a lovely visit with Howard and Pam yesterday. Alas, no sticky toffee pudding. The Christmas pudding was ok, but not quite the same. Howard looks fabulous considering all he's been through since I saw him three years ago. It sounds as if he leads a physically limited life, but he was quite cheeky and told us some funny stories (especially after his second glass of wine). Lee is a great conversationalist with strangers. I tend to be quite reserved around people I don't know well, even blood relatives. I think Howard is usually the same as me, but if I'd had a second glass of wine, I'd been a napping cousin!  I envy the travels Pam and Howard have taken ... between their world trips and short holidays, they've been nearly everywhere. I'd just love to have a world map like Howard's ~ with pushpins in all of the cities he's visited. I should have taken a picture, but I don't think a photo would do the map justice.  It was gorgeous yesterday, but cold and overcast today (with occasional sprinkles). I took a bus tour of the city. One of those hop-on hop-off guided tours. I love them. I took a break for a while and sat in a Starbucks (sorry Jeff) in Covent Gardens and watched the people go by. It made me think about how fulfilled I feel when I travel. We certainly haven't been doing the commando tourist thing, but just being here fills something in me that I can't quite explain.
