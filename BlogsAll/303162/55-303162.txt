          Lesson(s) of the day:    Be certain that any lovely neutral color [i.e.: "Whole Grain"] will go exactly where it should with minimal issues or splatters. Any bright color [i.e.: Essex Orange] will splatter, drip and spill regularly.  If you place your hand in the path of the moving blades of a ceiling fan and they make contact ... it will hurt. Might even break your skin and cause blood seepage.  If you paint with your mouth open ... you'll eventually get to taste it.   Guess what? We met every single goal for today. Really! Started about 9 a.m. and finished by 6:20 p.m. Girl Power! The orange room looks  fabulous .  I love it.    I started fashioning the tile in the kitchen and office. It is so nice to see something exactly the way I envisioned it.  The entertainment is together and awaiting a television set. Both rooms have two coats of paint. The electrician is putting together a bid.  All-in-all it was a pretty perfect day.  My friend Sandy came back today, and  she came to work . Man, I am so grateful for her help. Really, I'd still be reading the armoire/entertainment center directions. Better yet, if my friends hadn't come last night, I'd still be painting. I am so grateful to have so many women in my life who care for me and want to help. But tonight, I feel really lucky to have Sandy as my friend.  She brought her niece, Kristy, who was also a huge help. Later her kids came over and I took everyone out to dinner. It was the least I could do for all the free labor and guidance [this was my first paint attempt indoors]. We worked hard [Sandy more than some of us], but we had fun and laughed a lot too.  I feel strange knowing this is my last night in my apartment. While I am really excited about the house, I have loved this apartment. I will miss it ... for a few days anyway. Probably mostly for the free repair service ...
