         I've done  absolutely nothing  today. No unpacking, no shopping (except for a quick trip to the grocery store for some essentials) ... nothing. I have watched television and surfed the net. I think it's just one way for me to acclimate to the house.  Tomorrow, I  must  unpack all my clothes. It's just I hate my closet already. Yeah, I know I just got here. I'm thinking of widening the doorway to make it more accessible.  I think my mind is still sorting where things should go and what pieces I need to complete the place. I definitely need more storage space (it's an  old  house). At least I have an attic that I can throw things in (seasonal, Christmas tree, etc...). I just need some more of those plastic bins.   The former owners stopped by today to pick some items up from the garage. I think they really liked the color of the living room. Robin really liked the orange room (Chris and their daughter didn't seem so sure). She told me she was thinking about doing the black and white tile in their kitchen too.  It's just an interesting place to be in ... feeling like this place is not quite mine, and yet it is. Figuring out how to make it mine. To put my stamp on it. I've never really had a "style" before and now is my chance to find that place within myself. To let my personality show through. It's scary and exciting at the same time.
