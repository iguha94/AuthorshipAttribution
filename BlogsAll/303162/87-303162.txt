         So, how's the cleaning going, you ask.  The living room looks fabulous.  Totally  ready for company . And then, I got hungry. Decided I would go to Sonic for their new popcorn chicken and a cherry limeade. I come home and voila! The front door key snaps off in the lock.    Um, ok,  I think.  I'll just go to the back door . Alas, the key I need for the back door is now stuck in the front door.  Ok, I'll call mom . She's not home and her cellphone is turned off. As I stand there thinking, the Sonic bag falls off the car and deposits my chicken in the driveway.   Well, I have the paper,  I think.  I'll read it and try mom again in a while.  I finish the paper. Try mom. Nothing. I lay in the backseat and try for a nap (the doors were locked and I was in my driveway). Try mom again. Yea! She's turned on her cellphone. Boo! She's with my brother. I explain the situation and tell her no,  they  can't come over and I'll wait until they leave.   So I do. In my car. In my driveway. I call a friend. She entertains me for a while. Well, she's getting a divorce, so I really shouldn't call it entertainment. I'm sure you're thinking. "Wait. You have your keys, you have your purse. Go somewhere." Um, yeah. I was  cleaning . My hair is pulled back with clips, I have on sweats and a t-shirt that says:     Good boys go to Heaven.  Bad boys go to Susan's Room.   So yeah, not hitting Barnes & Noble in that lovely ensemble. Hell, having to get the keys from my mom while wearing that t-shirt was enough.   Finally  three hours  into my waiting game, mom calls to tell me they have left. First thing I do when I get to her house is hit the bathroom (it was a Route 44 cherry limeade!)  And do I feel like cleaning now?   Nah ...
