         What a day. A flurry of paperwork on the house. My loan guy recommended locking in today because he expects the rate to go up any minute now. Then like 4 p.m., it occurs to me,  Oh, I'm supposed to be calling about insurance!   Then I talked to my lovely real estate agent Sue, and she volunteered to help make some calls for me tomorrow. What a woman!  This morning I talked with my boss about the "D" word.  I don't feel like my work has been up to par and have really felt it's been noticeable lately. Today was my regularly scheduled bi-monthly meeting and when I walked in she asked, "So, are you going crazy?" I laughed and said,  It's funny you should ask that today ...  I explained the depression, meds and therapy [my therapist and I walked through this yesterday]. She was really great about it. She told me, "Well things make more sense now. You have not the been the same person you were even six months ago." She told me that she understands a lot about depression. That even with medication you aren't better "tomorrow." I told her that I thought within a few months I would be closer to my old self, but for now I'm just not multi-tasking very well. She didn't take any work away from me [the BIG project ends next week], but I feel like I have a safety net now.
