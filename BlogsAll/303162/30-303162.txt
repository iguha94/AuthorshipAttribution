         I got a new CD today,  ... all this time  by   Sting . I bought it at   half.com  for seven bucks. It's in perfect condition. If you haven't tried buying or selling at half.com, I really encourage you to give it a try (really, I get no kickback for this endorsement).  It's a nice Jazz-fusion of some of Sting's greatest hits,  A Thousand Years, Roxanne, Brand New Day, Every Breath You Take  and more. The real kicker for me is:   Fragile  If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one Drying in the colour of the evening sun Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away But something in our minds will always stay  Perhaps this final act was meant To clinch a lifetime's argument That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could For all those born beneath an angry star Lest we forget how fragile we are  On and on the rain will fall Like tears from a star, like tears from a star On and on the rain will say How fragile we are, how fragile we are  On and on the rain will fall Like tears from a star, like tears from a star On and on the rain will say How fragile we are, how fragile we are How fragile we are, how fragile we are     Fragile  and the  ... all this time  CD were recorded on  September 11, 2001 . Now, read the lyrics again.
