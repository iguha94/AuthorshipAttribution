                 I &hearts;   David Robinson .  Tonight was our hometown   Tribute to David Robinson . It would be easy to sit here and list his on-the-court stats and awards. There are  so many .   Trust me, the list will surprise you .   But really, it's his character, principles, faith, integrity and class that he lives by off-the-court that are his greatest tribute. I met David once. I found him to be gracious, self-deprecating and generous with his time. A true gentleman. His philanthropic causes run deep in our city. I am proud that he has chosen to continue his post-career life in San Antonio.  And you can see how his best qualities influence our team. They are a fine group of men who live simple lives in our quiet community.  It was something to watch grown men [teammates] wipe away tears as they spoke of him earlier. And when they said, "I love you," it wasn't in the beer commercial "I love you man" tease. Other teams may respect each other as teammates. Some, I think, only tolerate each other. Tonight, you could   feel   their genuine affection for each other.  Sure, we may be the milk-and-cookies team of the league. But with the values our players live by in this community ~ on and off the court ~  I wouldn't have it any other way.  I'll miss you Admiral.
