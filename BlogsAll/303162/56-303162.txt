         Tomorrow morning at 9 a.m., I take official ownership of my house ~~ I get the keys!!  Go me!   Tonight I bought the paint for my living room and office. The living room color is a nice neutral (that peach has got to go) and I chose bright orange for the office. Yes, orange. See, I was at one of many paint places and one name just jumped right out at me: Essex Orange. How could I pass that up?   I'm expecting 6-7 helpers tomorrow night. I promised to ply them with pizza, cookies and beverages. I hope with that many people it won't take too long. Then I am taking off Friday to put together the "entertainment center" ~~ after I wrestle it back into my car (this time I am going to open up the box and move it piece by piece).   On Saturday, a local non-profit is coming by to pick up my donations: TV set (large console ~~ color not too hot, but it works), microwave (20-years old, too old to sell), a mini stereo, clothes, a wall hanging, small indoor grill (George Forman works better) and other miscellaneous items,  Then I am going to buy a new TV, so the movers can pull it out of my trunk and place it in the newly built "entertainment center" (God willing it stays up). By Saturday night, I'll be sleeping in  my  home ...  I haven't gotten some of the things done I wanted to do before moving in. I figure it's Murphy's Law and have elected to roll with the punches. I am meeting the construction guy again tomorrow so he can re-measure the house for insulation. I think he measured wrong (about $1,000 wrong). We'll see.  I'll try to document the process for my Yahoo photo album ...
