          The recap : My movie came on at 1 p.m. Mom came over at 3 p.m. and we exchanged gifts. We ate dinner about 6:15 p.m. It was pretty pleasant. My Godmother was really off. I fixed her plate for her and helped her open gifts. Made sure everything stayed together. She and my Godfather gave me a beautiful sapphire and diamond bracelet. Gina told me that "he was so proud of what he picked out for you." It's really lovely and makes me feel ashamed that I don't have tolerance for him.  About 8 p.m., Sandy called to tell me know my Godson was looking for me. I pushed mom so that we could leave and in the end got to spend about an hour with them. "Them" being the bulk of her family. They've been like my sub-family for 25 years. Good God. I can't be that old!  Antonio brought me my gift as soon as I got there. He picks the gifts out for me and had selected about a two-foot tall candle holder with a nice smelling candle. Sandy told me, "He thinks that's the color you should paint the entertainment center." It   is   a nice shade ... I got a couple of oohs and ahhs over his gifts, which is always a bonus. Plus we played Gina's game, which for ages 8 and older was tough for two 37-year-olds to figure out!  In all, it really was a nice day. I have so many things to be grateful for this year. I feel blessed to have the life that I have. Really, it was just that one whiney moment, I swear.
