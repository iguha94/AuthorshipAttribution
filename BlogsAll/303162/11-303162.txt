         Whoo-hoo! We made it! Three full days of treatment successfully completed!  Mom felt fine all day. She had a little bout of nausea when she sat in the chair, but her pre-meds took care of that and she made it through treatment.  We had birthday cake (what can I say, everyone likes chocolate cake for breakfast!), and got out in about 90 minutes.  I think it was good for her spirits to have the whole room wishing her happy birthday (and it was a full house today). Even Dr. Kalter stopped by. She seems happy. Perhaps relieved that she made it. Even commented that if she does this again, they can leave the needle in all three days. We're talking major leaps and bounds here!  This evening we paid off the remainder of our trip to NYC. Had dinner at Beto's, visited the Japanese Tea Gardens (hey, it's her birthday, not mine) and agreed that it had a pretty good day.  As I walked into the office this morning I was thinking about this process and how I feel I have changed. Yeah, yeah, I know it's her cancer, but it's about me too.  I feel more compassionate. More apt to help a stranger. Quicker to chide myself for being judgemental of the person in the car ahead of me. Snippy comments at work just pass right by. It's not a reality check I recommend for everyone, but it proves there is more to life than the petty stuff I used to worry or get angry about. Coupled with 9-11, I just feel different. A good different.
