         alright, i've gone back with this template. It has the predone links thingies and i'm lazy, so its perfect. i will probably change the colors.   Damn, i've been listening to Grand Champeen.. great stuff. I get into funks where i think i'll never find any music again that feels fresh, makes me feel good, etc, and i'm always wrong. in the past, i found the misfits, janes addiction, dinosaur jr, and then there was nothing, absolutely nothing, for almost six years, then i found big sugar, the deftones, big chief, therapy? now grand champeen. I was on a Cream kick for a LONG time, being too young to have heard much of them (was 26 when i discovered "fresh cream" and just learning how to play the bass). Cream still freakin rules, and jack bruce is still making amazing music. Wish i could say the same thing for Clapton.   today i got some piccies back, some from the first gig the band did together a few weeks ago.  here's what happens when you hand a drunk a camera- you get a lot of pictures back of people you don't know, and none of the band. no prob. i couldn't get the second roll loaded, so nothing on it came out. One came out of me and tammi, but that's about it.   need  more   film  one of my cats is totally demented. She used to bring me dried leaves. Now, i think she's peeling roof moss off the roof and bringing it in. I keep finding huge blobs of it in the hallway. What the.... ?  uninteresting day, mostly. got some terracotta pots to replant some of my herbie plants, and some dirt, and then took dale up to the tavern for lunch. Mass wonderfood there, for sure. mary roolz.   don't look at the links.. cos i have to fix them. maybe tomorrow.  cripes, i logged in today to show dale the template thingie, and there were so many people on i kept getting 503 messages. (server too busy). So hey, y'all, fuck off, i wanna update MINE.
