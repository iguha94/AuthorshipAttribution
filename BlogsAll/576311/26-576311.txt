         but anyway, i sent it out.  Probably three weeks later i got this fat manila envelope back from them with all my shit in it and comments from all their staff. Not a single nice one. Ooh man they ripped me a new one. But without good reason, i think. It really upset me.  one wrote, "Get away from the computer and use a pen".   I thought that was very funny. I was thinking, and i wrote back about this one comment, but i was thinking "Man, i've written shit in my own blood with a gun to my head..maybe that's more like something a poet would do" (sarcasm dripping from my teeth). But i had done similar things at that time, i mean writing this crazy shit as a means to not act on it physically.   I've had those little outlets for a long time. I didn't always use them when i should have, but i think i'm most creative when i'm in one of my  X-treme ends of the feelings spectrum. For some reason if i'm on an even keel, i don't write well. Or draw.   I guess a lot of that has to do with not knowing what to do with feelings. Or maybe not. Who knows.   I just know i desperately want to write over the last few months and haven't been able to work myself into the destructive frenzy that i need to do it well.
