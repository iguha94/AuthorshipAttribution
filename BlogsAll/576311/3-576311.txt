          More fun than shootin fish in a barrel   Hoooey.  Just got back.  Here's  my  personal review:   ML  (just picture me tooting my horn, or greasing my head to leave because it was too big to squeeze through the door)  Silverhawk  As usual, fan-fucking-tastic.    Avogadro's Number  Ooh.  FINALLY got to see these guys, and now i know what all the hoo-hah was about.  Dude makes me wanna put my bass away and cry.  (as if... I will torture people with my playing as long as i have fingers).    Muffalo  I think they only played three songs? But they were three damn cool ones.    Black Chrome vs. Death Mask  Had no clue what to expect from these dudes, but it wasn't disappointing.    Zero Set  They cancelled.  I was bummed.  I wanted to see them.    DJ Josh McGrady  Last, and certainly  not  least, the man played some seriously rad shit, and i'd hire him in a sheep's eye if i ever needed a DJ.  Tomo took what looked like tons of pictures and is going to put them on Avagadro's Numbers web page, so when they're up i'll link to them.    There were a lot of really great costumes, too! There are probably a lot of pictures of those, too.   So, it was a rad show.  I hope we get to do more stuff like that.  We were the odd ones in that we played covers and everyone else has originals... but, hey man, our covers are cooooool.  thbbbbbt. (i was kinda self-concious about that. Erm, i'm an idiot though and can be self-concious about some stupid shit)  And Dale got to hang around and see us! *Smooch*  He didn't get to run the board for us, but it was nice that he got to come see us, since he usually has to work on the nights we play.     Next Weekend:   Saturday 11/2 we're off to rattle some glassware at Tad's in fabulous downtown    Coquille
