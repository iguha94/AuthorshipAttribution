         So, after all that, i guess what i'm trying to say, dammit, is that i feel like i'm drowning right now.  That terrible feeling of pointlessness that leads me to consume entire bottles of liquor and inadvertently distance myself from people.  Not the terrible grey void i feel in the wintertime, but just as disturbing, with the potential to probably go that way if i let it, which i can't.  Because i get self-destructive.  And that is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, BAD.    And, no, i will probably not come on here and unload my problems.  That's just stuff i don't think the world needs to be aware of.    I unloaded a good deal at practice tonight, even though i felt listless and frustrated.  We jammed a good bit of an original song tonight that we hadn't ever done before.  Then we looked at the set list and thought, Man, we're all gettin so sick of some of those fucking songs, we don't even want to practice them anymore.  Hows that for the attention span of a common housefly?! Five months and we're ready to dump half our set because we're bored with it.   Er, sorry, that was a bit dropping off the dump truck (picks up the trash and tosses it back in the truck).  We'll have that dealt with in short order.  Indeed.
