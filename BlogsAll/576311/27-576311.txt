         Frozen Moment: (In which April loses the car, the keys, and her boots)  I went to some fair in  Hermosa Beach  with Capn Crusty and it must have been John Hamm. We ate pizza and then drank large pitchers of beer. Many of them. We all got separated. I couldn't find my boots. Or my car. Or my keys.   I had Michelle's phone number, though. Made her and.. i think her middle brother? come all the way out from Gardena to save my pathetic, drunk ass.   This may have been the same time i ran into Michelle "Piece" Yacoupian. She was at a booth selling incense. I was sooo happy to see her, but too drunk to realize how fortunate i was to see her. That was the last time i ever saw her. I guess she's doing good now, has a kid and got married. I hope she's happy. I've heard from a lot of the rest of the crowd i used to hang out with, and i hope we're all happy, cos we freakin ALL deserve to be. My tale seems the "easiest" of times in the last 10 years after hearing about some of theirs, but mine sure wasn't the "easiest" when it was at its most insane.   In AZ one time, when i was doing a lot of writing and sort of dancing around the fringe of this arty kinda crowd, i was encouraged to submit some of my writing to a local poetry 'zine. We'll call it South Ash Press. I had relatively high respect for this thing until i actually submitted something to them.  First, they ask all of their submisions be typed. So i took my books of scrawl and typed out maybe four poems and submitted them. I think my query letter had some kinda attitude about it.. maybe i had submitted something before and they didn't even bother to send a rejection letter...
