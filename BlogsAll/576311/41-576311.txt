         tonight we were supposed to pratice, but it ended up a "listen to one person and their fantasies" for 4 hours kinda night. It started out nice, kinda warm out, some clouds out.  I got to the band house and Nick said he felt sick and wasn't sure if he wanted to practice. Ok. no prob. if you're sick, you're sick. So tam and i went to Chebron and bought some stuff to drink and when we were walking back noticed lightning off to the southeast. Lots of it. TONS of it. it was awesome. it was far enough away that there was no thunder.  I hadn't seen a good lightning storm since i moved up here.  But i hung out in the GMS lot and watched it for about an hour, and then it started getting windy, so i went back in. It hasn't rained yet, though.  Every flash showed huge sheets of rain laden clouds.  It was, once again, fucking awesome. I got a sort of adjustment.   Then we went in and the thing with being blabbered at incessantly went on for awhile, and my pants were too tight, so i was uncomfurry. hehe. Tam gave me a pair of pseudo-camos i've been coveting, to wear instead, but i have to give them back, which sucks, because they're WAY comfy.   I'm at the point where i just want this thing on the 19th to be over with. I'm so fucking sick of hearing about it all the freakin time. Yeah! It's a "big" show for us! Yeah! It's an audtion for a bigger one! Yea! Stuff may go wrong! Shut up and play fer peets sake.   Sweartagod, i'm getting a shirt with that on it, and i'm going to wear it all the damn time.
