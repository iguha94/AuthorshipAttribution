         Band practice today!  Also changed the obnoxious color of the page. I couldn't look at the yellow anymore. Soon, i hope to replace the rocks with pictures of each of us.   Possible leads for us: Lloyd's of Bandon  IS  interested in us.                                  The band at the Blue Moon wants a break, so i hear.                                  New owner at the Homestead.                                 Jeef has talked to the people at the Fun Fest and the Gay 90s festival. I'm supposed to handle the rest (of course)                                 We can go up and play any old time at Mary's.   If you know any of these places, or frequent them, blab about us.
