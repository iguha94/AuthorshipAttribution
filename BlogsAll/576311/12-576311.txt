         Check out that Life in Armenia link. Very cool one. There's another one here that makes me wish i could read Farsi, just so i could see what it says.   I've been invited to tell the tale of how and why i joined TCFX on a guitar players site, Guitarnoise.com. That's a great site, though, so check it out.   TCFX stands for Too Cool For Chris. Chris was the main thing keeping me from joining these guys a year ago. It started because there is this maroon 84 Camaro roaming around town, with pink and sky blue pinstripes, and its so cheesy looking, and on the rear spoiler fin it says "Too Cool 4 U" or something. I freakin laugh every time i see it. Prime example of the Oregon genus of Dorkus Maximus. Somehow, though, Tam and i thought it was a killer band name.   TC4X?   We're going to do Fortunate Son. Its been an obsession of mine ever since i started playing music, that some day i would be in a band and we would do Fortunate Son. the irony would be lost if there was a male singer. We have a female singer. And on top of that, the song just seems to fit the times. Kinda like, just after we started bombing Afghanistan, we jammed on Universal Soldier up at the tavern one night.   Never understood the "need" to play a certain song. My friend Mike (now Mike Odd of Rosemary's Billygoat) was obsessed with playing "Earache My Eye" when we were in High School. He got to, on his first album "Pizza of Doom". Check them out. But anyway, i understand now.
