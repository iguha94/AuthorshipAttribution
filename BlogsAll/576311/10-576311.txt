Another case i remember being bombarded with when i was growing up, this one while i was in middle school.  The Laurel Canyon murders as they were known at the time, The Wonderland murders as they seem to have morphed into.  I was about 11... i had no idea who John Holmes was, y'know? "Adult film star" didn't have much meaning, either.   I watched Wonderland last night.  Ok i rented it cos it's a Val Kilmer movie! So kill me.  But it was trippy.  He did a good job as a lying, sniveling piece of shit basefiend.  And i've known enough of them in my time to know exactly what sort of subhumans they are.  Which brings an interesting thing up.  At times in the movie, you feel profoundly sorry for the Holmes character.  I mean, you go, "jeez, dude, if you could only see yourself".  Other times, you wonder how someone like that managed to stay alive long enough to be such a sheister.  You could kill him yourself for showing his weasely face.   So now i have a little more understanding of that particular LA murder case, and the Onion Field one.  I have no real desire to learn anything more about the OJ one.   My homesickness seems to manifest itself by the need to watch movies filmed in or about Los Angeles and the psychos, freaks and weirdness that have inhabited its landscape for the past 100 years.   Someday, i'll get back there.  Til then i continue my love/hate relationship with it from Oregon.                 </post>
