         i've had this song stuck in my head all day. I've had the Jane's Addiction version stuck. I'm listenin to it right now, too...  ARTIST: Rolling Stones TITLE: Sympathy for the Devil    Yow! Yow! Yow!  Please allow me to introduce myself I'm a man of wealth and taste I've been around for a long, long year Stole many a man's soul and faith  And I was 'round when Jesus Christ Had His moment of doubt and pain Made damn sure that Pilate Washed his hands and sealed His fate  {Refrain} Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game  Stuck around St. Petersberg When I saw it was a time for a change Killed the Czar and his ministers Anastasia screamed in vain I rode a tank, held a general's rank When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank  {Refrain}  I watched the gleam while your kings and queens   Ooh ooh, ooh ooh Fought for ten decades for the Gods they made   Ooh ooh, ooh ooh I shouted out, who killed the Kennedys   Ooh ooh, ooh ooh When after all, it was you and me   Ooh ooh, ooh ooh  {Ooh ooh's continue throughout}  Let me please introduce myself I'm a man of wealth and taste And I lay traps for troubadors Who get killed before they reached Bombay  {Refrain}  Oh yeah, get down, hit it  Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah But what's confusing you is just the nature of my game  Just as every cop is a criminal And all the sinners saints As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer 'Cause I'm in need of some restraint  So if you meet me, have some courtesy Have some sympathy, and some taste Use all your well learned politesse Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah  {Refrain}  Mm mean it, get down  Tell me baby, what's my name Tell me honey, can you guess my name Tell me baby, what's my name I tell you one time, you're to blame  Ooh hoo, ooh hoo, ooh hoo, all right What's my name Tell me, baby, what's my name Tell me, sweetie, what's my name Ooh hoo, ooh hoo, ooh hoo, all right
