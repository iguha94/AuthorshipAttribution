           Wallace & Gromit Films   ahhh...   First saw W&G in "Grand Day Out" at an animation fest somewhere.. might have been santa monica, who knows.... before i split for nashville.  1990? 1989? I worked in the defense industry, if you can believe it, making parts for missiles.   But before then i had seen his work on PBS one early ,early, morning on some weird show that had the acid pits in the CA desert and some near flooded town on the Salton Sea... but i saw his thing where they were interviewing zoo animals... damn, i can't remember what its was called, but it was probably six months before i saw the animation festival.  That particular period is quite blurry.  I lived in one of four places, all in Pedro.  I may have known Michelle by then, maybe not.  I knew Scott (Aicher), but we may have still been friends or may have started suffering from his "girls and guys can't be friends neurosis", which ended with me shoving him into a jacuzzi at a party when i was real drunk, and that party may or may not have been the one i saw the offspring at...but i'm pretty sure it was at the same house.  I believe i was working at Lunada Bay Unocal then, and that was before it became a Mobile station (And i worked there when it was a Mobil station, too) and now its a Texaco.  That was before i started smoking crack, so it was a  good  time.  Did i have the Galaxie? The Suzuki GS 400? The toyota corolla? Terry and i were still friends, Val and i were not.  Christian and i had parted ways over the Greg and Albert scene at 7-11.  Was it before or after i gave Ian his tattoo while we were both drunk on tequila?!   Man... oh man... So, it was before Nashville.. probably either just before the Gulf War or during, most likely before.
