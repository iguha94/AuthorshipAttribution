         i was looking through some webpages of synesthetes.  I hate how they call it "syn".  It seems to cheapen the experience.  Whatever.  A lot of them have their "color charts" out.  Cool.  I'm not going to go through all that hassle, but i will do some explaining.    As i mentioned, for me its sounds/colors.  Some sounds have shapes.  Some phrases have  scenes  attached to them, but i won't go that far with it yet.  For now, just the musical notes.     A  is mahogany.  Almost maroon.  But woodier.  The Ab is a duller hue, A# is more bright. An A minor chord is primarily mahogany, with some velvety maroon and threads of gold.    B  Deep, dark blue.  Bb is off-white, though.  A B chord is like the deep ocean colored.  It's always a very round sound, too.  C  Mustardy. Like French's mustard.  C# is slightly brighter.  Cb has more orange.   D  Green. A leafy, healthy green.  Like a fern.  Variations on the D chord (Dsus, Dmaj, Dmin) are shades of green.  Dsus4 is green like a spruce tree with silvery bits.    E  is brown.  Like chocolate. An Eminor chord has a reddish tint, but still brown.   F  Close to B.  Darker, probably could call it indigo.  Has hidden purple shimmers that come out when it's made into chords.  G  G is hard to pin down.  It's a olive-y, brownish, loamy color.
