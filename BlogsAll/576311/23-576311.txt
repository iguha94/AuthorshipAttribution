         MmM Andy Cairns brain is so intriguing sometimes.   Tightrope walker   I'm tryin' to walk up the stairs  My hands are snatchin' at the slivers of light  I'm stickin' to the steps  Each one a release from the place below  I'm on a mission  On the hunt for clean, clear vapour skies  'cos I'm choking on my own, I need some air   The dark skies behind me  Begging you to scrape off your disco paint  It's open to the night  And I'm sick as a hospital and empty factories  You look so tiny, so very unimportant  I'm nearly there and everything feels fine   Don't wanna look behind me  Don't wanna look beneath me  Every movement, every vibration  Every movement, every vibration   High above piss city  Watch the pigs-ear people, all dead in their droves  Some shuffle in silence  Some gorge sucking on silicone  I've got the urge to jump  Watch my life whizz by, fast forward flash  But hold on boy, I feel alive   Don't want to look behind me  Don't want to look beneath me  Every movement, every vibration  Every movement, every vibration   Don't want to look behind me  Don't want to look beneath me  Every movement, every vibration  Every movement, every vibration   Don't want to look behind me  Don't want to look beneath me  Every movement, every vibration  Every movement, every vibration
