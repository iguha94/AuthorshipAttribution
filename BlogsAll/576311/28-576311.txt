         This town is too damn small. I wish my drummer would realize that. And keep his mouth shut to bar owners about how GRAND we are. Because there ARE bands better than us, and that kind of talking comes back to bite you in the ass, always, especially here. No one can afford to go talking shit about any other band. cripes. fer fuck's sake and all. Check this out, he blabs to a club owner, while a band is playing. I know the band. i don't know the club owner, but someone else i know knows the club owner.  So this someone else tells me what the club owner told her the drummer said. Not only do i know the band, on a kind of small-talk hey nice to see you sound great kinda level, but THEIR drummers dad teaches bass at the college, was my teacher. *smacks face, drags hand down chin, going aaaaaagh*. Yknow, there's a time to shine, and that's onstage, not standing around bad-mouthing the competetion. So, there's probably only a small chance we'll ever get to play there, which is why i think i may go down to this club over the weekend and say hi to this guy and maybe smooth it out, if it's smoothable. I'm not sure what he's expecting. we've only been together as a band for hmm maybe three months. i still haven't got all the songs i learned in that three months totally nailed down yet. (well, you pack in 30 songs in 60 days and see how much you retain, ok?)   There is, however, one place in town i simply will not ever play. If they want to play there, they do it without me, because i've taken so much shit from the owner of the place i'm just not going to play in her shithole.
