            The World Newspaper    This is the local "newspaper". It's a fucking joke. About six months after i moved here, they got a new editor, and i stopped seeing the typos and  spelling mistakes  all the time. The paper centered itself, politically, which was nice.  About another six months later, the mistakes started popping up again, the letters to the editor were all about god, and we ALL OF THE SUDDEN had a serious drug problem here. They got a new editor. One who thinks throwing god at any problem, like some people think throwing enough cash at a problem, will do the trick. It might as well be a church newsletter with a BIG sports section and only the shortest, tersest articles about what happens on this hurtling rock we call home.   I once sent them an email, and asked if they had a proofreader on staff, and if they did, did this person actually proofread or just stare at the layout for 20 minutes and call it done. They answered that they didn't have an official proofreader, but everyone at the paper was responsible for proofing. Well, that splains it then. They all need remedial english classes.  I see mistakes in the paper that no self-respecting sixth grader would make.    And two of my friends work there. From what they tell me, it sounds like a bigger gossip cesspool than anywhere else i've ever been, with one fatass blonde in particular having a mouth that never shuts up. People thinking they're big fish or something, it's almost funny, if it wasn't so pathetic.
