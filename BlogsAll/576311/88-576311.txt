          help meeeeeee   no, i don't personally need the help (well, unless you want to send money, in which case, drop me a note and we'll negotiate ;)).  I'm going to go on about insecure people online.    No matter what kind of site or group it is, there are always a few people who must have certain information step-by-step, or need their hand held through the process of choosing strings, wood, resin, spells, incense, whatthefuckever.  I dont know if they are incapable of experimentation, lazy, stupid, codependent, immature or what, but they're always there.  They clog the group boards on yahoo with demands for details any idiot could figure out on their own.  They clog the boards at PSW wondering what the red freakin buttons are for and what page of the manual has certain info.  they clog the boards (repeatedly!) at Active Bass with the dumbest shit you could think of pertaining to playing, buying, selling or learning bass stuff.    nah, it's hardly a new phenomenon, i know.  It just seems to be getting worse.  Maybe, or maybe not.  I'm not a hand holder.  i firmly believe in common sense and experiencing something for the experience.  If you need a goddamn manual for turning on your amp, either you're an idiot or your amp is just too complicated for you and you should go back to pumping gas, or whatever, maybe take up the drums or something.  (Then of course, you clog the drummer sites with stuff like "My foot hurts when i double pedal on this song, WHY?")  Maybe people think the internet is a magic wand.  a lot of people have no clue how to use a search engine.  They can code crap like MySql all day long but have no idea how to use google.    Rant's done.  Only half serious, of course.  Or am I? muahahaah
