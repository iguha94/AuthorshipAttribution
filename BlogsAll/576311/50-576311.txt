         Had a fabalus jam tonight.  I sang diane, the best yet, with the dudes.  then we played sunshine of your love.  Then i took the drums away from spike an he played bass and we did a jam that i just kinda played real simple on, and then we did red house, which i went bananers on.  its funny to watch someone who can only barely play an instrument go bananas on it, i'm sure.  But that's why i love the dudes.  I can be a total idiot the whole time i'm there and they're happy as long as i'm doing SOMETHIN.   take that, Billaaaaaay!  Tammis gonna work on jammin electric guitar.  That'll be rad.  She wants to do some rhythm playing.  We're gonna rock so damn FUGLY hard when she gets it down.  We'll be the loudest, tightest, in your facest band in the county.  NYAH! Hey man, gotta have goals... gawd that's just gonna be the shit. four piece band with a rhythm player/singer, lead player, bassist/singer and drummer.  can't beat that with a day-old salami.   funny part now about me kinda branchin into singing and drumming up there, it's a sort of well kept secret.  By the time i get to do it, the place has emptied out and we're down to like 7 people. pretty much always the same 7, too. so, even the people who know i play, and have watched me play for the last six years, they don't know about it either.  hehe.  can't wait to spring it on them at some point.  hey i can play bloodhound gang's fire water burn on the drums and sing it. i'll have to bust that out on the band one day.  they'll die.  rofl.
