         Have any of you chicks been clothes shopping lately?? I mean  new clothes...I don't do that alot, I'm a thrift store momma, as are the few females I allow near me. But anyways, every once in a while, a girl needs a new pair of pants-not just any pants, but some brand new Levi's ect, something that  fits  nicely....   So what's the deal with the skank~show faded streaks/front thigh wrinkles...I especially  hate the ass fade-horshoe thing. I think that if I wanted to look like a bulimic party orifice, I would, well,  be  one.   heh heh heh...strike one 'gainst the Bimbi...well, look out you over-maintained pretentios 'ho's, cause I saw something that will chill your little artificial hearts. . .    Out of desperation, I ventured over to the, well, call it the minivan mom section, I guess, in hopes of escaping the slutfade.  Guess what? Thats right, it's finally been long enough that They're starting to don slutfade wear too.  And  the dangly scarfy belts etc...I'm really pissed about the belts, cause I've always worn those, I like the look, but now I must abstain, as the party ho's have appropriated it....Owell.  The minivan moms will swiftly make them uncool again. Then it's just a matter of time, so hold on to your belts out there O wimmen of class! Well, at last I scored a skirt y'all should dig, with minimum fades on it (its a long denim fitted thing) that I may or may not dye over.  Nick likes it the way it is...........(.!!dudes!!)  But then again, he likes me the way I is, so there's no question he has impeccable judgement! That's the end of the latest adventure, see y'all around!!!!!
