Ok well it's been like a month since Nth of Pril went down the tubes.  In the meantime, i've been entertaining myself til it hurts.         Tam and i have spent a total of about 12 hours in the luxury yacht. (that's canoe to you city folks).  It shows.           I missed the cardboard boat races.  Was just too lazy to go outside.           It got warmish here. Some might say hot, but the worst part wasn't the hot, it was the humid.  Then we got slapped with hurricane force winds.  Typical.           Tam and I invented and worked on a setlist for our new project, T&A Productions Co, Inc, LLC, Etc.  A veritable entertainment conglomerate. You'll see.           The Wyrd one and I have plotted and schemed, but the world is still not our oyster.  Don't worry, you'll soon be on the BBQ, floating in butter-garlic-tobasco-parmesan sauce.              Greatest garage sale find in years...   "Asterix bei der Schweizen" .  For a dollah! For Dale and I, reading this is like being five years old and being given a big book full of big words.  We both excelled at German in high school, but having not used it regularly in a good 10 years or so, even a basic comic book is a slog.  Good stuff, though.
