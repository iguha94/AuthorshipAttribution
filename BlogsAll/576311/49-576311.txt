           Parent permission initiative challenged     Read the last line in this article.  Backers of the initiative said it's aimed at maintaining parents' authority .  Shut the fuck up and go back to church. I think kids have enough problems without this implied left-field smack at other peoples parenting skills.  Stuff happens.  Kids need to know how to deal with it, and this certainly isn't going to help them.   Every election, we get all these dumbass ballot measures to help regulate and legislate everything we do in Oregon.  I like the idea that the average joe can get something on the ballot, but it never seems to be the average joe anymore.  it's these self-appointed moral police groups shoving their agendas on everyone else.  I'm about sick to death of other people deciding for me what i can do, what my friends kids can do, and blah blah blah.    Oh.  I got the text of the new ruling put forth by the OLCC about minor entertainers in places where alcohol is served. It's going to take me a couple of days to wade through it and get a grip on what it says, but on a cursory glance, i'd say the ACLU has a good chance of fending it off.   I may go ahead and post the whole thing here. it's some three pages long.   By the way, i had to ask for the ruling to be sent to me.  They don't yet have an online copy of it, and my local OLCC office is full of slackards who go home at noon.
