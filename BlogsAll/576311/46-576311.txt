          Thing that is driving me insane, Number 3,102   A stupid bass solo. See, i'm trying to work one out for Diane, because it's an easy song, and even if i laid down two measures of solo along with nick in the solo bit of the song, it wouldn't be so busy as to detract from the song.  i have to get with nick on both of these, but this is what i'm thinking.  (* why the hell isn't this on the band page?!  because it isn't BAND STUFF dammit  . It's April stuff*)  Anyway, onward.    Idea one.  And this would be the one that's doing the driving insane, and the other one must just be a passenger... i want to run a walkdown under the solo.  Not just some bluesy thing, cos it isn't a blues song.  I can't figure out where to begin the damn thing.  Nothing sounds good.  Idea two.  which i REALLY need to sit down with nick and work out, or it won't work at all.  If nick kept his solo moving from the low end of the neck and worked it up to the higher parts, i could take it the opposite way and i think that would nicely capture the feeling of the song.    This is retarded. Agonizing over this. I can't believe it. *slap slap slap*. Oh, fer peet's saaaaaaake.   And shit. i hafta walk down to get some smokes, and i think it's raining?  Saw Sara and blaze yesterday.  Sara and shaun bought a house.  Why she's still with the guy, i have no idea.  I'd have beaten him to a bloody, reeking of cheap beer pulp by now.
