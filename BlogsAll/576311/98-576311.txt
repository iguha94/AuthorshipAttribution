         um, DAMN i had something to say and i forgot it.   (deep beep diddly bop bop beedloo beedloo skiboop boop blip)  um  (bop bop boowop duhdip dip dip dooo waaa)   um.   wtf?   It was good.. i swear.. really.  here's the back part of my day:   Went to the paper to give Sara a ride home cos her car is pooped out right now.  While there, we find out that Joan's truck has also done something weird (i think its a bad coil wire).  So i'm standin there, tryin to prove my point about the coil wire to a guy who thinks i'm talking about the spark plug wires (um, no, dya think i'm a fuckin moron, dude?) and i hear a Screeeeee! Crashbang! from around the corner.  I figured, hey, add some excitement.. out in front of the paper, a car wreck.. woowoo i'm gonna go look.  So i go, and a crummy has hit a little blue car, just tagged its front corner.  And .... i see a small person with a big mass of black hair... and... i realize its Mary... and Mary has been sort of a basketcase lately, so i run over to see if she needs any help.  She does.  She's okay, but she's never been in an accident and isn't sure what to do.  So i help her out.  Poor thing.  My poor Mary! Gawd, i wish i could get through to that woman.  Love her to death, though.  Need to get her a Teddy Bear, i think.  She's been doing real well with the runes i made her though. She's one of those people who, when first shown the runes, takes an immediate liking to them, so i made her some with river stones and india ink and gave her my old Blum book on them.  (i need a new one now, but havent gotten around to it yet).    well, there was something else.  i just can't remember it.  So there's that.
