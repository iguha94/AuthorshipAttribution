         gah, i don't want to come across as some foaming christian-hater.  Because i don't hate them.  I often mistrust some of their motives.  I've been flagrantly, personally insulted by some of them in public places. Speaking to some of them is often like beating on a wall, or listening to a scratched record.  Some of them  openly discriminate against people who aren't "like them".  But some of them are (i think) excellent examples of their faith, adhering to the "jesus said love your neighbor, so i do" school of thought.  The only time you even get an inkling that they might be christian is after they give you a ride home in the rain and say "Good night! Jesus loves you!".  These people truly believe we are all God's children, and i appreciate that more than having someone else tell me God hates me for not acknowledging his book as The Truth.  These people, i feel, are the ones who truly "get" the teachings of Jesus.    that's not to say, of course, that i think they are the ONLY christians.  If someone says they're christian, that's cool with me, and i don't much care which splinter they come from, as long as it isn't being poked into my flesh.  I can't say who is and who isn't.  That isn't up to me at all.     I even sometimes wonder "what would jesus do?", but more like "What would i do if i were Jesus?" Who knows, man?
