          Men and Toys   Dale wanted a ZipZap car for Christmas.  I got him something similar, but mostly because i didn't want to wait to order a ZipZap and i didn't want to go hunting around for one.  But he loves it.  All his dude friends love it.  Two of them have ZipZaps of their own.  These are grown men... :) They love their toys.  Legos are  THE  gift for any man.  No shit.    So i was watching Dale and Mike gleefully play with this little car, and i wondered where the hell are the toys i want? Are there even any?  I would like Legos.  I would like tools.  A nice set of socket wrenches (that had both English and Metric, and included the always elusive 10, 12 and 13 mm sockets... why do sets come with one or two of those, and not all three?!)   I heard Gluttn's CD last night.  Great production.  I think i'll have to get Nick over to Lori and Mike's so he can hear what Esperance is doing.    This song is stuck in my head today: (well, here's a bit of it, anyway)   I got up for a bite to eat and found my clothes inside the icebox   I used to stand on my two feet, but now i sit when my new wife talks      The Posies "Suddenly Mary"  Some 13 years after first hearing this album (courtesy of Mr. Scott Aicher) it's still new every time i listen to it.  Amazing that it came from the same place and time as Soundgarden and Nirvana.  I turned him onto NiNs "pretty hate machine" about the same time.
