         i had a really bizarre dream last night.  I just remembered it.  Some people (i don't know who they were) and i were at the Timber Inn (local bar) and there was a guy sitting at the end of the bar near the wall.  I recognized him as joey burns, of Calexico and Giant Sand fame.  Told him i had the 611 & the SOS album.  He was kind of a jerk... he said, "I'm not sure what you're getting at, do you want an autograph or something?" and i was like, no, i just wanted to let you know i have it.  I love the record. I STILL Love the record. I dig your bass playing, and i play bass, too..   but he was a jerk in the dream.  He acted like a typical PV surfgang dickhead, and it irritated the shit out of me.  Because in the dream, i wasn't trying to approach him as a fan wanting an autograph, but as a fellow bass player who i wanted to give some kudos to, as someone else who went to the same school as he did, and as someone who's admired his musicianship since 1984 or so.  He smiled condescendingly at me and acted like an asshole.    So, i don't know what it all means.  I didnt know him in school.. i think he graduated the year i went in as a freshman.  I know that when Dan had the record, i missed it.  It really is a very good album.  I'm annoyed because i can't find any way to get hold of him and say hi.
