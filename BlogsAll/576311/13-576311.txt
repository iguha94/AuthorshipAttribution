         oodles of folk have these, so here's my concession to the madness-            Celeborn   If I were a character in   The Lord of the Rings  , I would be Celeborn, Elf, King of Lothlorien, husband of Galadriel and grandfather of Arwen.  In the movie, I am played by  Marton Csokas .  Who would  you  be?   Zovakware Lord of the Rings Test      with  Perseus Web Survey Software           A sun shiney day outside. Like a Partridge Family sun shiney kinda day. C'mon, get happy!   Mostly a collective shrug of the shoulders at most of the names i wrote down. Almost a whole page! Extreme disinterest in Vaporlock as a band name. I hate not having one, though. Might have to use Too Cool for X anyway.   Yay i finally got another printer cartridge, so now i can print the flyers and entry forms for the regatta thing, print out the lyrics and tab for some of the songs we do.. gotta have the lyrics, i need that point of reference.  i think today i'll hole up and play my bass and violin for a bit. Nick wants to play the greenie sometime, so i'll drop it off down there one day when we practice.   I'm a pretty uninteresting person. I just play my bass and i'm married. I live in a town next to another town with a combined population of just around 25,000 people. Sometimes i hate it. Sometimes i can't imagine leaving it. I have an ocean, dunes, mountains, a river, a wild river, forests- all mine to play in. Well, not really, but you know what i mean.  I wish i could canoe more than i get to.   Last time i canoed, we pulled the thing off the truck too fast and lost it (caught it again before it hit the ground and busted up, though) and sheared off the mirror on the driver's side. Damn dealership wants $55 for a new one! So i found one on ebay and got it for $36. Deal.   Sometimes i read the paper and wonder what the hell is going on, and when, if ever, is it going to stop. What are we, dumbasses?
