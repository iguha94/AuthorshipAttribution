         I would love to see an American diplomat, preferably Colin Powell, head to Iran.   In '79, when the "students" stormed the embassy, i was 9.  30% of Iran's population is under 30, and so wouldn't remember the "revolution". It appears they don't care much for it, anyway, if the article in Details is right. A mostly bored, unemployed, well-educated mob of young people could do more for the US in the middle east than the CIA or FBI (especially in light of recent events in THEIR bureaus).  A couple of seeds planted here and there ~ The water and dirt already exists there for explosive change~ is all that would be needed to toss out the current regime.   What a slap in the face to pan-Islamists and anti-americans if our relationship with Iran improved. But politics don't work like that, of course. American politics, at least, don't offer up pulic humiliation to countries like Iran. We only do it to our own political people.   Nonetheless, i still think it's something the US needs to look at.  Iran doesn't need a propped up Shah again. Iran needs the clerics hung by their hamstrings in the bazaars. And a decent government. One that can distinguish fantasy from reality. Come to think of it, that's what all those theocracies need.   Plus, if we had access to Iran's oil, we would no longer have to rely on the two-faced Saudi government, would we?   On the Saudis- someone on a site i'm a member of says we shouldn't judge the whole country by the actions of the 9-11 hi-jackers.. or i guess and of these other Saudi nationals that keep magically popping up in terror plots.   No, we shouldn't. But it's hard not to, given recent evidence against them.
