            Missing.     X imitates X    Tammi and i went up to the tavern to jam tonight.  It was a warm night, but not as warm as last night. And the spirits are abounding up there.   I parked the truck and stopped to talk to one of the guys for a few before heading in.  The air was cool and still. The river was at slack tide. Pouring out of the tavern was    Dwight Yoakum's   "Streets of Bakersfield". I had the bass over my shoulder and we were walking slow, and i said 'I feel like i'm walking into a movie'. Little did i know...  First, i hadn't heard anything about these missing people yet. They were last seen about 7 miles up the road from the tavern. There was a detective up there for a while tonight.    Second, something unsettling happened with the tavern's back door last night.   There were a lot of people there having fun, but there was a sort of undercurrent of tension. It all felt vaguely unreal to me, at least. I felt like i had somehow been shifted one degree to the right of reality or something. People said weird things.  But i wonder about these two missing people. It was pretty warm all through the Fourth of July weekend. Even warmer up the river.  They were a little overdressed the last time they were seen, in parkas and wooly hats.   There are also two campgrounds on the way up to the Falls. The campgrounds were pretty full, this weekend.I imagine a lot of people were picknicking up at the Falls, so someone had to have seen them.  There sure isn't enough water in the river up there for a body to float very far, either. And they haven't found anything in or next to the river.
