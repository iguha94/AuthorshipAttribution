           The Runes  I've linked to an interesting story about a person who was told to vacate her shop from a shopping area because her beliefs ran the wrong way as far as "the community" was concerned.   In my experience, "the community" is usually only the Christians of any given area.  I've run into this while putting flyers up for my band.  Excuses for "no" run something like this-  "we only advertise for community events" (translation- church sponsored activities)  "I don't mind, but i have to let the manager see it first" (translation- I'd put it up, but there's no church name on the flyer.  The manager is just going to throw it in the trash.  have a nice day)  "What kind of music is it?" (translation - if it isn't simpering praise music or God's own country music, you're going to hell)  So, you see, its insidious.  It creeps up.  "the community" doesn't include me and my band, even though we live here, spend our money here, send the kids to school here and patronize these establishments regularly.  Places that have let us advertise with them, we happily plug when we play.  I've even worn a T-shirt on stage from a great local coffee place because they've been so supportive of us.    Most of the time, i just end up thinking, "keep your stinkin "community", your self-imposed Christian ghetto, and shove it".
