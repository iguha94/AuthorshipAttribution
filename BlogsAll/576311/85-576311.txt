         yeah.  I'm gonna fight 35-40 mph winds (in town, probably closer to 50 steady out at the bluffs) to get some pictures.  Well, anything for the reading public, i guess.  Actually, its cool as hell to go out to Simpson Reef park during high winds.  There's always a stiff breeze there.  i mean, it could be dead still in town, and you go out to Simpson Reef and the wind is blowin.  It's at the very end of Cape Arago Highway.  I call it Land's End, because it reminds me of Land's End in Pedro.  There are other Land's Ends, of course, one in the south of Wales, i think.  But, i digressed again!   I've gone out there in  high  winds.  Probably on the stupid side, because trees blow over and block the road and with no cell, no one would know i was stuck out there... I've gone out and watched people  leaning out over the cliff , that's right, the 100 foot cliffs, leaning over them, and being held up by the wind.  Ok, i've done it myself.  What a feeling.  The ravens do it, too. They leap off the trees with their wings in, spread their wings when they get out, "stand" in the air and get blown back onto the cliff or the trees.  And they're having fun doing it.  They cackle and caw and and chuckle and do it over and over.  It's crazy.  But neat!
