         there was a "protest" at the city docks along the 101 the other day.  an anti-war protest.  Complete with No War for Oil posters and blah blah blah...   Had i realized ahead of time that i would happen to be at the docks that day, looking at a fabulous private yacht called Discovery, i would have brought a large supply of blindfolds with me for these people.  As it was, i had to walk past them, and it made me physically ill.   Someone on Instapundit mentioned this as the core of what peace-protesters don't understand- that if we send soldiers to die, they might, and it will probably prevent civilian americans from dying.  If we send no soldiers to die, american civilians probably will die.    Not much of a pundit, am i.  Nope.  Maybe the peace protesters don't need blindfolds. Already, they seem blind to the fact that there is someone who wants to kill them for no other reason than they are american.  It's okay with them, though.  Just don't send our "kids" off to kill for "oil". kind of reminds me of someone standing around saying "love your neighbor" while the neighbor has a gun pointed at their head.  Which, in turn, reminds me of the sad Native American cult mention in Seven Arrows.. that these magical shirts that the shamen dictated designs for repelled the white man's bullets.  With that in mind, the tribes rode headlong into battle with their spears, arrows and coup-sticks, only to be slaughtered to the last for it by the bullets.
