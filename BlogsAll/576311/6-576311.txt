         ah, well, it seems i have unleashed a sort of monster.  No prob.    We  can  say "Powers" in one syllable.  "Pee".  as in, "I'm going to Pee this weekend, would you like to join me?" Should we go bother the Timberline about playing there? I'd like to have another one of those tomato things they have.  It may have to wait till after the 15th tho.  (*smacks head against wall repeatedly*). Wanna go to Bald Knob and see some snoooooooow!   We will have more fascinating pictures when we can corral some poor schmuck to take them, while we are all in the same place.  Some will be gotten on   Valentine's Day  when we play with the Densmores, of course.  (That's 2/14, folks, at Roger's Zoo again, in beautiful downtown North Bend)  and more will be taken    The Day After  (that'd be the 15th, for those of you with swiss cheese where your noodle should be, like me) when we grace the Free Souls with our presence again.  At 8 PM.  At the clubhouse.  Next to the boat.    Pass some of those fliers for the Free Souls gig out to your friends, mmmkay? Don't go posting them all over town, cos it is what it is... .  And i'll get the List List out probably this week sometime.
