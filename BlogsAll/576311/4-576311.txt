          Upcoming gigs   I'm quick this way.  I got torqued on my birthday AND managed to book a gig with the fine folks who put up with the "kiss my ass" song and dance for 20 minutes. I think i got help from Jeff and Tam, though.  So,    January 18  we'll be gettin rowdy at the Free Souls MC club out on Empire Blvd.  Its next to the Fleetwood.  Or, the Fleftwood, as some may remember it.  This is a private club but we can have our fans come out.  They do serve liquor, on a donation basis.  While you are there, you will probably be asked to buy a sticker or button from the club.  They're cheap, so go ahead and buy one.  These dudes are nice guys.  They didn't toss me out on my birthday, and i would have surely tossed me out.     February 14  once again with Sam and John Densmore and their bands at Roger's Zoo in downtown North Bend.  I have no details other than we're playing there. The fabulous DJ will be there again, too.  When more is known, i'll put it here.  We're finally got "Tread" into its final stages.  We smoothed out a couple of rough bits on it this week, played it through 80 million times, and i do believe its ready for the big time.  So, hopefully, we'll be playing it at both of those gigs.  We're also about to start on a song Tammy wrote about a week ago.  Someone said, and i think it was Jeff, that after you write one song, it gets easier.  Seems to be the case :)
