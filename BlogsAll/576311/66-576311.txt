           Know this guy?   Here's a note to Glen Reynolds at    Instapundit   from someone who wants to talk to him.    WANTED: ONE EYEWITNESS TO HISTROY by Deroy Murdock  Have you seen this man?  I would like your help in identifying and locating the short-haired young man whose face the Associated Press beamed worldwide last September 11.  In an award-winning picture, AP photographer Suzanne Plunkett captured this gentleman running like hell as Two World Trade Center collapsed. Clad in a white shirt and dark tie with his backpack's straps over his shoulders, he races east on Lower Manhattan's Fulton Street with a look of sheer horror on his face as a menacing, white debris cloud races up Church Street, one block to the west.  I have wondered since I saw this world-famous image who this guy is, where he was that awful day, what he saw and how he has recovered from that trauma (if he has). Unfortunately, Ms. Plunkett knows neither his name nor whereabouts, nor has either of us ever seen him interviewed.  If you have any contact information or other details on this man, would you please pass along whatever you know? You may e-mail me at deroy.murdock@verizon.net  Feel free to forward my request to anyone else who might be able to help. I will write about whatever I learn from this eyewitness to the horror of 9-11.  Best wishes,  Deroy Murdock Syndicated columnist, Scripps Howard News Service   Just passing it on. Who knows, in the random assortment of people who pass through here, maybe someone knows...
