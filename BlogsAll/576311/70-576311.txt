         the maryland guy did it again.  Hindsight is 20/20, but i honest-to-gawd on sunday thought "he'll be back monday".    In a moment of dementia last night, i thought this:  When they catch this guy, they can kill two birds with one stone.  First, catch him.  Then send him to Iraq.  Tell him, if you can take out Hussein with your famous one shot one kill MO, and then get out of the country alive, we might reduce your sentence by 10 years.  (assuming he'd probably get life in prison for what he's done, 10 years is not that big of a concession).  If you don't come out alive, well, we've just saved the taxpayers money on your prison stay.  Either way, we win.    In my mind i've started calling the guy Union Sniper.  Cos he don't "work" on weekends.   I know, this is all terrible, a chortle at the expense of innocent people, but, cripes, man, just how much death and destruction can a weak westerner handle before they crack? Just like after 9/11, when i found myself hunting down people and things that would make me laugh til i cried, so i wouldn't start crying over it all, because i knew it would be difficult, if not impossible, to stop.     I know two people in Maryland. One is a very close friend.  The other is   Brown Crayon , who i don't actually KNOW personally, but enough to say if i met her in person, i believe i could call her a friend.  Lord and Lady protect the both of them.
