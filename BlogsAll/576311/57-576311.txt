          Bovine update:   Apparently, the critter was okay.  I scared the shit out of it, literally, according to Loris husband, who went up to check the spot on the road on Sunday morning on his way to church.  (Allegany church i'll have to explain sometime.  It's not what anyone thinks...).  he said there was cow shit all over the road, but that Boyd's wasn't at the dairy.  Boyd's is a mobile slaughterhouse.    Talked to some other people, though, and they said a few days ago that guys cows had gotten loose and there were four or five of them on the road, which she had shooed and herded back into the pasture and then told him about his gate.  fabbalus.  It made me feel not-quite-so-bad.  If this dude can't keep his damn cows in their pasture (not a free range area), then he better not get upset when a cow/bull gets hit on the road.  I feel bad for the cows, but not the owner, in this case, who had been warned about his malfunctioning gate.  Cripes.  People.  Someone else mentioned that if i wanted to be a jerk, i should roll up to his house in tams truck and show him what his misguided cow did to it and ask him to pay for it.  Times are tough... i'm not gonna do that.  If it happens again, though, and i don't care what time... you better believe i'm gonna be bangin on that dudes door about it. If it had damaged her truck much worse, yeah, i would have been at his door at 3AM bitching. As it is, we can probably come up with the money to fix the truck.
