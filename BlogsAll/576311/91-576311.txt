         haven't had much to say the last few days.  day? whatever.   exciting news: got pulled over for being a one-eye tonight.  Had no license on me (at friends, where i left my book thingie), expired insurance... usually a one way trip to a cab ride home and the impound yard, but for some reason, the officer was really, REALLY cool and let me off with a ticket.  I stopped and bought a headlight at wal-mart (a cheap one).  Amazingly, it was an OSP officer (state police).  It's not like i turned on the charm or anything.  I just sort of assumed this air of "harried, late, abesentminded single parent" or something and *poof*, no prob.    My friends adopted son (not legally or anything, he just spent more time at her house than his own house) is getting shipped out this weekend.  He's Army airborne, but not sure what division or where he's heading out from.  I met him finally at Christmas this year.  She put me on the phone with him. I told him good luck and to kill a bunch of bad guys.  Well, wtf else do you say? "Be sure and take out as much collateral damage as you can, and then dance on the corpses?!" He's not particularly worried, which i think says a lot.  Either we face a wet paper bag or he's lying.  Who knows.
