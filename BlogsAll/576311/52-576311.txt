          Excruciatingly boring non-event of the week   I bought a new sticker today.  i put it on my bass.  yes, i get excited about stuff like that.  this one happened to be a "Virgen de Guadalupe" sticker i got out of one of those machines you see everywhere for fittysint.  It's grey and black and silver.  Mui Catolico.  I dig it.  Its right below the pickup on the Ibanez now.  Virgen Maria is very latina looking.  dark hair and eyes.  I love it.  I'll have to get more.  the restaraunt i got it from is the best Mexican food place in town (and believe me, i've LOOKED) and a really swell lady runs it.  She gets Norteno and Pop bands to come up and play in the community center.  she was telling me she was trying to get a larger venue, so i told her about the new performing arts center at the college.  Better to have bands there anyway, since the sound at NBMC sucks SO DAMN BAD.  (nothing like sitting in a wood rectangle that just bounces the soundwaves all over the place, rendering it all as MUD.) I've seen some great bands in there, bands i know rock in a different place, but the stupid center just has the WORST acoustics.  Good for actual acoustic gigs, or vocal performances, but get amps and stuff in there and it's just shitty for anyone.
