           Live : Throwing Copper   I just dragged this out of the CD shelf after about three years.  I forgot how GOOD this album is.  Lyrics notwithstanding, the music is great, too.  But whatsisname really has a good grip on using words.  He uses excellent words, and sprinkles a bit of alliteration in here and there.     I got this CD when i lived in Arizona.  Just after i moved into the house at 10th and Horne, before John the roomie moved in.  So the CD reminds of me bright, warm, spring Phoenix days and spending inordinate amounts of time lazing about with friends and getting tanked.  I wasn't driving at the time, so that wasn't an issue, and clubs were within walking distance. Cheap booze, usually, too.    So, John, Tom, a Fastlane toast to summer nights drinking Kaluha, watching World News Tonight and vanilla ice cream... to Sunday morning nutcase radio, waiting for Jim Hightower ("If i shoot a guy on my porch, should i bring him inside?")... To Negativland, Corey, DanDan, Ivars, and Foreskin 500... IRC parties and Goldschlager, more pot than we knew what to do with... Four Peaks and rabid javelinas... escaping Luke and Matt, monsoons on the roof with the tripod and 3 AM roofers. And Tom's backyard adventure with the ghettobird. ROFL!   Today is ebay day at bobs, so check out the link to what he's got on later... probably after 5.
