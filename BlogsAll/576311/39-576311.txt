         ok here goes, the drums, ex-boyfriends, etc thing.  When i was like, hrm 16 or maybe 17, i lived in this house full of punks.  I guess there were a dozen of us sleeping there at any one time.  The guys whose dad owned the house had a band, and the one of the brothers i was dating was the drummer.  the other brother was the singer.  he was an ass. Thats beside the point.    So one day billy decided he wanted to teach me how to play the drums. cool. i'm on it. i couldn't play anything, except a little piano and some easy french horn stuff.  he was all serious about it, battening down to teach me to play, like it was goin to be a lengthy process.  he showed me how to hold the sticks, and how to organize my limbs and stuff, and then demonstrated an easy 4/4 rock thing.  After about 20 minutes, i was pounding away on the drums, and he was standing there with his arms crossed over his chest, frowning.  turning red. steam coming out his ears.  So i stopped. "What's the problem?" i asked, innocently.  "What's the problem?!" he said.  "I just showed you how to do that and you're already jamming away.  You aren't supposed to be that good, or learn that fast.  You're a girl."  So he was pissed at me for days, because i learned to play some shitass basic drum beat faster than he did, and because i was a girl.    So now, whenever i get to play the drums, and i take the opportunity whenever i can, i get a sort of smug satisfaction out of it.  hah billyboy! Well, it shocks everyone, usually, when i grab some sticks and pound.  i don't play well or anything, or do anything fancy, but i keep the beat good.  That's all i care about.  i try to throw in fills once in awhile and they always foul me up.
