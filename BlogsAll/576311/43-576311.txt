         welp, i've put it off long enough. It's time for the truck to get some kinda major work. The axle bearing and seal on the passenger side have been bad since i got the truck.  the seal has been replaced more times than i can remember, and every time, within about five months, it blows out again and starts flinging grease all over that brake drum. So, lovely truck is getting two new bearings, seals, wheel cylinders and four new shoes. (i'm so happy the fronts were okay, and waay surprised, and also waaaay stoked that i don't need new drums or rotors.)  It's also getting a new power booster. *whew*. Should hold it off for awhile. It'll be soon time for a new clutch.  I think the front end needs work again. But these can all wait, for now.    Poor thing has 210K miles on it.  and somehow i broke the transfer case nose cover and a piece of it is hanging off the front driveshaft. I dunno how that happened. it hasn't been off road forever because of the bearings.  My driveway gets pretty bad, though.... Come to think of it, the truck made a lot of weird noise when i went out poodling around in the snow this winter, and it may have been that piece dragging along the driveshaft. *shrug*.  Coupla minutes with a screwdriver should fix it. Bah.
