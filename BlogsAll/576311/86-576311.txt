         I've had four songs rotating through my head for a week.    Audioslave's "Cochise" A Foo Fighter's song i don't know the name of yet The song the band is working on (we wrote it)  and this one which pops up about every two months:   Faith No More Angel Dust (1992) RV  Backside melts into a sofa  My world, my TV, and my food  Besides listening to my belly gurgle  Ain't much else to do  Yeah, I sweat a lot  Pants fall down every time I bend over  And my feet itch  Yeah-I married a scarecrow  I hate you  Talking to myself  Everibody's starin' at me  I'm only bleedin'  Someone taps me on the shoulder every 5 minutes  Nobody speaks English anymore  Would anybody tell me I was gettin' stupider?  I hate you  Talking to myself  You don't feel it after awhile  You take the beating  I'm a swingin' guy  Throw a belt over the shower curtain rod  And swing - - -  Toss me inside a Hefty  And put me in the ground  A drink needs me  I don't  I ain't about to guzzle no tears  so kiss my ass  newscasters, coakroaches, and desserts  I hate you  Talkin' to myself  Everibody's starin' at me  I'm only bleedin'  Where are the kids?  maybepregnantorondrugs  oronwelfareontopoftheworld  onthehonorrolonparoleontheDodgers  onthebackofmilkcartonsonstakes  inthemiddleofcornfields  oncoversoffuturehistorybooks  onoldlady'smantleswalkin'onwaternailedoncrosses  I think it's time I had a talk with my kids  I'll just tell 'em what my daddy told me  YOU AIN'T NEVER GONNA AMOUNT NOTHIN'   ---- That's one of my all time favorite albums.  I efffin love it.
