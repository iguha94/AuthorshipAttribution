           Jim Marrs   Last night, while i was DESPERATELY looking for something interesing to listen to on the radio, i flipped over to the AM dial and came across a "Coast to Coast PM" or something like that, and they happened to be talking to this guy.  He didn't sound like a UFO weirdo on the air.  He sounded pretty grounded in reality.  He actually seemed like someone who approached the stories of UFOs with some kind of scientific mindset, which was pretty refreshing.  He cited stories going all the way back to the 1800s, up to a year prior to the Spanish-American War.  And he had done some ground research on his own, quite a bit actually, and some of it turned up some weird findings.    On the other hand, it's stuff like this that feed the conspiracy crazies.  Yeah, i did say crazies.  For a time in Arizona i spent a while learning/being involved in about a movement called "Constitutionalism", which is basically a group of people who totally discounted anything that wasn't in the original Constitution and Bill of Rights.    You wanna talk crazies?! Find these people... The US militia movement is a sort of shoot-off (pardon the pun) of the Constitutionalists.    In several of the seminars i went to, the only thing that seemed to separate the hardcore militias and the Constitutionalists were the fact that the militias firmly believed the world was run by Jews.  But the Constitutionalists had a lot of weird ideas outside how to interpret the Constitution.
