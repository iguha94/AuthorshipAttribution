         I think we're going to start playing again.  Yay!   Nick & Tam are gonna die when they hear the 100-pound EFX unit.  Except for the nasty hum on it...  Oh yes, did i tell you about the EFX box?   A friend of mine gave me a Yamaha G50 4 x 10 guitar amp.  Something is wrong with it that it doesn't put out as much sound as it should, and it has a nasty hum to it.  So i ended up running it between my bass and my bass amp. The Yamaha has some tone controls that the Peavey doesn't- reverb, trem, distortion and some more fiddly knobs i'm still messing with.  It also has  just enough  oomph to really boost the Peavey, so i don't have to drive the bass amp so hard to be heard over Jeff and Nick, now.    The Yamaha is rated at 120 watts, and i think i'm only getting about half that out of it.  So, now, in total, I'm pushing 130 watts.  If i ever fix it, i'll be just over 200.   There's just this problem of the hum in it, now.    But here's the best part: I can get the Jack Bruce tone without the Jack Bruce mod on the bass, now.  *yeeeee*! (stimpyface)  ********  Also saw Ea$y Money last night.  Boy, have THEY tightened up!
