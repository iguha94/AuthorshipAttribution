         whoa, my post times are askew again, and some are missing, and they aren't the ones that were missing earlier.   oh well.   so, i've been reading a lot about the RIAA lately. And the record companies. and big piles of money. and napster and other peer-to-peer networks. let me get this straight-  1. in the late fifties, DJs were busted for taking payments to make songs top 10 hits. This is payola, in its original form.   2. somewhere along the line, RIAA was founded to protect artists and labels. ASCAP and BMI were simply not enough. Harry Fox Publishing Companies lawyers were not enough, either, because  3. A couple of years ago an online guitar tab archive called OLGA was made an example of, and shut down, basically for the same reason napster has been shut down   4. which was shut down because the record companies and some artists thought people were stealing the music instead of buying it, because sales have dropped   4a which is really caused by the fact that modern pop music sucks  5 because no one listens to people who listen to music  6 because the record companies are picking the songs they want to get a hit out of  7 and paying radio stations large piles of cash for the  chance  to maybe get a hit out of it  8 and so the record companies are pissed at the radio stations because they have to pay them all this money and they aren't guaranteed a hi6t anymore  9 so they have shut down the two best ways to get FREE distribution for their artists (peer-to-peer file sharing services and webcasting)  10 because people WERE being exposed to new music, for free  11 and the people in the record companies and RIAA didn't like the fact that  12 because THEY have to pay to have the music played  13 the rest of us should pay EXTRA to merely hear the music, that sucks anyway.   and i'm confused, really, because all i see is the record companies just bent themselves over and were happy about it. They got what they wanted. And now they're complaining about it.
