         "So, you're married?"  I get that comment more than i kinda like.    While camping this weekend, Lori "Hoov" Carillo, my drummer friend, and i were talking about music and bands and our bands and stuff, and this guy was kinda fucked up sitting near us. She knew him, i didn't. But after a while, he said that. So that's weird and all.   And i was getting change at the laundromat so i could wash Truck on Saturday. I dropped a $10 in the slot and was collecting my quarters, and the laundromat-nazi was hovering over me. "Are you going to do your laundry here?". I told her no. She said they wanted to keep the quarters for the customers and not to do that. So i started a spiel on her. "Well" (says I) "I'm taking these to another  locally owned business  to deposit quarters into their machines. You'll get them back, since i'm pretty sure at least one of their employees uses this laundromat. But i can always tell them to use the other one. " (big, shit eating grin on my face) Then i just left. I know. Anticlimactic and all that.   Something else happened today that i pondered sharing. hmm.   I'm starting to feel low again. That's not what i wanted to say, though.  hmm.  hmm.  hmm?   I need to write this stuff down. I've been telling myself that for years, though.   i hope its nice this weekend. i really want to canoe.    oh i know what it was. i got to watch the S. Carolina vs. Toronto hockey game tonight. SC got the spot, and on they go to the Stanley Cup! Wild, man! I love hockey. i forgot how cool it is to watch it. The fluidity of the movement on the ice juxtaposed with the violence.. it's just cool to watch it.   Oh and i started watching Das Boot. First time i'd ever seen the English version of it.. the dubbed one. I haven't even seen the subtitled one, only the one in German. That movie's fuckin rad, though. I think i got about halfway through it tonight.
