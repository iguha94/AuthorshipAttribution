          a small moment, ingrained. Inappropriate emotional response in a moment of severe stress   I went to the tavern on 9/11.  They had a TV.    Steve and i watched the footage.  the channel had live feeds of amateur video taken that day.  One, in particular, and the subject of this post, actually made me laugh so i hard i almost fell off my chair, and it was hard to laugh, because i was trying so hard not to just fall apart.    A guy had his camera pointed up at the towers when the second plane hit.  You can hear the crowd around him, yelling and screaming, and you can see bits of chaos in the periphery.  As the second plane hit the tower, the guy yelled "Holy shit! Holy shit! Fuck! Holy Shit!" on live feed network TV.  When the screen returned to the newsroom, the anchor people looked like deer caught in a headlight of a speeding semi, and one, in a very serious voice, said "well, you can't fault them for the obsenities".  And i laughed. In all that scary shit, all the terrible stuff that happened, i had tears streaming down my face, and it wasn't because i was crying.    I sometimes feel terrible for laughing. But i try to rationalize it... i had watched so much up to that point, i was totally unable to even think straight about it.  All i could think of was "what the fuck?"  Then i bought a beer. and steve gave me a quarter for change. and it was a New York quarter.  I have it somewhere still.
