         My mama kitty is sick.  She has a big cyst or tumor on her chest and she'll go to the vet Monday for it.  I may have to have her put to sleep if the ongoing treatment for it is going to be out of our budget (most likely, unless its a cyst they can just drain, but the lab work is going to kill me).  I'm not looking forward to that. She's still really spry.  She's 10 this November, i think, and came from Arizona.  She came up with Dale.  She doesn't mind staying with other people.  She stayed for two months with a friend in AZ at one point and was totally happy, and she was happy staying with Dale when i first moved here.  She rides in the car without any problems.  (don't really need a carrier for her). I found her when she was maybe 5 or 6 weeks old near a canal in the general area of 10th street and Indian School Rd in Phoenix.  She caught her assfur on fire walking by a candle once.  She likes to eat roses.  Just one of the coolest little cats i've ever seen.  My checkerboard boogarian, we called her.  She's a calico and there's a checkerboard pattern on the top of her head.  Her name is '66 Malibu Chevelle SS 396, but we just call her Chevelle. She once had a meeting with a spotted frog in Arizona, and it was funny.  The frog made this weird "cheeeeeee" noise, and she just sat and looked at it, looked at me, back at the frog, like she wasn't sure what to do with it or whether i was going to let her do anything with it.  She's gotten to play in snow and kept me warm by cuddling with me.  I'll sure miss her if i have to have her put down.  I have lots of pictures of her, at least.  *sigh*.
