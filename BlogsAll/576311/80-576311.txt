         Whoa, it's really fuckin windy outside.  *prays the trees make it another winter*. S'posed to be 55mph gusts at the headlands (what exactly  are  "The Headlands"?) between Florence and Cape Blanco.  Oregon's bucolic Bay Area is right about in the middle of those two.    I made 5 CDs as gifts last night for people.  None of them have the same song on them.  That's obscene, isn't it?  Probably 3/4 of the songs i used we own the record, CD or tape of.    That's nothing, though.  My ex-roomie in AZ, last i talked to him, was working through ripping all his stuff, from vinyl mostly.  I can't imagine there would have been a hard drive big enough for his stuff at the time.  He lined the walls of a 10 x 10 room with crates of records three crates tall.  The wall on the right side of his door, i think, was CDs, and he just had bags and bags of tapes.    Dan Dan the Taxi man used to record all his stuff to Hi Vi videotape.  If John and Dan merged their collections? fuck.  Actually, i think Dan ended up selling off quite a chunk of his stuff.  Sarah walked away with a bite-sized piece of Johns.  Sarah - now that's a tale.  But this chick had such a negative effect on me, that 7 years after the last time i saw or heard from her, i still fervently wish she was dead.  All the sudden, it will pop into my head, "I hope that bitch is dead".
