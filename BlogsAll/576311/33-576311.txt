         Yuck. a bug just flew up my nose. Lucky i know about the Farmer's blowjob.   well, heres the news.    Last week i recorded my part for my song, "Home" (for lack of a better title, it's been Home).  We did it on a Yamaha MD8, which is a very cool little pretty-shiny kinda thing. Multitrack recording in the privacy of your own home.. what a concept.  ok anyway, i have the rough cut of it, just my singing and the guitar/drum track with some backups by Beeb.  Saturday he came up to see us clear the dust out at the Riverside (we were too loud. NO! The place is just TOO small!) and he had the newest mix of it and played it, and it sounded pretty cool.   However,  it  felt  weird as hell listening to myself sing. I've never fancied myself a singer, but i'm doing more and more of it now and this is not really the BEST song in the world or anything (but i wrote it, so its ok). I sort of wandered around feeling... hmm.. stunned might be too strong a word, more like the ground of reality shifted a bit in one direction and left me standing somewhere else. What's weird about hearing a good recording of yourself  is that its like being in two places at once.  It really made  me feel (oh hell, i know there's a word for it.. criminy) off-kilter? Off-kilter is the closest. It sorta rocked my world. Tammi adores it. She says i sound cute. ick. I have a pretty weak voice, as far as forcefullness of it goes. I'm not real consistent in my breathing and stuff.  Ok, now on to update the ML page. Some good things happened last Saturday.
