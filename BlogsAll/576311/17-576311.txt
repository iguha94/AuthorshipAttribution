         Criminy  Dunno why i say that. I just think, sometimes, Criminy.   I didn' t do the usual jam up at Mary's tonight. i was soooo beat. I just couldn't have stayed up for it.   This morning i have to make a bunch of phone calls and straighten out some evil bills, and start paying them again, and get caught up on some others.   I want a new 4runner. I don't want an automatic transmission with it. C'mon.. it's a 187-HP V6. Mostly gutless. At least a 5-speed would give it some balls. Of course, this coming from someone whos first car had just under 300 HP. That one had an automatic. I can deal with that. But the Toyota i have now, an 86 4x4 truck, rocks. It has the 22RE (most indestructible engine on the planet, and i'll vouch for that) and a 5-speed, and the thing really moves. I've driven the automatics from the same year.  the lack of power is extremely noticeable. I think the last year they made the manual trannies in 4runners was 2000. i may settle for one, JUST so i can have that transmission, although HP is only 157 for that year. Trade-offs.. trade-offs.. i tell ya what, if i take it off the roads here, i better be able to haul its little ass through muck, sand AND get up over the passes on the I5 with a minumum of effort. I'm sure if i test drive one, the guy who has to ride with me is gonna crap his pants, too. i'd be all mellow through town, but as soon as i hit the dike on the way upriver, he better have his belt strapped on. Good place to test drive a car.. you can check the handling. Would have to crank up that 6-speaker system too and hear it jammin some Big Sugar.   I don't want an SUV just to have an SUV. I have to haul around our drummers crap, and the PA speakers, and the PA amp and the PA mainboard, so i need something that will protect the stuff from the ubiquitous rain here. I ain't havin a minivan. Toyotas rock, so that's my main choice.
