         mmmm.  haven't listened to Therapy? In a while.  goooood stuff.  Got the live version of "Sister" going.  Anyone know where i can get one of those thing-ays that shows on your blog whats on your Winamp songlist?  Dale and I listen to some cool stuff, if we may be so bold.    ______  As i poke around in other people's blogs, a lot of them talk about their work, or lack of it, or whatever is in between.  You don't see me talk much about my work.  I can't, really.  I mean, i don't haul into an office every day and deal with fucked up co-workers or anything.  I can say, oh, some doctors talk like they have their mouths full of crackers, or i like typing this one better than that one, but why bother.. that's boring.  All the interesting stuff i can't go on about.     _________  Band got the local paper's company Christmas party for a gig.  woowoo! So, i'll update the band page probably tomorrow.    _____  oooh... Now "Six Mile Water" is on.  Jeebus, this band is so rad.  Its just basic rocknroll, but they're so  prolific .  And the majority is GOOD rocknroll.  That's what i like.  I want stuff i can sing along to and bebop out to and have freak-outs in the car to.
