           Oak-tree killer found in redwoods, Douglas firs By BRIAN SEALS SENTINEL STAFF WRITER September 5, 2002   First.. i love santa cruz.  i fell in love with it ten years ago, just after the quake that leveled the downtown mall.  Now, the reason i linked to this.  It has been the policy of the timber industry to replant clearcut with Douglas fir.  Only Douglas fir.  Because it grows quickly. In Coos County, there are huge pieces of forest now planted with only Douglas fir. Timber farms.  They like to call them forests, but in reality, they aren't much more than timber farms.  I got nothin against loggers tryin to make a living.  They have to.  In an area where a good job means knowing the right person at the right time, i'll not begrudge anyone for taking what they can get.    But that's not what this is about.  I'm wondering what's going to happen to these timber farms when SOD makes its way up here.  We're already losing Port Orford cedar to another bug.  the fir and cedar tend to be big moneymakers.  Douglas is what the average christmas tree is (the other is noble, and there is one other kind).  I've always had a sneaking suspicion that monocological "forests" were a bad idea. The proof is looming, about 70 miles south.  SOD spreads in wet weather.  You know how oregon winters are... I'm wondering how long it will be before some of these replanted areas become big brown swathes of dead timber...  giant fires waiting to happen.
