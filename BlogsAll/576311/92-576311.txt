         I'm going to make Chevelle her favorite treat tonight.  Chicken, tuna and cream cheese, all mashed up in a blender, with (if i can find them) some red rose petals, cos she likes to eat THOSE, too.    I'm sad.    Yknow, when i would get upset, or yell or cry or something, she would come up to me and meow at me.  It really upset her to see me upset.  I was screaming at my uncle on the phone once when she was still pretty small, and she really freaked about it.  Came up next to me and just meowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeow.  She has a bark, too. She has very good timing, i found out once, when we were listening to FNMs "Be Agressive".  She sat in front of the speaker and mracked at each kick drum for the whole song.  She never minded being on a leash, which probably happened three times. Her first ride in a car, she sat on the back of the front seat and berated me for my driving.  When i lived in Chandler, and i would come home from work, she was always sitting in the window near the entryway, waiting for me.  If i had to leave for a weekend, or any length of time more than a day, Dale said she would make him open all the doors and she'd search the house looking for me.  She's always been happy to see me.  She doesn't mind being in the cat carrier as long as she can see me.  She doesnt mind being in a car while its moving, but doesn't like the carrier all that much.  In fact, at the vet today, when i was waiting to check her in, she was howling about it, but as soon as i sat back down with her, she was fine.  And she rode all the way up from AZ in a carrier and was mostly mellow the whole time.    This really sucks.  I'm going to cry.
