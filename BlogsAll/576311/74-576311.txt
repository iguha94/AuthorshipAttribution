         sigh.. if your looking for the mixerman/lance diary, just click on the link for mixerman over to the left.  They've moved the lance chronicle link, and i'm just not gonna fuck with it.  There is a link to the lance chronicles on the main page of the mixerman diary, now.    My opinions?  Mixerman is a better writer, spelling problems aside. The band being called Bitch Slap is fucked.  Oh yes, in a big way.  They already have over 2 mil in recoupables stacked against them.  their record BETTER be a number 1, or they'll be paying it off for the rest of their lives.   Reading the diary makes me NOT miss Los Angeles that much.  Lance's attitude is too prevalent.  blech.   Lance is an idiot for making the move on Harmon's gf.  Whether its "just friends" or whatever, it's a stupid thing to do.  people who practice modern paganism live by a code called the three-fold law.  This just means that every thing you do comes back to you, three times as bad or as good as your original action.  Ow.   Lance is an idiot, for being pie-eyed at Shortypants' office.  Think, now.. the man has gold records all over the place.. so he's managing quite a stable of artists.  If he has 10, and 3 are making him a lot of money, why bother with the other 7.  Eeyore has found a drummer he likes, and exchanged numbers with him.  How much you wanna bet that Eeyore ends up dumping Bitch Slap and starting something with this new drummer?! hey, man, we do that kind of shit all the time in our small ass town with musicians.  People get passed from band to band all the time.  like the stupid girlfriend who dates all your friends after you dump her, when you got her after some other buddy of yours dumped her.  Harmon has a reasonable amount of smarts, i think.  too bad no one took that into account on the cruise when they were laying new bass tracks.
