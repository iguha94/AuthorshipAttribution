I'm a rooster.  I can't help it. I was born in the year of the Rooster.  I tend more toward the masculine descriptions of Roosters than the feminine, too. I only say this because i keep opening up the picture of me thats on my profile and cackling with glee at it because i like it so much.  You could call this being an egotist or something similar, and you'd probably be right.  But hey, when you go through 34 years with only probably one really great picture of you once every three years, (although i think this year i've had two...) you really dig it when there's a good one.  Some lucky jerks are so photogenic that nearly every shot of them is fantastic.  They will never know the feeling of "Good Lord, i had no idea i was so good looking.  Must be the light or something. "  I can't stop looking at myself.  It's insane.   When i was about 4 my mom took me to Sears for some portraits.  Gramma was with us.  Gramma was appalled because i was dirty.  Typically dirty, for me. I was a filthy little child.  So there was this series of pictures taken of me, with my always bad hair and some smears of dirt under my nose.  My mom likes to say, "It's you.  You weren't a clean kid, and we could never keep you clean.  You were happiest in mud. If you had been clean in the picture, it wouldn't have properly reflected you at that time."    And so i will leave you with this, seen on a sign around town:   "Be yourself" is bad advice to give some people.
