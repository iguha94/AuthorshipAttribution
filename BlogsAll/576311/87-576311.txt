         April is, once again, late to the revolution.  I worked with film and a 35mm for so long, and had the joy of working in a darkroom at one point, that it's difficult to use a digital camera.  I'm used to composing the picture, setting up the light (usually in a roundabout way, because all of my 35s are old and unpredictable), bracketing 3 or 4 just to be sure at least one came out, and then throwing $11 away on maybe 3 good pictures.  There was a certain craft involved in getting a good picture, and then enhancing it or making it weirder/more impressive in the darkroom.  Now, my darkroom is paint shop pro 6, and i can do a lot with a digital and PSP, but things like long exposures or film pushing for grain and the like... can't do it.  Digital has its fine points, of course, and being able to look at what you've just shot is one, as is the lack of developing costs (this new digital will probably pay for itself by January.  I can easily spend $300 a year on film and processing, and that's using restraint...).  But the hands on, the craft, of photography, isn't there.  That's ok.  I certainly didn't sell any of my 35s off.  I don't intend to, either.    I have taken and manipulated some cool stuff in the last couple of days.  I have it in a Yahoo folder, and haven't put it on the harborside server yet because i have to clean it out.
