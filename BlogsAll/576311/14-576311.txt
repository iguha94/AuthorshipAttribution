         Great! My third shot at this, and i think it may finally prove satisfactory.   Here is my first ever Blogger post.  Nothing really on my mind today. I've had sort of a whirlwind week, I guess. Working, practicing with the new band, playing with the old band, bouncing ideas around for the First Annual Mighty Millicoma River Regatta coming up in August, trying to sleep, trying to stay awake, forgetting to do necessary things like return a borrowed CD and entering transactions in Quicken. Willfully neglecting doing my taxes, since i will again have to pay an insane amount of money to a government i didn't vote for, don't approve of.. etc. Regarding that whole mess, and what else could you possibly call it, i can only quote Johnny Rotten- "Did you ever get the feeling you've been cheated?".   I've been listening to a terrific rap song that came out in the early 90s lately. By the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, this particular song appeared on an Alternative Tentacles Compilation of Dead Kennedy's songs. DHoH covered "California Uber Alles", and man, it's wonderfully scathing. It came out around the time Pete Wilson was running, or pondering running, for President. I was living in Los Angeles for awhile before this, having returned home from Nashville in 1992 (or was it '91? Hard to remember, i only recall events, not necessarily dates), one day after the Big Riot.I stayed for a year before heading to Arizona, where another good year or so passed before i heard this song. I never liked Governor Wilson, and i was appalled that he would make the run for prez.   I have an assortment of adventures to write about, and a plethora of opinions to spout, and a large selection of oddball tidbits i throw in occasionally.  I started keeping on online journal sometime in 1998. It has mostly been removed, and redone, and this would be the latest incarnation of it. So, enjoy. Or don't.
