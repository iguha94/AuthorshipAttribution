         mucking around on the net and i found this site, which tells you what social diseases you have. let me tell you, i am a bit relieved that i could answer "no" to most of these questions. now i feel somewhat "healthy" or "normal" or however you want to tag it. here tis:       Disorder      Rating         Paranoid :    Low        Schizoid :    Low        Schizotypal :    Low        Antisocial :    Low        Borderline :    Low        Histrionic :    High        Narcissistic :    Low        Avoidant :    Low        Dependent :    Low        Obsessive-Compulsive :    Low       --   Click Here To Take The Test  --       there you have it. i am guilty of seeking constant attention, but hell, i could have told you that. why else would i have a website?
