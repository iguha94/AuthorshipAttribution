         I had the craziest dream last night. Disneyland had turned M.C. Escher and everything was wild. The park was on four spinning disks--but get this, the disks were finite to the top and bottom but ran infinitely in either direction side to side. So, there was a long path that cut the circle in half, and this never ended. more Paths went in other directions. I was there with Jessie and Natalie (of course) and we were on the "D" disk, which was sponsored by Donald or something. Anyway, from there it just turned into a scene from a Piers Anthony novel. We walked along the long path and it went over rivers and valleys and at one point, a beach volleyball game. And then we realized we had to get back so we followed this path that led back to the castle. There were more weird bits to the dream, but I thought the idea of an "infinite Disneyland" was pretty cool.  In the beginning of the dream (before it morphed into disneyland weirdness) I was a semi-blind girl who had been abandoned by her mother in a mall, and I was eventually adopted into some school for orphaned children. Anyway, I was apparently the heroine (or one of them) of a book, called "Three Cinderellas," because I went through this formulaic search for meaning, beginning with the discovery that I could actually see clearly if I tried, apparently I had a disease that made my eyes stay half closed all the time but I could fight it and I did. And then I went to the library to research who my mom was so I could find her and tell her I loved her or something. There was a weird scene involving a bandaid and a locker room shower, but I don't think I can clarify that enough to put it down. So, lesson learned here? Too much wine last night--;)
