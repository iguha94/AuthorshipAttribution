         "dear prudence....won't you open up your eyes?"  i'm feeling the urge to go on a cd buying spree.  here's what i want to get:  if i can find it, simon and garfunkel's concert in central park cake's first cd a tower of power cd with so very hard to go and what is hip? or la suerte de los tontos on it.  mussorkgy's pictures at an exhibition some more beatles. you can never have enough.   we see how it works out. it's a beautiful day in san diego...mild, sunny, blue skies and lots of promise. what shall i do today? i ought to practice, but we'll see how that ends up working out. what's marvelous is that i don't have to worry about doing any projects for school-type things. that is the most exciting and wonderful feeling ever. hurray for me!   i was thinking awhile back that'd it be awesome to have a school of music baby photo contest. or, to be less complicated, do it between sai and the phi mu boys. maybe i'll make that one of my projects for the fall. along with the whole vp membership deal. when i talked to bonnie on wednesday she said she'd like to see sai get more organized and less apathetic to volunteering and easier to work with. i'll pass that on.   obladi, oblada life goes on...bra la la how the life goes on
