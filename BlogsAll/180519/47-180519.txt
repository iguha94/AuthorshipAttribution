But with a little practice, you can throw like a pro.  More or less.   Steps 1) Grip the football by interlacing your fingers between the football's laces and seams.  2) Protect the ball by cradling it with two hands, and hold it just under your chin as you step back to throw.  3) Cock your throwing arm back with your elbow bent. 4) Extend your free arm in fornt of you for balance; point the arm and hand at your target.  5) Keep your shoulders level for a short pass (10 yards or less); dip the shoulder of your throwing arm for longer distances.  6) Snap your arm forward and floow through with your shoulders and hips as your weight shifts to your front foot.  7) Release the ball when your arm is slightly above your head and out to the side.  8) Add velocity and spiral to the ball by flicking your wrist and fingers just as you release it.  9) Finish with your index finger pointing forward and down, and with your palm facing the ground.   Congratulations everybody, you can now throw a football. Stay tuned for more interesting unrelated How-To instructions.   Anyway, I got a great email from Tara today.
