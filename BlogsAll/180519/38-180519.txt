         here's the big scoop on the last four craaazy days!  thursday, jon was here when i got back from work! so we (b and i) took him on a tour of the campus and learned about carillion bells, and watched traffic (good movie, set in san diego!).  didn't really get enough sleep (5hrs) as had to get up for work at six...but it was okay. Jon and I attempted to purchase alcohol using his fake (his brother's) but apparently madison is a tougher place to be underage than even california (he says, since he's had no problem with it there). anyway, Ben got us some, which proves that the youth of today cannot be deterred by silly restrictions. So we had a party!  A random, but very enjoyable, group of people came.  Wes, Darren, Sean and his gf Kristen, Collin (!),  Rachael from work, her friend Jason (who was very very cool), Alex, Ben, Jon, Davis, B, me, all told. Not a big party but we had fun! Despite not everyone being acquainted it went over very well. A minor incident occurred: Davis disappeared and we worried about her, but she made it back okay. She says she went for a walk. :) But she doesn't know where. hehe! Saturday arrives, and we go to Chicago! Alex had a little car trouble but we got off okay, around four, and made it to Ravinia at 6:30. Ran into Miah and Sarah! It was awesome. Caught up with both of them, and enjoyed Shostakovich immensely.  They played the end of the fourth half tempo and everything. The low brass was all ringers...but they still played amazingly. Man!! Someday..... Today we woke up and made blueberry pancakes...which were a disaster cooking but ended up being yummy anyway.  Sent Jon off at 11:30 and went to work, 1-4. And that is everything updated! A good time. I hope Jon had fun and gets home safe! :) Now, it's time to recover some sleep. pfft!
