         WOOOHOOO!!  What an exciting morning. It's not even noon yet and things are happening!!! My mom woke me up at 8 to take her to work, after which I promptly went back to bed for another hour...and then another half an hour, from which I was woken by my phone ringing (it was one of those surreal moments where you're not really sure what's going on and the phone seems like just another part of a dream).  The person on the other end of the phone was the person from the City of Madison---I got the lifeguarding job! Hurray! I'm missing all the training sessions, but I have to make them up when I get back. No problem.  Next stop, checking my email (since I've been cruelly forced out of bed twice, a third time falling asleep might be ill-fated).  Bonnie Abrams sent me a note about a swimming instructor job she found in the paper and----her son is conducting a musical this summer and needs trombonists. What's the musical? Ah. Ahem. Oooooh. Guess. It's my favorite  ever . It surpasses all musicals and then some, and not just because Frank was in the movie version. It made me dance about with joy the first time I saw it. It made me dance about, again with joy, this time mixed with pleasant surprise and excitement, when I saw those three fateful words in Bonnie's email. You have several hints. Guess. oh...what the hell. ON THE TOWN!!!!!!! Hurray! Hurray!  Needless to say, I emailed him right away. Another cool part is that he needs another 'bonist...and there are a lot of us crazy kids in town this summer. Collin, Erin, Emily, Beatriz, Jason, Sean....what fun if any of them were to do it! (i have my reasons for wanting a particular one...but the reason is very secret and must not be mentioned...)  alright..enough babbling about bernstein. i need to take a shower. (phew-ie!)
