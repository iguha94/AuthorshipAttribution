         Well, today I have proceeded to prove, once again, that I am a complete incompetent failure at dealing with unfamiliar social situations. (so incompetent that i even managed to spell "incompetent" wrong the first time I typed it)  Here I was going to put a rant about my SERF incident, but before I could write anything I dropped a bunch of cheesy noodles on my keyboard, proving that I am not only incompetent, but a dork and a klutz as well.  Anyway, I had a lot more speculations to put here...about why I feel like a dumbass...perhaps delve into the reasons behind it, but all my good and reasonable thoughts have been lost on the bike ride from the SERF to here, at my computer desk. I am wondering when I will learn, 4 days from being 20, how to deal with myself and others effectively. I think it is incredibly ironic (but perhaps not too much so) that my desire to communicate and be liked by most people is shot to shit by my obvious inability to even have words come out of my mouth in a clear and concise fashion.   At any rate, a good deal of my antics today may have been the fault of being a tad hungover, as hanging out at Jason's last night was a little too much fun.  But fun nevertheless, and part of my self-awareness realization for today is that although I'd like to know and be friendly with most everyone, there are certain people that are perfect for me, because they make me happy and I don't have to stress out when talking to them.  So I must let go of my desire to be 'everything to everyone' and be content with being myself to my friends. :)
