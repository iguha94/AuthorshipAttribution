         this week went friggin fast. and this isn't just a "wow, i can't believe how fast this week went" sort of thing. i'm feeling like i stepped into some sort of time continuum in which i couldn't feel the passage of days and then stepped out and all of the sudden it was thursday night. i mean, posting on sunday seems like i did it yesterday. and it's not like things haven't been happening this week that would make it slower or more memorable. i had a concert on tuesday, steve mead was here wowing us all with his euphonium genius...it's crazy but it makes my head spin. i'm feeling better---my stomach is still upset a bit but not so much as the past couple of days. now, my head hurts because i don't really know what's going on with jerry and i want to--but he's been awfully pensive and i'm worried. i don't know if he wants to hang tonight or not but either way he needs to let me know what's going through his head so i can relax, so we both can relax and enjoy each other's company again.  today also i felt like a raving grocery/housecleaning bitch and i didn't mean to be, so i'm sorry davis. everything is frustrating me right now and it is coming out in small stupid things. on a good note my high range is much improved today. but that's about it. i'm tired and i'd like a hug and a smile from jerry just so i know that everything's going to be swell.
