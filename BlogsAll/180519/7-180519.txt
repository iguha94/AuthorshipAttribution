         If nothing in the world is ulitmately real, than anything is possible.  Wow...talk about a power lecture today in buddhism. holy flying hippopotami. I think I understood it...but...i guess if all you do is sit around and meditate you have time to figure out that we are all in Buddha's paradise basically because he's using us to make sure that he will ultimately be "blissed out" as Prof. Dunne calls it. A buddha's compassion is only a means to an end in his search to obtain his own ultimate happiness.   Why doesn't it seem like we are in paradise? Because we are ignorant and the ignorance in our mind creates delusion and karma and karma leaves an imprint (even after it is expended) that clouds our vision of the world. Therefore, when we break free of the samsara prison and see without ignorance, we will know Buddha's paradise. BUT!! If you are a bodhisattva, you must create your own paradise before you become enlightened because otherwise you will exist in a negative state of meditation in which you can neither hurt NOR help anyone. And you can remain like that for billions of aeons before you wake up and then what happens? i have no idea. But anyway, before you are a buddha, you have intention, and through that intention you can create your own paradise. Anything is possible!! A buddha has no intention, therefore you must do it before. So, my question is:  If we're all in Sakyamuni Buddha's paradise right now, what happens when someone finishes creating their paradise and POOF becomes enlightened? Do we all move to his paradise because otherwise he can't be truly happy. Sure, he's enlightened, but his final goal is bliss. So he needs everyone else to be happy too. What's going on here? So we all have to become Buddhas, but we all must have our own paradise. hmm  so, ignorance is NOT bliss?
