         riiiight. my lack of posts might tell you that nothing interesting is happening...and you'd be pretty damn close to the truth.  On the Town has started, and so far it's been a fun time.  the music is pretty fun to play.  the singing is okay..the leads are pretty good, but they can never live up to the leads i have in my head (frank!) so that's a little disappointing but ah well, that's the way life goes.   other than all this musical stuff i have nothing to talk about. i'm sick of analyzing ryan, i'm sick of telling stupid stories about what happened at work, i'm sick of riding my bike and being in a swim suit twentyfourseven (ironic i should say that as i am considering going swimming right now).  In other words I've reached that point in the summer where if school started in two weeks I wouldn't be upset about it. I'd secretly be excited while on the outside dutifully pursuing an attitude of annoyance.    Somewhere in the time I have left of summer, however, I'm going home, which will maybe spice things up for a little while. It's due...I miss San Diego and friends there. I should be home for Natalie's birthday...so maybe something exciting will happen around that. Surely she'll have a celebration of some sort! Also Marisa will be home, and I haven't seen her for at least a year! Maybe Megan too will magically appear and we can all go to the HCW pool and sit in the spa and recount all our college adventures (of which I have very few to offer that would translate well outside of present experience). If not, sigh. I will come back and practice like mad, have my audition, and start school again.  welcome, i say.
