         There's a terrific and strongly worded   op-ed piece  concerning the   Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act  in the Kansas City Star ("that's what I are," sorry that's a private joke between me and whoever else knows the song).     To restore the balance between consumer rights and copyrights, the Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act, HR 107, has been introduced in Congress. It ensures that consumers can use DVDs and CDs in ways protected by traditional copyright laws - where consumers decide where and how they view their legally purchased content. Not surprisingly, the entertainment industry that pushed through the copyright act is aggressively opposing HR 107 ... If HR 107 sounds like simple common sense, that's because it is. It is consumers who are driving the digital transition, and it is their rights that must be protected. The digital revolution is a revolution precisely because it allows consumers to enjoy more and higher-quality content, but Hollywood wants to turn back the clock and stop the progress.  After reading the op-ed maybe you'll be inclined to support the DMCRA   here , it takes all of 1 minute to send a letter to your rep.    Public Knowledge  has more on the DMCRA.  The op-ed is by   Mark Cooper , the director of research with the   Consumer Federation of America ,   article here .
