         Since I am going to be out of town for a bit I thought I'd give my readers some liks to keep them busy in the meantime.  These are some of my favorite blogs and so forth.  For information about the happs in NYC nothing beats   Gothamist .    990000  is as gorgeous a photoblog as you'll ever see, with classic New York City imagery.  For the latest tech news (and I mean up to the minute) check out both   Engadget  and   Gizmodo .  For some lefty politics I enjoy   The Daily Kos  and to a lesser extent   Eschaton  (by Atrios, who appears on Air America frequently) and   Balkanization  (written by Jack Balkan, the director of The Information Society Project at Yale Law School), and   This Modern World  (by Tom Tomorrow), and finally   Talking Points Memo  (by author Josh Marshall).    For insights into gaming, regarging specifically MMORPGs,   Terra Nova  can't be beat.  For IP and cyberlaw info I like to check out   The Trademark Blog ,   Susan Crawford ,   Wendy Seltzer ,   N.Q.B. ,   The Importance Of... ,   bIPlog ,   CopyFight ,   Lessig ,   LawMeme ,   Elizabeth Radar , and for legal "blawgs" in general I check out   b law g .    Other generally interesting stuff - if you've never checked out   Slashdot  you must do so now.  Also,   Wired News  is a great resource.
