               I have been getting lots of hits based on searches of "iPod vs. DJ."  Below is a list of posts on the subject.  The basics go like this - a Dell DJ of the same capacity as an iPod (15 or 20 gigs) has much better battery power (nearly double Dell says) and is over $100 cheaper.  The DJ also plays WMA files, which the iPod cannot (although the iPod plays AAC [an Apple format], which the DJ does not), both play MP3s of course.    My own experience is that iPods are very problematic, mine regularly wipes its memory and needs its OS reloaded multiple times in a row.  Also, if you own a PC you can't charge the iPod while it is plugged into the computer (unlike with Apples) so you can only load part of your playlist at a time between recharges (if it dies during an upload prepare to reload the OS again).  Also, the battery on my iPod dies after only a few hours of use (and yes, I've turned off all the battery draining options like the light and equalizer, etc.).  Basically, if you buy the iPod you are paying for Apple's marketing campaign but getting less in terms of technology.  I think Dell should be paying me to say anymore on this topic, so I think I'll end it here (until I get a DJ, at which point I will review it).
