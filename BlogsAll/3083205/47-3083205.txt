               Regular readers are aware of my   highly    negative    opinion  of Apple's iPod.    In the several posts linked above, I have recommended looking into the Dell DJ if you are considering getting a hard disk drive based MP3 player because it has double the battery time of the iPod among other differences.  I do not yet own a Dell DJ so take my opinion for what it is worth.  I do, however, own an iPod and I have had nothing but problems with it.    Anyway, I've been made aware of a   Dell DJ blog / user forum  which could be useful to those who are in the process of making a decision between the DJ and the iPod, or for DJ owners.  Also,   Dell is offering $100  to anyone who buys a DJ and sends Dell their old iPod.  A cool idea, but I you could sell any newer generation iPod for more than $100 on eBay anyway.    To be repetitive - the newly introduced INDUCE Act threatens the existence of the MP3 player as a device which induces the infringement of copyrights.  See   these    links    for  more INDUCE Act info and links.  Thanks to   Skrolls  for pointing this out to me.
