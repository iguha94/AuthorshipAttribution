         Ernest at   The Importance of...  has this topic completely covered.  Basically, after FOX sued over the title of Al Franken's "Lies and the Lying Liars..." book and was laughed out of court one would want to be careful when using the litigious FOX's material.    This post  is a good look at the issues involved.  Luckily for the producers of OutFOXed they had   Larry Lessig  and other copyright mavens to assist them in making their film infringement free and full of fair use.  See a clip of OutFOXed   here .  There are more clips to be seen at the   OutFOXed homepage  as well.  Here's a   NYT Magazine article  about OutFOXed and the "Guerilla Documentary."  Check it out before it gets archived.  Via   The Impotance Of...     Update  : I just noticed this more   recent post  at   The Importance Of... , apparently FOX is already threatening to sue over the film and were very pissed off about that NYT Magazine article linked to above.  More articles:    Film Calls Fox News Biased, Channel Cries Foul    Fox Fights Back Against 'NY Times' Over Film Story    FOX is claiming that this is all illegal infringement that is being supported by the NYT and "liberal billionare" George Soros (inducement to infringe perhaps?).  Awwwww, boo hoo.     UPDATE  : I've never had reason to link to   Wonkette , but thanks to   Tech Law Advisor  for pointing out that Wonkette has   all the internal FOX News memos  used by the creators of OutFOXed to show that Fox's bias.  It is quite a read just to check out the first few paragraphs.
