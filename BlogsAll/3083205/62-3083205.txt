         The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, a think tank funded in part by Microsoft, has concluded (but has not yet offered any evidence) that Linus Torvalds did not actually write the open source Linux operating system.  This is probably only worth noting because of Linus Torvalds response:   "OK, I admit it. I was just a front man for the real fathers of Linux: the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus. They (for obvious reasons) couldn't step forward to admit that they had gotten bitten by the computer bug and had been developing a series of operating systems on their own during the off-season.  "But when they started with Linux (which they originally called Freaxâ€”they do feel like outsiders, you know, and that's a whole sad story in itself), they felt that they could no longer just let it languish in obscurity.   "They started to look for a front man, and since Santa Claus is from Finland, and thus has connections to Helsinki University, and the Easter Bunny claimed, 'He's got good ears, if a bit small,' I got selected.  "Since then, I've lived a life of subterfuge, always afraid that somebody would find out the truth. I'm actually relieved that it's over, and that the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution has finally uncovered the lie. I can now go back to my chosen profession, the exploration of the fascinating mating dance of the aquatic African frog."  Of course, the reality is that the think tank is claiming that most of the material used in the operating system was lifted, not that Linus didn't put it together.  But who cares, it's funny.
