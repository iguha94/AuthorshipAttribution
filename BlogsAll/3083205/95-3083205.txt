         Republicans sure know how to party, and they need lots of strippers and prostitutes to do it.  The Republican Convention is to be held in NYC between Aug. 30-Sept. 2 at Madison Square Garden.   Agencies are flying in extra call girls from around the globe to meet the expected demand during the Aug. 30-Sept. 2 gathering at Madison Square Garden.  "We have girls from London, Seattle, California, all coming in for that week"...    Charging from $300 to upwards of $1,000 for an hour of companionship and a whole lot more, escorts said they can always count on conventioneers for big business.  Sex for money is a bipartisan activity (and I'm sure the Dem Convention will be no different):   "It doesn't matter what party you come from," said Robyn Few, a $500-an-hour California call girl who now runs Sex Workers Outreach Project, an advocacy group. "When you want to buy sex, you will."  Bah-humbug to morality and family values:     Clubs have started booking private parties for delegates anxious to ogle topless beauties after a day of watching fully clothed politicians boast about family values.  It is apparent that the GOP had planned this convention in NYC in order to take advantage of its proximity to the site of the 9-11 attacks.  Obviously New Yorkers, being fairly liberal in general are not very excited about hosting their guests.  Expect massive protests to go on while the conventioners cavort with their female companions.   New York Post article   here .
