           "Rivals challenge iPod's dominance.  Apple's iPod may be the flavour of the month, but there are better and cheaper choices, says a computing magazine."   Thank you, it's about time someone mentioned the other HD MP3 players out there.  The iPod is a piece of crap, I have one and I hate it (when it works).  The only reason for its success is that it was first and has a big marketing campaign.    I've been eyeing the Dell DJ as my next choice.  It's cheaper, has more memory, and a battery that last twice as long as the iPod's.  Too boot, it probably won't have buggy software (at least for PC) or crash constantly.  I have spoken with plenty of iPod owners - they all say they have problems with their iPod and that it took them forever to get it working, yet they all claim to love it.  I think they are just loathe to admit they got ripped off by a trend (ours was a gift, so no sweat really on the money although I have dumped at least 20 hours into trying to make it work/fix it over the last 8 months since we got it - it's about to go on eBay).  Don't waste your money on an iPod, look around.  Dam, I could rant iPod hatred all day.  Via   the Beeb .
