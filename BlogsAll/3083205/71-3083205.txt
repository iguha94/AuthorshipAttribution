               More parody or satire! A great day indeed. Apple is all in a tizzy over these new ads for Fuse, a TV channel. Check out big pics of the offending ads   here . Frankly, the Fuse ads are much funnier than the iPod version. Although the others are more scandalous, my favorite is the one with beer bong action, I haven't done that since college.   So...the ads do not really seem to target Apple or the iPod specifically, but perhaps they offer some commentary on how banal the iPod ads are.  This is a slightly tougher case that the   "iRaq" ads , which were obviously satire.    If the Fuse ad pictures were not so funny, I'd be inclined to think that the Fuse ads are neither satire nor parody, but purely an appropriation of Apple's ad style.  Since they are obviously meant to be humorous I'll have to say that this is likely parody because it is obvious that the ads, while functioning as marketing for Fuse, also make a strong point about the boring and banal iPod ads.  After viewing the Fuse ads the iPod ads no longer seem very meaningful, the Fuse ads defuse them, so to speak.  It's a close case.  Apple has a strong argument that the ads do not target them at all.  We'll keep an eye on this and see what happens.  Via   Gizmodo .
