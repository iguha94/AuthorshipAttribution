               I just have to point out this ad that is running on the front page of the   Washington Times  website for "Authentic GOP dot com."  They sell t-shirts that read "10 out of 10 terrorists agree anybody but Bush."  On their website they ask, "after all, whom would Osama vote for?"  Frankly I am surprised that any paper would run such an ad.  I guess the Washington Times is like the   New York Post  though, pretty much a scandal rag that leans to the right.  For instance check out   this  article by the editor-in-chief of the paper about how Kerry and Edwards "lock eyes frequently in deep contact and stop barely short of demonstrating what great kissers they may be."  The headline on the NY Post site is about how Whoopi insulted Bush at a Dem fundraiser  Ah, a quick search is revealing: The Washington Times is owned by "Moonie" cult leader   Rev. Sun Myung Moon  (of the mass weddings), founder of the   Unification Church  and a staunch conservative.  Moon is also reputed to be a friend of the Bush family.  Moon was recently "crowned" by US Congressmen, no seriously, I'm not kidding.    Here  is an interesting article in the Gadflyer about the coronation (there's more on   Wikipedia ) and I'm sure there's a ton of stuff about him on Google.      UPDATE  : A must see Doonesbury response can be found   here .  It notes that Bush  has  been a uniter...he's united Muslims all over the world against the U.S. (and squandered U.S. moral authority).  Check it out quick before it is archived.
