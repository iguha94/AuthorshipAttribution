One of the nation's wealthiest towns will soon have cameras and computers running background checks on every car and driver that passes through.  Police Chief Clay Walker said cameras will take infrared photos recording a car's tag number, then software will automatically run the numbers through law enforcement databases. A 911 dispatcher is alerted if the car is stolen or is the subject of a "be on the lookout" warning.   If you land on the "be on the lookout" list another camera will take a picture of your face!    Another reason this should be ok is that it isn't discriminatory in who it takes pictures of in the same way an officer may be.  The cameras and computers will check everyone, not just people of a certain ethnicity or from a certain county.
