         Now there's   AllOFMP3.com  serving up music by the Gig!  As the Russian site asks: "Is it legally to download music from site AllOFMP3.com?"  Well...   All the materials in the MediaServices projects are available for distribution through Internet according to license # LS-3лю-03-79 of the Russian Multimedia and Internet Society. Under the license terms, MediaServices pays license fees for all the materials subject to the Law of the Russian Federation "On Copyright and Related Rights". All the materials are available solely for personal use and must not be used for further distribution, resale or broadcasting.   Users are held liable for the use and distribution of the MediaServices site information materials according to local legislation.    And you can get the music in any of several formats or levels of quality, check it out:   The AllOFMP3.com provides a service called "Online Encoding". Online Encoding is a unique technique of online audio files encoding, which enables you to get music in the format (MPEG-1 Layer 3 - MP3, Windows Media Audio - WMA, Ogg Vorbis - OGG, MusePack - MPC, MPEG-4 AAC, etc.) and in the quality you prefer. By choosing compression method and bitrate, you regulate the quality of the resulting (encoded) files.    If you are afraid of giving your credit card number to some wierdo Russian company don't worry, you can use  PayPal ! Best of all, the price is 1 or 2 cents per mg, depending on the download (which makes it about 96 cents less per song than iTunes).   The full price per Gig then is between $10 and $20 dollars!   If it sounds too good to be true then it probably is -- this is clearly illegal in the US, and I bet that's where you live isn't it?  On the other hand, you better get yours while the gettin' is good, 'cause I don't see this lasting too long.  The RIAA probably already hired some ex-KGB assassins to go get these suckers.
