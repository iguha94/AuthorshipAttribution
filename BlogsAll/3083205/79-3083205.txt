                    Allow me to preface this post by stating that I really don't give a crap about Britney Spears or what she drinks...that said...  &nbsp;  I've described the   New York Post  as a   right-leaning scandal rag  in the past (and also   The Washington Times , which is no better - and is still running the "10 out of 10 terrorists agree anybody but Bush" ad on it's home page, if you don't know what I mean   click here ).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Proving me right yet again, yesterday the NY Post ran a huge picture on the front page of the paper of what they purported was Britney Spears drinking liquor from one of those mini bottles.&nbsp; Why this would even be interesting to anyone&nbsp;if it  were  true I do not know.&nbsp; As it turns out&nbsp;the drink was not liquor.&nbsp; Spears even has&nbsp;the&nbsp;guy who rang her up at the store on her side, saying he&nbsp;sold her a little bottle of ginseng.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This comes only a week after the NY Post got an "  exclusive " on Kerry's pick for running mate -    Gephardt  , oops.&nbsp; They keep screwing up because all they care about is being the first with the story, true or not.&nbsp; They really are no better than the&nbsp;Drudge Report (which, incidentally, is also running the "  10 out of 10 terrorists agree " ad).&nbsp; This time it looks like&nbsp;the NY&nbsp;Post's screw-up&nbsp;may cost them a   money&nbsp;settlement  with Spears.  &nbsp;  I used to get the NY Post on occasion because it is only 25 cents and is definitely easy reading on a lunch break.&nbsp; I've since sworn it off and I feel much more intelligent for it.&nbsp; When you read the NY Post you can feel your brain cells melting down, probably much the same as you would feel watching   Fox    News , which incidentally is owned by the same right wing media baron, Rupert Murdoch.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Here's the   NY Daily News  on the   Spears incident &nbsp;(they're always happy to point out the NY Post's failings), and here's one of many stories on the Kerry   running mate flap .&nbsp; I also found an article in the   Investor's Business Daily  entitled: "  The New York Post is becoming a bad joke ," unfortunately the article isn't there anymore.&nbsp; I think that title does just about sum it up though.&nbsp; If the NY Post were even 50 cents I think the NY Daily News (being 50 cents) would wipe it out (or if the Daily News were 25 cents).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The NY Post, Wash Times, Fox News, and the&nbsp;Drudge Report are all peas of the same pod.&nbsp; They aren't just trashy, they're misreporting the truth.&nbsp; It isn't such a problem when it concerns what Britney is drinking, but obviously when it comes to reporting important things like War, it can be a   problem  when half the country is getting   misinformation .
