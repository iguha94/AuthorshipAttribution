         A few weeks ago I walked into a video game cafe in the East Village just for a quick look-see.  It is called "  Game Time Nation ," and basically you can rent a machine and chill out and play whatever game you want.  You get charged by the hour, but I recall that the fee was pretty reasonable, around $5 an hour.  The place is basically like an updated version of the old-school arcade.  There are a bunch of chairs and couches gathered around loads of monitors.    The New York Times has an article  about the spot now - go check out the pics.  An owner of a California gaming lounge is quoted:   Our place gets you out of your living room...It turns video gaming from a solo activity into a social occasion. You're in a roomful of 30 or 40 people hooting and hollering. I predict it will become a spectator sport.   Have no doubts, gaming is no longer the domain of the lonely teenaged geek.  In South Korea, where about 60% of the populace has broadband Internet access (the   highest level in the world ),   online gaming is already a national past time  and a sport (  especially MMORG's ).  This is more than just a trend, expect a national chain of video game lounges to arise soon, and to come to your city.  This will be a huge business at some point.  Via   The New York Times .
