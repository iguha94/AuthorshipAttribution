         This is way cool.     US firm Microvision has developed a system that projects lasers onto the retina, allowing users to view images on top of their normal field of vision.    It's only a matter of time before we can use this to enhance regular old life and even to enter virtual realities.  Bring it on.   "Seeing is believing and seeing these images floating in front of you at about arms length distance is pretty incredible.  Reality can be enriched by having more detailed information about what you see."    Honda is already using the technology in car production.   The system has been years in the making and has only just come into commercial usage in the car industry, with Honda using it in its dealerships.   The first generation product, called the Nomad Expert Technician System, consists of a wireless computer and a hi-tech monocle, costing around $4,000.    Check this out.   There is still work to be done but potentially the system could become second only to tapping into the optic nerve in terms of getting images to the brain.   It could provide three dimensional pictures in perfect colour, able to simulate near or distant objects with complete realism, which could provide gamers with an intense sense of reality.    Maybe we can expect such a system with the XBox 3?  Via   The BBC  and   Engadget .
