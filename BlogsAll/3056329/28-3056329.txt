I started reading "Fountainhead" a while ago, but I wasn't able to finish it. Too much stuff going on. If anyone is looking for a good book to read I recommend anything by Ayn Rand. She's an amazing author.  Over spring break I plan to read "A Passage to India." I don't know much about it. My mom said it was good book. I should start reading it but I'm too absorbed in another book called "Battle Royale." It's by a Japanese author, and the book reminds me a lot of "Lord of the Flies."  The government sends a bunch of kids out on an island and they have to kill each other and whoever is left alive at the end wins. It has a lot to do with government control over the people and what fear can cause you to do. It also relates to the saying of it's a dog eat dog world. It's really bloody, but interesting.  Recently in AP US History we just finished up with WWII. We watched some video clips of the Holocaust with was really shocking for me. Anyway, I remembered something Mrs. VA said about her German friend and how he is still paying for WWII through high taxes, and how he was really upset because he had nothing to do with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. An interesting book which relates to this is "The Reader" by German author Bernhard Schlink. It's a deep book containing a lot of philosophy. It centers around a young man who wasn't involved in WWII but still has to deal with the horrors of postwar Germany.
