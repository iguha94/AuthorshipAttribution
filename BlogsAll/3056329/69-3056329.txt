Tomorrow we will move forward through the revolution and constitution and hopefully get the Republian Revolution and the era of good feeling.  I appreciate the feedback.  On friday I have a job interview in Seattle...Not that I have enough to do this week...but I am very excited about the prospect.    Friday - I could give you a multiple choice test again - or an essay prompt - or review - or centuries...Please use your review guide and review the Multiple Choice questions that you missed.   SUNDAY - AP study session 1 - 4 THE 1800s...Can people make it at this time?  Monday you guys have the test and the rest of the week we will review...  Essay prompt:   John Winthrop's goal was to create a "City Upon a Hill"?  Like John Winthrop, Jefferson believed Americans had a special destiny and responsibility: "The eyes of the virtuous all over the earth are turned with anxiety upon us as the only depositories of the sacred fire of liberty, and...our falling into anarchy would decide forever the destinies of self government."  This was the Republican vision of the City Upon the Hill. If Americans were to be a virtuous people, would all of the people in the new nation be allowed to become American?  Throughout history how and why have Americans struggled to live up to these principals?   I need a Muchas Gracias Burritto.  Ms. Clark
