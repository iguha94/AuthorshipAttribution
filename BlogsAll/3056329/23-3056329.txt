In a discussion about "Of Mice and Men" our group observed that George and Lennie's mutualistic friendship creates a theme of interdependence, which differs from the popular theme of self-reliance of the past semester.  The works of Emerson, Thoreau, and Franklin represent the fruits of solitude, and promote the benefits of self-sufficiency.  In contrast, Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" shows the loneliness of seclusion and explains how interpersonal relationships are necessary in leading a fulfilled life.  When George and Lennie arrive at the ranch they are hired to farm, their bond surprises a well respected ranchhand named Slim.  George takes exception to Slim's reaction and Slim explains there aren't "many guys who travel around together...maybe ever'body in the whole damn world is scared of each other."  Slim and the some of the other workers are envious and almost admire the friendship George and Lennie share.  Their relationship enables them to divide the stress of work and travel, as opposed to bearing it individually.  As the novel progresses the theme of mutualism stretches to recruit other characters.  Candy, an old, one-handed swamper, loses his dog to old age and sees lonely, desolate days ahead of him.  This depresses him and he spends most of his time staring at the wall of his bunk.  Crooks, the negro stable buck, isn't allowed to play cards with the guys, and is forced to sleep in a solitary room away from his peers.  Time eats away at these friendless men because as Crooks put it, "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody."  Although self-reliance produces independence and pride within a man, it cannot pat him on the back, play a game of cards, or swap stories the way a friend can.  Living as an equal in the world is an inherent human goal, and to sacrifice societal equality for isolation produces a burning loneliness that must be tempered with humanity.
