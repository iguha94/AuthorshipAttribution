Well I joined you guys here too. I was looking at the AP English Barron's book and it seems that in order to do well on the test we need a lot of just practice of taking the answers and knowing what kind of questions are on the test and how to interpret, it's kind of like SATs or ACTs, you do better on english part with more practice. I hope after spring break we will have a lot of practice on the AP mult choice and some timed writing.     The Challenge is to read some good books, I personally recommend "The Fountainhead" by Ayn Rand about individuality, the best book I have read and very inspirational. Also if you want some more background on the Holocaust you might want to read "The Pianist" or rent the movie, which I found to be very powerful, yet disturbing. I find reading literature such as "Night" important to remind myself every so often how superficial our problems are when compared to what people had to undergo during Holocaust, WWI, WWII, and even now around the world. Though I find it ironic to see American propaganda against German Nazis and the genocide directed toward Jews, when arguably Hiroshima and Nagasaki can be viewed as genocide directed toward "Japs." Also the fact that U.S. was supporting Iraq against Iran at the time when Sadaam was gassing Curds is especially interesting since the Kurds genocide is one of the reasons we had the war with Iraq. History is very controversial, especially when put in the context of literature. So yeah, liberty and justice for all (with exceptions to those that are different from "all").
