If love is a battlefield as Pat Benatar famously said, then Their Eyes Were Watching God is a top secret report addressed to the Female Commander that was intercepted and expressed mailed to the Male General.  Zora Neale Hurston writes about a woman named Janie searching for her soul mate and finding a few duds along the way.  In the process, Hurston provides insight into the female perspective in a way I've never encountered.  When women speak of love it seems as though they carefully construct a model of an ideal relationship, but the honest solitude of writing allows Hurston to leak key secrets about the art of war/love.  A recurring metaphor in the novel compares perfect love to the blossom of a pear tree, and through the exploits of Janie, the protagonist, the author defines the love blossom as a relationship in which a man treats a woman as his equal and respects her mind, all the while making her glow from every fingertip and toe. Easier said than done? Absolutely, but Their Eyes chronicles the mistakes of foolish men, writing a virtual how-not-to book on love.  I feel I'm a more complete person after reading it because I attained a deeper understanding of female emotion and compassion.  I believe Their Eyes is a book that should be read by all men because it teaches how women feel and why they feel the way they do, key bits that are rarely divulged and usually left to be deciphered through telepathy, a skill that few of us poor saps are granted.  Zora Neale Hurston's novel may be about encountering womanhood, but itâ€™s a worthwhile read for everyone because it demystifies the differences between the sexes and could possibly save or prevent a future dysfunctional marriage.   -By: Ryan Elliott   PS - I had no idea anyone could think as beautifully as Hurston does in this book
