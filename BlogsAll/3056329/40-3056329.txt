I actually really like the prompts that we have for the writing assignment, they give a lot to write about. I am going to write a parody on Catcher in the Rye, the book itself provides a lot of ideas to write about.  I think one of the major problems with olden is in his believe that people do things for the wrong reasons: not because it's what they want to do, but because it's what everyone else wants them to do. He expresses it in this quote about lawyers: "Even if you did go around saving guys' lives and all, how would you know if you did it because you really wanted to save guys' lives, or because you did it because what you really wanted to do was be a terrific lawyer, with everybody slapping you on the back and congratulating you in court when the goddam trial was over...?" And I find that to be true for myself, I sometimes wonder if I want to go to a great school like Harvard just because it's a famous school and it will look good on my resume or because I believe that I will actually learn better and enjoy studying there; I have to admit though that often the answer is: I like the name a lot, sounds big and important:(   I was also looking at this quote by Mr. Antolini in the book : "If you go along with it [academic edu.] considerable distance, it'll give you an idea what size mind you have. What it'll fit and, maybe, what it won't. After a while you'll have an idea what kind of thoughts your particular size mind should be wearing." I just happen to really disagree with this quote, just because I am against any kind of parameters set on a human mind and consciousness, I believe that there is no limit to our ability to learn and understand new ideas, and so there shouldn't ever be such thing as a "size mind" ... do you like it small, large, or supersize?  I like to analyze different "smart" quotes from books, gives you something to ponder about.
