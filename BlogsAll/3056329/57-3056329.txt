Hey, great action on the blog and I'm sorry I don't have time to post on that right now, but it's 330 in the morning.  I'm up because I saw the greatest wizard/witch-based movie of all time— Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban.  It was my favorite book, but I loved one and two as well and I didn't think the movies had entirely done them justice.  The new one is just that; new.  The new director, Alfonso Cuaron (something like that, he directed Y tu Mama Tambien) did an absolutely fabulous job making some changes that made the first movies lose a little magic (pun intended) compared to the books.  For instance, robes are worn only once that I can recall, being replaced by jeans and sweaters, making the characters more comparable to the muggle adolescents in the audience.  Also, Draco Malfoy, though still hateable, is now a coward in the face of confrontation.  He takes on the role of a character like Wylie Coyote in the fact that he had malicious intentions, yet always ended with a frying pan bent around his face.  Lastly, Pat said that it didn't always follow close to the book.  Don't get it twisted— none of the story was altered, however, in the interest of time, much quidditch is subtracted in place of plot advancement, which is entirely ok, because the foreshadowing is MUCH better orchestrated than in previous movies, making it much MORE like the book in that sense.  If you can't tell, I LOVED IT.  It was funny, fast, and satisfyingly sentimental.  I'll see it again w/ anyone that wants to go.  A word to the wise, I might be a little grumpy with the mere 3 hours of sleep I plan on getting, so if you must talk to me, PLEASE let the topic be Harry Potter.  Kahli Veys was there too, so if she's at school, she too can fill you in on the glory that is HP.  May all your sleeping patterns be much more consistant than mine,  Love Rob
