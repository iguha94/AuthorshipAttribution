HIII its jessica KOLKMEYER people have been gettin me n KNAB confused lol  anyways this is going to be a multi topic blog...... ABORTION AND THE MORNING AFTERPILL two of my favorite topics... abortion is WRONG it is murder etc etc the morning afterpill simply puts up an obstacle course for the little soldiers so they can't meet their fair lady! i agree 100000% with it i have had friends in the situation and its a scary one i know i dont want to me Auntie jess. Sex is a big deal if you have sex b responsible... IE condoms yes they fail then that is why you keep EC at home or make sure you or one or two of your friends has it so if anyone has an OOPSY then its solved. The abortion pill is call Ru-486 i remember the huge controversy over this pill in recent years, this is the one that KILLS what is already MADE it causes the cervix to open causing contractions which expel the embryo.. ok we are talkin about an embryo a LITTLE BEBE think of the difference of EC and the abortion pill.... like rob said the safest sex is NO sex! NOW gay marriage MARRIAGE IS FOR MAN AND WOMAN SORRY TO BURST YA'LLs bubbles  im not against gays or lesbians i think they were born that way they can't help it BUT  they can hav a civil union and get the tax benefits marriage is DIFFERENT i mean do you see them calling them selves husband and wife if they are two women no they are "lifepartners" or somethin else great.... ya we live in america we are ENTITLED TO OUR RIGHTS as people who marry heterosexually should they   get that right the gays get a civil union OK sounds GREAT who needs to sign the bill????   and finally my book.... I was reading catcher in the rye now im on to Tom O'brian Tomcat in love.... its a rather racy book as we dicovered on the buss back from st helens!   well i hope everyone has a super day day and remembers "safe sex is no sex and straight marriage is best!"
