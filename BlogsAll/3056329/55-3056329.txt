What's every person here thinking about Clark's party? It'd be cool, and I'll certainly enjoy sending her off. I liked having her as a teacher. I'll miss VA more though (if you're reading Mrs. VA, someone's paying me to say this). It's been great having her two years straight and seeing my writing grow, as well as having her watch the progression and help me through it. I know that there's some of you who've had her for three years and are ready for a new teacher, and I see your point. I find it interesting the difference between last year and this year. It's a difference which struck me when I was looking for stuff to write my PDP's on. I'm glad how she conducted the class this year; it was very worth while.      Poor Alex is right here next to me. It's Clark's 2nd period, and she still can't access either one. I'm guessing that all of you are very ready to just leave. The will to work is leaving, and I really just don't want to do to much. I'm ready to hop that plane to Germany, head off to my summer concerts, not as ready to do side work (but will somehow), and just slide into next year. It won't be so easy, especially all this college stuff, but I'm ready to start anew with senior year. I really just want to throw away all the college stuff that isn't Washington; I'm not really interested in leaving the state, and I'm even less interested now. It's not smart to trash the stuff yet, but sometimes I don't want to be smart.      Anywho, I'm going to check scholarships or the US blog. Till next time - Adios and God bless.  Tristan
