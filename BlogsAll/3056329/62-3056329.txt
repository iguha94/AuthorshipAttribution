Gosh, I remember JNCO's.  4th grade, had to get me a pair, couldn't afford it, I was a very sad little boy.  I remember them having innovative tee-shirts too.  Amazing how everything changes, since I don't think any of us would go near JNCO's now.  Are they even still around?  I think your skyview votes for the vote idea is very innovative, it's the kind of idealistic idea I'd expect to read about in Newsweek or something...  Oh the possibilities.  Is anybody else having trouble focusing their energy.  We have work in this class, clarks(somewhat), and my math class.  But everything else, especially my 3rd and 4th periods, are nothing.  It's really hard to keep a work minded mind not having to do any work.  I love summer, but I hate the mindless feeling I get from it.  I always like to have my energy focused on something.  I think I'm going to end up being one of those guys who can't bring themselves to retire, and when they have to they hate it and go back to work after 8 months.  Closing note, Ma$e- bling bling- is back.  Everyone needs to go listen to 'Welcome Back', who else can you see sampling the welcome back kotter song?  It's actually very good, and he hasn't given up on his preaching, which is cool.  But it's definately a break from the all the mindless club music I hear all the time now.
