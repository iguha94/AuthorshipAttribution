I was reading the free response essays and scoring commentaries that Thomas posted a link to and I just had a revelation: there is a purpose to SOAPS! No really, most people that got 9s or 8s used the SOAPS method, they talked about the subject (themes and ideas), occasion for the writer to write addressing this subject(s), audience whom he/she addressed, what purpose the author had when writing this piece and style of the writing including tone and rhetorical strategies. Now after two years of thinking that soaps is a waste of time I finally come to a conclusion that it is really the best way to organize your thinking and to make sure that you include everything in your essay in order to score all the possible "points." I tend to just randomly name facts as I go, mentioning the style, occasion and everything in a mix, but I think putting info in a coherent and organized manner will show the scoring person that you actually know what you are talking about, you can express in a very erudite and orderly manner and you are not just brain- storming. So my another suggestion is practice soaps, just look at some of the essay prompts on the link Thomas gave us and as you read each one of them jot down just a couple of words for SOAPS that you think you might have used if you were writing the essays at the exam.  Or better yet, relax and forget all about the test until 7:30 on Monday morning:)
