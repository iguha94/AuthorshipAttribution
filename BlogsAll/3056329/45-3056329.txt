I personally think everyone should congratulate Rob for his 2nd place at MUN this Saturday! He really did a  great job and it is thanx to him that our team got all the first places:) And I invite everyone to join our club, you never know what hidden talents you have.   Going on to Gatsby, I see the irony of Gatsby's "friends" not even coming to his funeral and the fact that his beloved Daisy runs off and he has to pay for her mistake with his own life. The scenes of the party in his house are truly what the 20s were like for the elite and give me just a general visual of pigs partying in dirt, a feeling of disgust. Also disturbing is the fact that Tom's mistress Myrtle is like that puppy he bought for her on the street, and that he can throw her away as easily as that puppy. I loved the description of women of that time as elegant and mysterious which then created a special contrast with their greed for money and superficial expression of love. I mean I see a lot of themes going on in the book and they are quite obviously related to materialism, but it feels like there is something missing in it, like it's too easy or maybe I just expected too much from the book after hearing all these great things about it. I liked the book, but I don't feel like it changed my life or like it is a masterpiece of literature.
