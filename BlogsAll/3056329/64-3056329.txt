Maybe it's because it's one in the morning, but I had a thought that intrigued me a lot.  I was thinking a little bit about how representative the ASB is of the studentsâ€” and it's basically trust on behalf of the student body that gives the governing body "artistic license" to run the school as it sees fit.  There are no referendums, and although meetings are open to the entire student body to sit in on, nobody ever does, or probably even knows it's an option.  In an effort to make my presidency more directly representative as well as continue my theme of the importance of democratic participation, I would like to have the school vote on how I should vote in the elections held this November.  It would be one vote representing the entire school, and it would sacrifice my own voice, but I think mock campaigning in school for candidates at all government levels would expand the knowledge and interest in politcs of the school: a heritage that would be far more valuable than the vote I would cast on my own.  With a fervor that hinges on administrative support, I would like to pursue this concept.  What does everyone think?  I want comments from both students and their parents on this one.  But not Mike Rush, he is an ignorant Pig-Dog who deserves no respect from anyone.  (Mike demanded I begin trash talking on the blog).  Secondly, I want to organize a large-scale trivial pursuit contest- who would be down to participate?  Trivial Pursuit will be the next big thing in this school and nobody wants to miss out on this.  May democracy live long and prosper.  Love Rob  P.S.  Create Blogger profiles, they are kinda fun to do and give ME something to look at when I'm insomniacing
