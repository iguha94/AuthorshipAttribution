I don't know why we can't change peoples' feelings or beliefs.  I think we have to.  I believe it was MLK that said "we can't stop people from hating us, but we can make laws that makes it illegal to lynch us."  The change has to start somewhere, and protecting homosexual rights in the courts is the first step towards their universal acceptance.  (Ferg is gonna hate me for this but) Take the Civil War for example.  The 13th ammendment freed the slaves, the 14th protected them in the courts, the 15th let them vote.   Although gays haven't been forced into labor and don't need emancipation, the next step is to protect their rights.  Last year there were 2051 reported hate crimes based on sexual preference, up 8% from the number in 2002.  Along with protecting gay civil rights, the advancement of homosexuals will hopefully reduce the very negative anti-gay sentiment (whether conscious or not) in this country.  Kolk, you give me a good reason why gays don't have the right to marry and I'll either tell you why you're wrong, or apologize profusely.  Everyone is "different."  Why limit marriage requirements to what is done in the bedroom?  Without getting naughty, there are plenty of crazy ass things done in the bedroom besides same sex interaction.  Plain and simple, civil unions divide the society over reasons the majority of the posters find unworthy of debate.  I also want comments on the article by Andrew Sullivan- a homosexual republican.
