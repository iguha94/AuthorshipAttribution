I spent the entire weekend basically watching Godfather, and thus coming to a conclusion that I am in love with Al Pacino and that therefore I shall go to a cloister unless I meet a prince on a white horse who will be an identical twin of Al, but preferably a couple of years younger (about 40...). Al Pacino is the greatest actor in the history of man and is a true inspiration. After watching the first two movies I was going to resign as the KGB princess sure that my destiny is to become a mafia godmother, but with all my regret I have to admit that the third movie sort of disillusioned me with the tragic life of mafiosi families, so thus I decided to stay in KGB for a while and then maybe go to a monastery once I am too old to search for my prince Al Pacino's YoungerTwin:( Anyway I encourage all of you who have not seen the movie to see it, believe me that you shall not regret the nine hours of your life spent to see the greatest classic of all time.  I saw HP3 this weekend also and I have to admit that I was very impressed with the new director and that I actually really liked the movie unlike that first two:) I agree with Rob that the movie's main improvement was that it was fast, entertaining and much more like the book. I couldn't believe that it was over so fast though, I want more now:) I think we should open a club in our school, called something like "HP Nerds, Unite!":)
