Just looking back at this year all I can say is that it flew by fast, way too fast to even realize that the junior year is gone... well almost gone. I think senior year will go by even faster, the more you have going on in your life the faster it seems to flow, every day is inundated with just ... life! I just have this analogy in my head: h.s. is like our salmon creek, college is like an Amazon, and after that it's an ocean, and hopefully you get into the warm current;) I am personally looking forward to the end of h.s., I just want to go out into "real" life and be sort of extricated from the feeling of being trapped in this tiny box, cause life just has so much more volume to it than we can actually see right now. I think college should be awesome, better classes, more people to meet, better professors, just feeling like you are your own person and you can do anything you want with your life. Actually when I was at Stanford our tour guide told us that students there can get as drunk as they want and have as many parties as they want as long as they don't bother anyone and don't get out of the dormitories, I think that's in a way a safer way to drink if you do drink than going out to the woods "camping." I missed the accident scene yesterday and the assembly today, but I also would like to think VA for talking to us about this issue today, it just makes it so much more personal and real when you talk about it, and I love it how our teacher actually cares about us. Really, thank you.
