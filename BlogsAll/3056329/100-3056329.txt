I was pretty happy with the way the debate went of Friday too, except, unlike the ones everyone else has posted about, mine got pretty heated, and for the first time, I was probably one of the quietest people in the group! But, while I was preparing for the debate, I talked to some of my senior friends about the issue, and i asked them if they knew anything about it. I was surprised to find that most of them didn't have a clue what the difference is between the two party's economic policies...they didn't even care! I was surprised b/c the elections are coming up quickly. You'd think that people would want to know about the policies that each party is proposing so they could make an educated decision and vote for the party they relate most with. I mean, I guess it makes sense though. The policies on gay marriage and the war in Iraq are getting so much more media attention. How are people supposed to know what the different parties are proposing unless they are given that information on the news or on the front page of the newspaper? Which is kind of interesting to think about: why dont the parties make their economic policies easier for the public to get a hold of? Do they really expect Americans to go searching for the information...NO! Please, we are all so lazy (I'm making a huge generalization here) that we want the information fed to us through television and bullet points. We dont want to take the time out of our busy schedules to find all the different policies out. I guess it's just a little something to think about...why are gay rights and the war getting more attention than an issue that directly affects every single American?
