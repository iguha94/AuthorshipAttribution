Hey!  I thought that our debate in 2nd period went really well.  For someone in 6th period, did you guys break up into little groups, or did you all debate it in one big group?  We formed two groups, with one watching and the other debating, and it went pretty well.  But it was hard, because we all wanted to hear everyone's ideas, but with so many people and only 45 minutes, most of us only got to talk once.    The MUN kids in our class are INSANE, spouting off random facts that are somehow relevant to what we're discussing.  If only we were all that smart...but, I've gotta be honest Thomas (and don't get heated), but I think that your issue on abortion in 3rd World Countries belongs in a completely different discussion.  Maybe I just don't know enough about Bush's policy, but I don't see how that effects the subject of our discussion on Friday.    And, for those of you who think that morals shouldn't be involved in deciding whether abortion should be legalized or not, I think that's impossible.  For example, I believe that no baby should be killed, but that if the mother has no way of taking care of the baby, that adoption is the best thing for it.  But someone else will feel differently, that the fetus isn't yet a person or that the mother has the right to kill or keep her baby.  That's a difference in morals and personal beliefs.  There's no way to take a stand on an issue like this without including your own morals.  Issues like abortion and gay marriage are built completely on personal opinions and cannot be decided in any other way.  PS  I'm not anti-choice, I'm anti-death! :)  See you all on Monday.  Bethany
