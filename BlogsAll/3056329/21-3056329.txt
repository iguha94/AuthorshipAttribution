Paul, thanks for bringing up the nature of other categories of national literature.  Last year we had a much more cosmopolitan curriculum, and thinking back to Dr. Zhivago, I have to agree with Natalya on the desolation that Pasternak wrote about.  We read about Okonkwo too, and the let down he obviously felt when his tribe was weakening.  We also have read some western European novels and essays- Tale of Two Cities, All Quiet on the Western Front, et al.  Tale of Two Cities was really a political observation where personal relationships just worked themselves out, and All Quiet addressed the feeling of hopelessness war carries.  America truly is unique that it hasn't had to experience the despariging wars (other than Civil War) that Europe and Asia have dealt with, and that's the best evidence I can uncover to explain the difference in literary themes.  Many people in the world view Americans as arrogant and possessing other undesirable characteristics.  Does the attitude that we can do it on our own come through in the lit?  Or do Americans just lust for heros?  I find this all very interesting.  Maybe Tristan will tell me what I want to hear.  Shifting gears, what did you all think of the in-class essay today?  I enjoyed it, but being a dick, I could swear that passage came out of Disability.  No matter how strong Mairs portrays herself, you can still see her pain in the words she uses.  Lastly, in his press conference, Bush claimed he couldn't think of a mistake he's made in office.  You have to respect the guy a smidge for believing in himself, but I'd like to make a list of mistakes he's made.  Ignoring all his verbal blunders, I'll start the list off with the suggestion that Saddam and Al Qaeda were linked, last time I checked it was a lie, and it got Clinton impeached (which he deserved).  If anyone's got an item to add, please post it.  Love Rob
