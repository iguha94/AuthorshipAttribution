Isn't it a sad state that the Fascist National forces won the Spanish Civil War? The Loyalists, being the Republican-elected govt., get supported by only Mexico and the USSR, while the US, Britain, and France keep their sympathies at home. I applaud those who went over to aid the Loyalists. I have yet to read much lit on this period (Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell Tolls" is now on my shelf, unread, but certainly on deck). George Orwell's "Homage to Catalonia" would be good too. I read a short, interesting excerpt from it where Orwell described himself meeting an Italian peasant. A communist soldier, a simple man, and one fighting against the government of his country to fight for his beliefs. It was interesting to consider that even some Germans and Italians, whose governments were supporting Franco's Nationalist rebellion, were joining the Loyalists to fight the spread of Fascism. It's like the Domino Effect theory in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, but also like the end of that conflict, the "villanous" form of govt. fought against (Communist) didn't spread beyond far beyond Vietnam. Anywho, and the lack of help from democracies causes the Republican collapse, and Franco's brutal reign goes from 1939-1975; 36 years! Gee, and the policies of neutrality and appeasement certainly didn't help in Spain, or in Czechoslovakia for that matter. Or in Poland, etc. "It just goes on and on and on."    Does anyone need an extra id partner. I'm trying to get an exchange going for this new test. Anywho, see you all later, hopefully. I'd like to see what you think on this above blurb. Didn't the quote before signing into this thing say "for people who have lots to say"? Goodbye all. Adios and God bless you.                                                             Yeehawman,                                                               (Tristan)
