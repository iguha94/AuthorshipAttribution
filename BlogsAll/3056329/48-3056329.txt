I just got back from the Talent Show and I was really impressed by the last song by the White Bros, piano and violin really made it just ... special, so props for Ben Perry and Matt Wu. Sorry Rob, but Matt WU is way hotter than Thomas, although I have to agree that Thomas by all parameters is qualified for the title of a hottie.  I just finished "The Great Gatsby" today and I have kind of mixed feelings toward the book. I have heard a lot of people say good things about it and on the back of the book it says "American masterpiece" but my question is: what is the point of the book? I just feel dumb right now cause I didn't really find an actual point, or an underlined message or some "truth" or a "revelation." The book was really well written and was engaging, I thought it was great from the very beginning, but I somehow expected more from it and I guess the end just threw me off, as if Fitzgerald just left the book unfinished. I didn't even get it first that the last page I read was the last page of the book, I expected a "to be continued..." So I am really looking forward to a discussion of the book as soon as everyone has finished it, meanwhile Catcher in the Rye seems quite interesting, I like its colloquial style and a somewhat humorous tone, the author is great in his ability to delineate a very vivid and a realistic picture of this boy, I like the beginning: "I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything. I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened..." a nice start for the book, sort of sets you up in the right mood ... enjoy the show ... .
