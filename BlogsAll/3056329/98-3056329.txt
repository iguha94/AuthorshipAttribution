My little dumplings...thank you so much for the nice send off.  I am so sorry I added to your anxiety and stress by not showing up on Thursday...Whoops!  I am very touched by your kind words and actions. I have the poster hanging in my condo amongst the boxes. I can honestly say I have never come across a more  caring and intelligent group of students.  I wish you the best of success in your senior year and your life.  The hardest part of this transition is saying goodbye to the students.  (I have teared more than once thinking about it.) You are truly amazing.  Please keep me posted on your life, college choices, etc.   You can reach me in July at sjclark68@hotmail.com or use the Shorecrest website...I will have an email account set up there soon.  I start work on Monday.  (Yikes)  I would love to hear how you did on the AP test...remember it is a tough test and your score may not always reflect what you have learned or know.  It is one test.    Last night I was watching 60 minutes...did anyone else see the Clinton interview?  What did you think...do you hate him or love him...how do you feel about the right wing conspiracy? Will he be able to live down the impeachment trial...was the impeachment fair?  It is odd...the last couple of weeks have focused on celebrating the Republican agenda in remembering Ronald Reagan...now Clinton's book and Farehneit 911 is coming out...there should be some interesting debates and discussions to blog about.  I do like what Clinton said about hate...there is no reason to hate a political figure but be able to disagree with their stance and opinion.   Thomas...I hope you are having a good time in Seattle.    Keep on blogging...I would also love to hear about the trips to Germany, China, and Georgetown...  Love ya, Ms. Clark,
