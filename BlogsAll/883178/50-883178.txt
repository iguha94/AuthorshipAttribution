F It...It's the Friday Five!   1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?    I like novels and admittedly, I read mostly fiction.  I tend to stay away from newspapers and magazines of substance because I like to stay pleasantly uninformed.  Turns out, I'm not missing much.   2. What is your favorite novel?  My favorite novel?  That's a tough one.  I guess I'll just list SOME of my favorite novels.  I really liked Stephen King's  'Misery.'   It was a bajillion times better than that pathetic movie they made with Kate Bates and Jim Caan.  The movie was Candyland in comparison.  (ooooh...big revelation, the book was better.)  I also like the book  'Filth'  by Irvine Welsh quite a bit.  Then again, I like just about everything that gadge writes.  This is a hard question to answer...it's kind of like asking me what my favorite movie is.   3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  It's too long to write, but it's  The Cremation of Sam McGee.   You can read it   here .  I've never been a big poetry buff, but the ones I really tend to like are ones with a story.  Call me a simpleton, but I'm a sucker for a clever tale...    4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  Either the Bible or Dianetics, though I probably never will.  I really want to see what all these religious kooks are making such a big fuss about.  Plus, I want to read about Scientology so I can make fun of it and not feel so guilty.   5. What are you currently reading?  Right now, I'm reading a children's novel by Cornelia Funke called  'The Thief Lord.'   It's pretty good.  Supposedly, she's like almost as popular as JK Rowling in other parts of the world.  I'll probably finish it this weekend and prepare myself for  'The Return of the King.'
