A Little Better...The Friday 5 Presented in DJS Stereo     1. If you had the chance to meet someone you've never met, from the past or present, who would it be?  I'd like to meet my great great grandpa, the guy who is the reason I have the middle name I've got.  He looked like a interesting old guy who wore bib overalls, had a dog named Tippy and spent hours and hours whittling pieces of wood into chains and fans and other useless items.  I've got an old newspaper article that he was featured in and he didn't even bother to look up at the camera, he's just sitting in his old chair, Tippy at his feet, working his pocket knife into the wood.  Before the big battle my family endured at the hands of my e-vil grandma, my parents secured me a relic from my great grandpa's past.  It's an old wind-up watch some girlfriend gave him back in the olden days.  So cool.  The amazing thing is, it still works.   2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be?  Future.  Definitely future.  I'd be too afraid to go into the past a la Marty McFly and wreck too much shit in the present.   Plus, I'm all about technology.  I want to ride in cars that'll fold up into my suitcase, and had a robot maid picking up after me.  Plus, not having to cook when you want a delicious meal?  Sign me up for that.   3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be?  It would be home.  I'm tired of being at work.   4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be?  Indiana Jones...no wait, Darth Vader, no...scratch that...I'd want to be Gollum.  Er, on second thought...how about Oprah?  That way I'd throw myself off of a bridge and do the world a favor.   5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be?  Probably George Clooney's.  I was going to say Sloth from 'The Goonies' but I figured that would get old real quick.
