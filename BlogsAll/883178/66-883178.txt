A Short Commentary on Thongs: Pros & Cons   Pros:  1) Thongs are great if it's Saturday night and you feel like wearing that kicky pair of tight black pants and you want to avoid the dreaded "underwear line". (HAL, there's no way you're getting me to use the P-word.) 2) Guys love them...they just do.  Wear one, and certain guys may just buy you a car...or at least a bus pass.  Cons: 1) They are so fricking uncomfortable.  I don't care what certain girls say..."You just have to get used to them, and then you'll never even feel them!"  You people are liars, because I think I would no longer be human if I suddenly became "comfortable" with something lodged up my butt crack.  But Dirty may disagree - refer to his latest post. 2) Some girls always have them sticking out of their pants.  (Celebrity sightings: Britney and Christina) Two words, DJS: low class.  My coworker, Thong, has her's practically up to the middle of her back...what the hell is that?  Can she not feel it?  Once I actually commented: "Um, Thong, your underwear is sticking WAY out..."  (I've never been accused of having filters, you know.)  Her response?  "Oh, my red ones!  You like them?"  Are you kidding?  No, dumbass, I wasn't  complimenting  them, I was telling you you're a white trash whore.    How can I make this any clearer?
