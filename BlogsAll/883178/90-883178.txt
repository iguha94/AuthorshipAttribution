1. Do you like talking on the phone? Why or why not?   I would kill a good, kind and gentle man if it cut my phone time in half.     2. Who is the last person you talked to on the phone?   The Star Tribune called me; they want me to up my service.  I said "how did you get my work number?" then hung up.  Was that rude?   3. About how many telephones do you have at home?   Two cordless; two cell. (Don't hate).   4. Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened?   I used to work for a U.S.S. who is a great guy and is now a Washington player.  When he was done talking, he would just hang up.  No hate intended, but rude city baby.  I said nothing to him about it (hello, I was an intern), but others worked on him a great deal.   5. Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not?   I would rather e-mail.  Although, sometimes the phone call cannot be replaced - people don't always understand your mood and meaning in writing.  The Friday Five is about to get kicked to the kurb.  We may have to make our own if they don't shape up really quick like.
