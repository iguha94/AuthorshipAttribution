Friday Five, Y'all...Friday Five, Y'all...Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday Five, Y'all:     1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?   Aquaman.  He could talk to the animals, and he could swim like a darn dolphin.  He had a great looking butt.  He was the complete package.    2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?   Affection.  Just kidding.  I'd have to say go-cart, Bob.  A go cart or affection.  Yep.    3. What's the furthest from home you've been?   Where ever I go, I take Kansas with me.  I'm never away from home, y'all (there's no place like it...it's where the heart is...it's sweet home...it's on the range where the deer and the antelope play).    4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?   Empathy.  But idiots and their idiotic decisions make it so flippin' hard.  Look, morons, get a clue!  Everytime I try walking a mile in someone else's shoes, I just wonder why people don't drive more.  Friggin' morons!    5. What are your plans for the weekend?    [Okay, Friday Five is getting kind of lame and redundant.  We might have to make up our own if this shit keeps up:]  To mourn the absence of football with DJS, (you feelin' me, Shov'?), then to shovel, strategize, sing,  sleep , scramble and start sip-sip trainin' for Panda's visit (jig judge Gino, where you at?).  Why do you ask?
