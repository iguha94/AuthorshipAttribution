Bored at Work, Why Not.    1. If you had the chance to meet someone you've never met, from the past or present, who would it be?  Bono.  I think I would weep.      2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be?   I’m pretty content with this century, although I think everything (including movies, music, commercials, magazines, TV shows) is way too oversexed.  I’m no prude, but what happened to mystery or intrigue?  Britney Spears exposes her underwear for the world to see.  Kids are getting the wrong ideas.  Ricki Lake makes me sick.  Times Square is filled with 100-feet-tall pictures of half naked men and women.  If I could pick a  decade  to grow up in, it would be the late 50’s/early 60’s. Things seemed to have been simpler…people had different (perhaps better) values…quality was more important than quantity…hope was there…no one knew what AIDS was…”mixers” weren’t geeky…people visited or called instead of e-mailed…girls wore pink.     3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be?    Having done a bit of international travel, if I lived anywhere other than the US, I think I would really miss my creature comforts.  I took baths for 4 months straight when I lived in London, and let me tell you, I was dying for a “power shower” after just a week.  Soaking in your own filth is not that romantic.  Plus, I really like central air and dislike bugs. Otherwise I’d live in Thailand.  Living on a tropical island may sound nice, but I would definitely get sunburned.  Yep, I’m sticking to the US of A.   4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be?  Kelly Kapowski because she was the head cheerleader and got to date Zack Morris.    5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be?  Gwenyth Paltrow – her face can light up a room.
