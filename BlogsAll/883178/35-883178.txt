Okay...now the gloves are coming off.   Bono:  an egomaniac who seems to be pulling out all stops to get himself a Nobel Peace Prize and also the a-hole at one time who said something to the effect of: "F the fans...we're not playing our old stuff anymore" all the while trying to cram Pop Mart and Zoo TV garbage down people's throat.   Bjork:  a musical genius.  Is her stuff as catchy as U2's?  No, nor does it need to be.  With every song she's ever recorded, she comes up with a completely distinct and different sound than her previous efforts.  As for the easy cheap shot EVERYONE makes about the swan dress, here's what I have to say: How dare she wear anything other than Prada or a Bob Mackie dress?  This was the   OSCARS   we're talking about!  Ugh!  On a red carpet full of people spinning around to show off their $50,000 dollar dresses that designers gave to them to wear, Bjork showed up in a dress her friend made and was pretty funny about it.  Of course, she didn't expect the backlash she got from the press and every other automoton that watched the awards.  Her response to it all?  She wore it again (how dare she!) on the cover of her album 'Vespertine.'  Tre cool in my book.  Okay...I can see this escalating in an all-out Pandyland brawl.  For the record, I like some of U2's music and I actually think Bono is okay.  I merely pointed out what I thought was a very corny little statement on his part.  I appreciate what he's trying to do, but he needs to stop acting like he's Jesus Christ with his prophetic words of wisdom.  All in all, it's hard to call Bono an artist.  He's a guy with a microphone and an agenda.
