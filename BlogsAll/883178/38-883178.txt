I like Fridays.     1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?    Definitely Wonder Woman. I was so jealous of the next door neighbor with the Wonder Woman underoos. She got to wear a fancy tiara and bracelets and flashy clothes, and was tough and fought crime at the same time.    2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?    Makeup. For Christmas I always wanted makeup or hair accessories or stuff like that, but girliness wasn't completely encouraged in my family. I am just now coming out of my girly-repression funk. And spending a lot of money on nail polish.    3. What's the furthest from home you've been?   I spent Christmas with a bunch of Italian people one year, and was very homesick. Only one or two of the people spoke English - so even though the others were trying to be nice and talk to me, I couldn't understand what they were saying. Then my family called, and they were all together and sounding like they were having fun (and speaking in my own language). I was lonesome...in a crowd...very sad...    4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?    Spanish. I took it in high school, and wish I had continued in college. Instead, I wasted my time on things like Economics and Accounting. I wouldn't have been able to go on the London Business Semester with Panda though, if I hadn't minored in business...    5. What are your plans for the weekend?    Tomorrow I get to go to my boyfriend's holiday party for work. It goes from 5 pm to midnight, and there is a dance...I think I will be tired when it is done. On Sunday we'll go to my niece's 2nd birthday party. And on Monday we're playing hooky and doing fun stuff all day instead of working. I like him...  So, Duf, where does the Friday Five come from?
