1. What is your most prized material possession?  I have a copy of “The Prophet” by Kahlil Gibran that my mother gave to my father (may he rest in peace) when they were dating.  I would say if I had to grab one THING in the event of a fire, that would be it.   2. What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?  This is a bizarre thing about me, but I really don’t have a lot of my old stuff.  Much of it is still stored at dear old mom’s, and much of that has been thrown away.  So, I would say that thing I own that I have had the longest is “The Prophet.”    3. Are you a packrat?  In a way.  I have a hard time discarding magazines.  I have too many CDs and books, but other than that, it all must go.  Although, like Panda, I likes my photos too.   4. Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?  I really like a clean house.  But, like most men, I really hate what you have to do to have one.  When I lived alone, my space was always spotless.  We have a maid now (don't hate) and that helps, but our house is too small for the stuff we have, so clutter is an issue.  When we have adequate storage space, we will be much better off.     5. Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?  Themes:  "Damn dees people po’."  "Please God paint me."  And:  "Hand it on down, we'll take it!"
