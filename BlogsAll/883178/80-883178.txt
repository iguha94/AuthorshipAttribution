What is your favorite Tom Cruise movie?  Why?   That's a tough one.  I haven't seen many Tommy Cruise movies that I haven't liked.  I'm with Duf on this one.  He's vastly under-appreciated and he really knows how to pick roles.  I did get pissed at him for a while for choosing similiar roles/vehicles.  "Days of Thunder" was "Top Gun" on wheels down to the put-on-the-brakes-so-we-can-get-the-upper-hand move.  But if I were to pick just one, I'd have to go with "Cocktail."  Yes it was cheesy.  Yes it was just a plain ol' dumb movie, but it reminds me of my days as an Usher at Apache 6 theatres.  I had it timed so I could 'check' the theatre during the waterfall scene.  Elizabeth Shue.  Delish!  Plus, who can resist the killer soundtrack (Kokomo, Don't Worry Be Happy) and how they flip all those bottles around?     Close favorites:  Born on the Fourth of July, MI:2, Jerry McGuire    What is your favorite Julia Roberts movie?  Why?   Oh...you mean 'Horse-Faced Julia Roberts?'  Easy.  "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" which was a horseshit film.  Why is it my favorite?  Because she gets killed in the movie.  Sorry if I ruined it, but I've actually saved you some time and money.  Seriously.  Spend your money on something else.  You can thank me later.
