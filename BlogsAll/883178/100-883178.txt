Kellogg's sent me a quick response.  Thanks, Rosemary:   Thank you for contacting us about your suggestion for Kellogg's(R)Special K(R)Red Berries. While your idea is not new to us, we appreciate your interest and the time you took to submit this idea.  Our company devotes a great deal of time and effort to developing new and improved products, packaging concepts, promotions and merchandising ideas, such as recipe ideas and alternate serving suggestions, to make our products the best on the market.  When this product was first produced Kellogg Company tried different fruit additions.  From the information we have received the name originated because there were more than strawberries added.  Due to consumer review strawberries were chosen as the only fruit to be added.  We are happy that you are enjoying the product.  Again, thank you for contacting us; we appreciate your interest in our company and products.  Rosemary Consumer Affairs Department   On the bottom of Rosemary's very unremarkable retort, there was a push to remember to eat breakfast...   National School Breakfast Week is the perfect time to remind parents of the importance of eating a good breakfast.  Findings from studies conducted by nutrition research organizations continue to support the fact that children who eat breakfast do better academically and behave better in school than those who do not.  The key reason...not eating breakfast means that blood sugar levels remain too low to allow for proper concentration.  Adults can suffer the same problems when they skip breakfast.  So, remember to treat your children...and yourself...to a nutritious breakfast each and every day.  Our cereals and meal-on-the-go products can help!

My brother always ate breakfast when we were growing up and that never made him "behave better."  What a crock.
