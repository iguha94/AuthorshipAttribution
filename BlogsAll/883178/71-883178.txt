Having spent the past weekend in a small town, I can safely say this: I enjoy the scenery of a small town, but there's no way in Christ Jesus's name our Lord, amen will I ever live in one.  DJ LZ's sister and bro-in-law moved to a small, small town south of the cities where he's planning on opening a landscaping business.  They got the opportunity to buy his uncle's house and live there for cheaper.  Newer house...big, out in the country.  Oh, but there's a catch or two:   1.  Grandma lives on the property too.  Her house, and I'm not shitting you, is 50 yards away.  If you're bumpin' uglies and the windows are open, ol' granny is going to see all of the action.   Not only does Gramma live close-by, their next closest neighbors are the bro-in-law's parents!  Further down?  Yep, you guessed it...another uncle.  Hey I love my family as much as the next guy, but there's no way I'm living in their goddamn backyard.   2.  Dirt driveway.  It's a regular Dukes of Hazzard thing going on.  I guess concrete is too darn expensive, so they'll just pull the General Lee up and hop out through the windows.  Like DJ LZ, her sister is a bit of a neat freak.  Good luck with that...everytime someone pulls up to the house, it's going to look like Pig Pen from the Peanuts Gang bumrushed the place.   3.  Local bar: The Town Pump.  I'm not kidding.  We popped in for a beer and there were signs hung strategically near the doors that read: 'Anyone fighting will be ejected for 30 days.'  That's nice.  Since there aren't a whole lot of people who can frequent the place, they can't really kick anyone out for good.  It's kind of like a penalty box for country hicks.
