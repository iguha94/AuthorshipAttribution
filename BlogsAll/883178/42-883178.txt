The At Least It's Not Wednesday Yet Five:    1. What is the one thing you don't like about your body?  I wish I were a little more fit. I still think of myself as an athlete (because of high school and college) and thus being able to eat as much as I want whenever I want, but am pretty much a lazy bum these days.   2. What are two things you love about your body?   I have plenty of thick, healthy hair on my head - without having thick, unruly hair on my arms or face. Is that two?   3. What are three things you want to change about your home?   I wish it was free. I wish it would clean itself. I wish it was right next door to where Matt lives.    4. What are four books you want to read this year?    You Shall Know Our Velocity  by Dave Eggers, since I got it for Christmas and like the first four pages so far. Also, I'd like to finish reading the other books I purchased last year, such as  The Corrections . I'm looking forward to taking a day off to read the new Harry Potter book non-stop once it comes out. And maybe I should read that cheese book, because I'm unhappy at work.    5. What are five promises you have kept to yourself?   A long time ago, my swimming coach taught me that the only thing in life I truly  have to  do is die (followed up by a conversation about whether you  have to  go to the bathroom or not, or if it will kill you if you don't...but that's a story for another time) so I haven't made many promises to myself. I like the idea though, and intend to make five promises to myself right now.
