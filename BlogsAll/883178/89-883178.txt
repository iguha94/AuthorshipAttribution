Tuesday Two, y'all, Tuesday Two, y'all.  Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday Two y'all!    1. If you could live the life of a famous or successful person for one day, who would it be? Why?    That's easy.  I would be Tiger Woods.  My hope that one day would be long enough for me to pick up some things from his golf swing and groove them into my muscle memory.  I could also know what it feels like to hit a ball 300+ yards and have people stare at me adoringly.   2. What one musical group forces you to change the channel instantly when one of their songs plays on the radio?    For me it's a four-way tie:  Anything by Meatloaf (although he is rarely on the radio anymore), anything by the Violent Femmes (please die "Blister in the Sun", please - it was great the first million times I heard it, and now I absolutely cannot stand it at all, not even a little bit and don't get me started on "Do you like American Music?"  Arrrggghhh!).  That one song by the Suburbs that they play here too much...(when will it die?)...and that is similar to this one other song I destest by the Meat Puppets ("Johnny loves Janie, Janie love Paul womp, womp, womp, womp....).  It's horrible.  Horrible.  I'm upset just thinking about it.  Ick.  Meatloaf fans, let me feel ya'.
