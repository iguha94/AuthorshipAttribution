Wow, Stoner.  That's a weird and creepy story.  Good luck with that new number.  So I've been doing some field research on an oddly fascinating phenomena:   Golden Tee games are almost always right next to the jukebox in a bar.   And this gets me in trouble...mostly because of another fact I've uncovered:   Guys who play Golden Tee are total chachis and have no hope of ever sleeping with a woman.   Last night I was at a local tavern, enjoying some free beers because one of my friends won a free happy hour.  (cha-ching!)  Of course, I made a bee-line to the jukebox in order to dominate the song choices for the evening.  As usual, there were a few frat-boy chachis gathered 'round Golden Tee.  They were all giving each other high fives and other such frat guy behavior.  I was just ignoring them, and picking my usual song favorites.  Then one of these guys decides to be a smart ass and rips on one of my choices...it happened to be a U2 song.    He had no idea what he got himself into.  Even while sober I probably would have let him have it, but since I had a few cocktails by that time, it was no holds barred.  "Hmmm, thanks for sharing your fine opinion on music with me.  Sorry I'm not as cool as you and didn't pick some lame-ass Dave Matthews song.  Oh, and by the way, you've just proved my theory.  Guys who play Golden Tee really don't have a penis.  Thanks!"  Needless to say, he was pissed, but didn't bother me for the rest of the night.  Stupid, stupid boy.
