PB's Thursday 3    If you could be in any branch of the military, which would you choose and why?  When I was 17 and a senior in high school, I went through about a month-long phase where I wanted to join the Marines.  I went on and on about this...I remember vividly.  I was enamored with the uniforms, the challenge, the extreme toughness, the yelling, the fact that most Marines are sick-in-the-head.  When my brother caught wind of my plans, he laughed his ass off, especially because at the time I was about 90 pounds and nowhere close to as tough as I am now.  (I'll kick your ass if you disagree.)  He then challenged me to do 50 push-ups in a row.  I could not do it.  So I changed my mind.    But, to answer the question, I still dream about being a Marine, so that's the branch I would choose now.   What are your comfort foods/guilty pleasures?  I'm with Duf on the donut thing: I love getting 2 Boston Cremes from Dunkin' Donuts (Double Down with the Double D, Hal.).  Especially because I love hearing the Indian guy with his THICK Indian accent say "Yes maam, 2 Boston Cremes." And I like classic, just out of the fryer Krispy Kremes.  I also adore Mac & Cheese.  My guilty pleasure is to read the latest copy of US magazine on my plane rides to and from NYC.  Sometimes I hide it in a copy of Business 2.0 or Smithsonian (sounds like pervy Saddam) just because I am always on business flights and am afraid my fellow passengers will think I'm an airhead.  I can't get enough of the celebrity gossip.  I need serious help.   The thong movement has passed along an overall benefit to American fashion and the appearance of the American fanny. Discuss.  I have discussed the pros and cons of thongs in a previous post.  I work with a girl named Thong who bugs the crap out of me.  I'm through with this topic.
