Two Olives for a Great American   My favorite Senator of all time (yes, even more than Wellstone and even more than Lyndon Johnson), Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, died yesterday.  He was a gentleman, a scholar, and a man who could not be defined by party affiliations (he was a central figure in the Kennedy administration  and  in the Nixon administration for crying out loud).  He wrote 18 books and cared passionately about issues of race, ethnicity and class.  I bet that Panda and I both would find much to admire in his policies (now that's crossover).    When I was an intern in Washington (pause for Monica Lewinsky joke), there were a handful of people that I always wanted to see.  I was there during the Bush administration (pause for second Monica Lewinsky joke) and there were all these famous politicians that I always got a charge out of seeing.  Ted Kennedy was one.  John Kerry was another.  Lowell Weicker, the great Connecticut maverick, was still another (should I have been born in the Northeast?).  The President, of course.  There were others, but none topped Senator Moynihan.  I would sometimes go to finance committee meetings to hear him speak.  I even visited the Senate floor a couple of times to catch his remarks on some piece of legislation or another.  He was the kind of Senator I would want to be if I were one:  an intellectual, independent, a man of ideas and history, a supremely witty wordsmith quick with a bon mot, but perhaps most of all, a man you would want to knock back drinks with.  DPM was a martini drinker, so today, knock one back in his honor.  Make mine with two olives, please.
