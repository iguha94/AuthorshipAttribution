News Flash:   Duf Fer and I just got back from a quick jaunt to Rainbow Foods where I was asked to pick up some treats for a training session.  Wait...you mean I can get out of the office for an additional half hour?  Sold, baby.  So we're listening to the Rolling Stones 2 Disc set we each purchased within the last few days.  At the food depot, we snatch some cupcakes and a nice box of cookies and we're good to go.  On the way out, I head down the pasta aisle.  Why?  Don't know.  I just did...but now, I wonder if it's fate.  On the lower shelf where no one can really see them is the most beautiful value pack this Blogger has ever laid eyes on.  5 boxes of delicious original Kraft Macaroni & Cheese packaged together with a bonus.  What bonus, you ask?  Why...a free E.T. bendable figurine, staring back at us from the cellophane box he's held hostage in.  " Gimme ," I said and scooped it up.  At a price of $3.99 I was more than sold.  At the counter, the lady asked if I had an Easy Save card.  Does the Pope shit in the woods?  Of course I do.  She swiped it and it was as thought the band started playing the parade song early.  Her eyes widened as she told me about the savings I was about to reap.  " This is a good deal ," Linda the Rainbow lady quiped.  " You saved half. "  $2.00???  Yes friends.  Five boxes of deliciousness and a little brown friend to keep you company.  Life is good.  So good in fact that Duf ran back down the aisle and fetched a Blue Box Value Pack for himself.  As he was checking out, I spied the offer on the back of the boxes.  For a mere $14.99, you can have you child's picture put onto a box of macaroni & cheese, right below the banner that says "The Cheesiest."  Now, I don't have any kids, but...well, let's say I've spent my money in worse ways.  Sold!  P.S. I'm anxious as all get out for the Pandyland Jamboree tonight.  Gonna rock this town...  (I'm so excited, I'm posting this on Soft Drink, too.)
