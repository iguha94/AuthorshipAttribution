I had to change my cell phone number today.    Since I got it in late December, I’ve gotten about two “no number” calls a day – they never leave messages. I assumed it would taper off as people realized that I’m not the person they’re looking for. Twice, I’ve gotten messages from the parents of a girl named Amber, asking her to call home. I don’t know the number for home, so can’t call them back to tell them I’m not Amber.   After my vacation, I had a message from a woman named Sharon. She didn’t give me the reason for her call, she just sounded very professional and left an 800 number. I thought my finances were in trouble or something, because she works for some sort of bank. When I spoke with her, she said she found my number in her husband’s wallet. He’s a trucker, and she knows he’s been messing around with hookers – and she assumed I was one of them. We cleared up the confusion when I said I get calls for a guy named Dan and a girl named Amber – apparently the scrap of paper in her hubbie’s wallet said Amber on it.   The last straw, though, came last night. I got a creepy voicemail in a heavily-accented male’s voice that just said “I know who you are…” I decided I didn’t want to know who he was. So I switched it.   I wonder who had my new number last? Hopefully, not another hooker…
