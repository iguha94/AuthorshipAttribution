Okay...so I'm the curmudgeon here.  I can't stand that show.  Like most of TV (and I don't want to get on a rant here) American Idol is totally insulting to my intelligence...you know, 'cuz I'm so smart.  I caught a clip of some of the show when my girlfriend was watching it and there was a segment where it showed 'those wacky kids' having fun between rehearsals.  They were being crazy and trying their hand at playing the trumpet.  Of course, no one was able to blow it and make it work right.  Hilarious!  But then...the idiot with the stupid-looking afro (I think, I forget because they're all talentless) drank some Coca-Cola and was able to belt out a chart-topper.  So stupid.  And another thing...don't speak for the whole of America by calling any of these no talent schleps American Idols.  Let us decide who the damn idols are, okay?  Not just the poor slobs who actually call in to vote for this garbage.  Seriously...would you buy a CD if any of them released something?  I'm sorry, I'd rather spend my hard-earned cash on a pencil.  So I could poke out my eardrums.  (take a breath)  Okay...so I'm crabby today.  I've had to train 6 people who had the attention span of a fat lady in a bakery.  Needless to say, I'm a little burnt out.  Today was a long day.  I guess I hope Kelly wins, alright?  :)
