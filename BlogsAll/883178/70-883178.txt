DJS, I thought your Dukes of Hazard/Peanuts reference was very poetic.    Speaking of family that lives in excessive proximity… my mother comes from a very large family - she was lucky # 13 of the 13 kids my grandparents had.  Her family spent their summers at a house on a lake.  Somewhere between then and now her siblings all found a way to really, really not like each other (I don’t like to say “hate”).  Not to the tune of death threats, but definitely to the tune of lawsuits and other similarly bad behavior.  To illustrate – a few months ago I was asked (in writing) whether or not I would like to sue one of my cousins.  The letter was from one of my uncles (via his attorney), and the entire episode was absolutely non-surprising to me.  I actually took it as a “welcome to the family”-type gesture.   Alright, so back to this lake in western Minnesota where my mother grew up – I swear that ½ the houses on this lake belong to either one of my mother’s siblings, or one of their children (or one of my mother’s cousins, or one of their children).  I go back there and I am continually amazed that all these people who don’t like each other choose to live on top of each other – at a second home, no less!  I mean, it’s a nice spot and all, but there are 10,000 lakes in this great state – why not venture out and make a few new enemies?  And to get into the reason that still visit said lake gets into truly “Dynasty”/”Peyton Place” territory.  Besides, you get the point.  So I’m all for a little distance with family.  On an entirely different note, I saw   this movie  this weekend with Stoner.  It was very feel-good, and chock full of girl-power.  I highly recommend it if you like any of those things.  Or if you like soccer.   Sorry, Duf, I have yet to see   this , but I hope to soon...  Happy Monday, Pandyz.
