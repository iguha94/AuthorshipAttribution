I can't disagree with what people are saying here.  I just have to take small exception with the  claim  that Bono said he won't play old stuff - there's been stuff from "Boy" or "October" (circa '80-'81), at almost all the shows I've been to, and they ALWAYS play stuff from "War" (1983) and every subsequent albumn at every show.  And I certainly don't disagree that Bono is "a guy with a microphone and an agenda", after all, I love that about him.  Same goes with the charge of cheesy-ness.  He's guilty - guilty of being earnest!  Em I buggin' ya?...  I also agree that Bjork was being subversive and rebellious at the Oscars.  No one in their right mind actually thought she put that on thinking "this will fit in with any Vera Wang out there".  But it was a bizarre and flaky thing to do.  I also loved it when the “South Park” guys arrived at the Oscars dressed in J-Lo and Gwyneth dresses.  It was weird and obnoxious.  But I laughed really hard, and it’s the only thing I remember anyone wearing from that year, plus, we're still talking about it, so it was genius.  Bottom line, U2 fans have to live with the fact that Bono can be perceived as pompous, and Bjork is a freak.  But they don’t have to accept those as bad things.   I just hope this doesn't all come down to someone getting booted.  Er, wrong site...
