Down with Biscomerica!   After waiting days for the response to my note to Biscomerica, I got a flat reply.  Here's my note (reprinted):   I just had a bag of Born (and Baked) in the USA snack cookies, and they were delicious.  I actually shared them with some co-workers (keeping my calories down, you know) and we all liked them a lot.  We had a disagreement about whether the hats were separate or if they just broke off from the Uncle Sam cookies.  Could you settle this for us?  I think that the hats come separately.  Also, and this is unrelated, but we were thinking that since America is one nation under God, it might be a good idea to do a line of religious cookies.  We thought you could incorporate some images of our Lord, like Jesus, sandles, fish, wine and a crucifix.  Just an idea. Thanks and best wishes with your cookies.  Now more than ever we need to stay together as a country.   Here is my response from Trixie Fargo (no lie) at Biscomerica:   Thank you for taking the time to contact us!  We are delighted to hear that you enjoy our USA cookies.  The hat should be attached to Uncle Sam, as depicted on the front of the package.  Thank you!  Trixie Fargo   Trixie, you are wrong!  On the front of the package, there is a hat by itself.  Not only that, she completely left out JESUS!  Corporate America:  where's the passion?  I don't feel the passion.
