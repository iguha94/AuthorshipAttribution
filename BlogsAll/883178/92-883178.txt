Why I hate hotel gyms.   I kind of have a little ritual when I'm in NY, particularly when I have no plans in the evening.  I usually try to walk back to my hotel (about a 40-block hike), go to a deli for sushi or the salad bar, order a cheesy romantic comedy on my TV that I'd never pay for with my own money, watch it, and then at about 9pm I'll go to the hotel gym.  I go late because I hate working out when the gym is crowded.    So I was all alone two nights ago, until this short, stocky guy came in to ruin my workout time.  I was on the treadmill, minding my own business and listening to Coldplay (of course), and this guy starts up the treadmill right next to mine.  He had it going the fastest speed possible, and kind of gave me a look like "check  this  out."  I was not impressed.  He was running his little heart out, with me continuing my walk at a normal brisk pace.  I guess I didn't give him enough positive feedback, because he then proceeded to raise the incline.  I swear, I think his treadmill was almost at 90 degrees at one point.  By this time he was completely staring me down, wondering why I wasn't giving him a round of applause.  This totally wigged me out, so I just left.  Then last night, I went down at the same time, started my workout, and who showed up  again ...weirdo runner guy.  He gave me the stare down again, this time with a sly smile and wink that said "I'm blatantly hitting on you"...so then I blatantly went back to my room.  Telling a guy like this off is usually no use.  But if I see him again next week, I'm going to punch him in the neck, or at least give him a piece of my mind.  And since I have longer strides than him, I'll run him into the ground for sure.
