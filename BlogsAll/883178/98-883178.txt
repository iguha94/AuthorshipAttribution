Thanks Hal.  I feel much better.  So I've been thinking about what I should "give up" during the Lenten season.  This is a lot of pressure - I mean, I already have to stop eating meat on Fridays, and then there's the whole Easter Vigil thing on Holy Saturday which is just about the longest mass in existence.  When I still sang in the Cathedral choir, this was the Big One...the one we all dreaded because it meant we had to stand for 3 hours straight.  And we didn't get to stand in the choir loft in back, but smack dab in the front, in front of the entire congregation, sweating to death and feeling like we're all gonna faint.  So, yes, Lent is a lot about sacrifice (considering everything JC did on the cross and all), but why does it have to be?  Instead of "giving something up", I'm going to try and be a better person...at least for 40 days.  How am I going to do that?  Well, I'll start by buying all my friends in Minneapolis a round when I'm in town next week.  And then I'll try not to yell at old ladies in the bus anymore.  And then for the finale, I will make sure to (try) and keep my mouth shut when I see someone dressed like a slut.  It's the least I can do.  In other news, if anyone has been keeping score: Mike Walsh of   "Bowling Roadtrip"  fame, has finished bowling in all 50 states.  He is also the first person in history to have ever bowled in Alaska AND Hawaii  all in the same day .  Congrats Mike and welcome home...and good luck writing the book.
