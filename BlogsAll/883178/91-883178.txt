Are you ready for the WEEKEND?  How about this lame-o Friday Five.   BTW, there are no rules this weekend except ONE: What goes on in the Twin Cities  stays  in the Twin Cities.  That's all I'm sayin'.   1. Do you like talking on the phone? Why or why not?  I like talking on the phone if I have juicy gossip or to plan an event for the weekend.  I usually don't call people just to chat.  Bor-ing.   2. Who is the last person you talked to on the phone?  Kellie - we're excited to get the hell out of dodge and head to God's Country.   3. About how many telephones do you have at home?  One cordless, one cell.  Whatever.   4. Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened?  I absolutely hate people with call-waiting.  When someone says "Hey, can I get this other call?" that basically means "You're not important enough for me to talk to".  I don't ever use the call waiting I have on my cell phone, and I don't have it on my cordless at home.  If someone really needs to get a hold of me and he/she hears a busy signal or gets my voice-mail, the person can call back or leave a message.  C'mon people!   5. Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not?  Depends on the situation.  If I'm dumping a guy, I try to call and let him off easy - it's the least I can do.  But Kellie likes to e-mail guys her "Dear John" letters...she's a bitch like that.
