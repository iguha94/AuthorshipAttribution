Alright jerks.  I don't post for a few days and I get treated like a red-headed step child?  Do I have to start my own blog again?  I'm now in Chicago through Christmas.  It's soooo good to be home.  Although I had a kickin' weekend with my girls over last weekend.  We caught a show on Broadway on Saturday and a cheapskate frat boy on Friday.  That's right...the same one I talked about a few weeks ago.  Believe me, it wasn't my idea...it's my friend who's a glutton for punishment.  Don't even get me started about the cheap-ass moves this clown pulled. (i.e., ordering 2 bottles of the most expensive wine in the restaurant, only to make us pay for it when the bill came.)   So Billygoat was robbed in Guatemala today.  To directly quote his e-mail to me: "A German guy and I got robbed today as we walked the shores of lake Atitlan. There were 3 14 year old kids with machetes. Unfortunately I lost my camera and a completed roll of film. The police came minutes later and tried to catch the thieves but the kids were faster.  I didn't lose much else or get hurt so don't worry. I am safely in Panajachel now. My passport was safe in the secret pocket."  And to think I was going to travel with him for 6 months?  Blatant evidence that everything happens for a reason.
