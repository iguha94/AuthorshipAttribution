First off, welcome back, Stoner!    Second off, here's my F5 on a Monday...    1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?   I'm always reading something, but the bulk of it is newspapers and magazines.  My favorite newspapers are the NY Times and the StarTribune.  My favorite magazine is Vanity Fair, and Entertainment Weekly is something I'll eventually have to wean myself off of.  I also like reading both novels and non-fiction books.   2. What is your favorite novel?  My two all time faves are “The Great Gatsby” by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and “Life After God” by Douglas Coupland (though I don’t think this one is technically a novel).  I also have to site “To Kill A Mockingbird” by Harper Lee as a sentimental favorite – Ms. Tyson read it to us in seventh grade, and it taught me that books read in school can be cool.   3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  Okay, it’s not exotic, and probably says more about the fact that I saw “The Outsiders” at an impressionable time in my life than anything else… but here goes:  Nature’s first green is gold Her hardest hue to hold Her early leaf’s a flower; But only so an hour Then leaf subsides to leaf So Eden sank to grief So dawn goes down to day Nothing gold can stay   4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  I’m a slow reader… and I have to have great interest in anything to read it, so I have a pile of books that I swear I’ll get to but I never will, and books that I made it 1/2 way through, and I swear I'll complete.   5. What are you currently reading?  “Tender Is The Night” by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  I told CK2 how much I liked “The Great Gatsby” and she told me that I would like “TITN” even better.  So I’m being obedient.  I just started it, so it’s too early to tell if it’s as good.   Third off, I'm in a ridiculously good mood this morning... I don't know why.  It is Monday, fer chrissakes...
