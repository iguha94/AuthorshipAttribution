First off:  Edgeville Rocks.  Second of all, this is the toughest [Monday] Five ever.   1.  What is the one thing you don't like about your body?   Easy:  my weight.  So sad that the thing I don't like is a thing I can control.   2.  What are two things you love about your body?   I think I have beautiful feet. That golden hair that grows out of my forehead.   3.  What are three things you want to change about your home?   The address. The size. The lack of jacuzzi/hot tub.   4.  What are four books you want to read this year?   The Hours by Michael Cunningham Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer (guessing on spelling) The Brothers Karamazov Naked by David Sedaris   5.  What are five promises you have kept to yourself?   Listen to New Year's Day every New Year's Day.  Get out of debt (and then).  Live below my means.  Love my friends even if they are wrong and do things that hurt others (or me).  I have done wrong things, and I have hurt others, and though I never did it on purpose, I needed the love of friends to see me through.  Ooops...too heavy.  Devote myself to writing; but not to the exclusion of what matters.  Never give voice to  that , no matter how much I want to.
