Greetings from So-Cal.  Writing to you cordless!!  I’m here for some meetings and they’ve been fine.  Tonight the real entertainment began at our “celebration dinner” to celebrate a less than successful rollout, but it would be bad to not have the dinner that usually follows such rollouts, so whatever.  A certain celebrant decided that “celebration dinner” translates in idiot as ”you should be drunk”.  Examples include when we had ordered our own desserts and then he said “bring out another 3 or 4 tiramisus to share”.  Uh, there were only 9 of us, and we had all just ordered what we wanted.  Throughout dinner, when someone finished their drink, he would order another one for them.  They wouldn’t know it ‘till another (unwanted) new drink appeared in front of them.  My boss (a vegan) joined the table only to have him helpfully point her our to the waiter by yelling, “SHE’S THE VEGAN”.  I’m sure the other patrons appreciated this info.   After dinner, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot appeared, and he yelled “THIS IS ON ME, THIS IS A CELEBRATION FOR CRISSAKES!  I LIKE TO LIVE LIFE”.  Uh, okay… but the best was at the very end, when a few people had filtered out.  He cornered the two business sponsors and resident “corporate bigwigs” and told them “I DON’T UNDERSTAND OUR BUSINESS MODEL – IT IS GOING TO FAIL.  I KNOW THE BROKERAGE INDUSTRY LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND, AND WE’RE GOING TO FAIL.”  Mind you, we’re not in the brokerage industry…  Cue exit of everyone with the exception of Mr. My-resignation-is-forthcoming… we left him at the restaurant as he told us “I JUST SAW MY FRIEND – HE WANTS TO FINISH THE BOTTLE WITH ME”…  We re-convene tomorrow morning at 8am.  Hope he makes it.
