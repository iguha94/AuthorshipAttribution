The Morbidly Obese Doth Offend from Time to Time   DJS, Hal and I work with this woman named "Jan." "Jan" is morbidly obese and she is our "Reception Specialist" (nope, I did not make that up).  Anyway, Jan figures prominently in the story I am about to tell.   Last week, we hired a gentleman by the name of HB.  HB is an African American.  He is in his late forties, has a moustache, three grown children, one grandchild and moved to the Twin Citays in 1975 to start working in the title business (for the record I was 7 in '75).  He is shorter than me by 6 inches or so, balding and well dressed (unlike the loveable Duf).  He is soft spoken and wears a ring on his right hand.  He cannot type 75 wpm.  He lives in Minneapolis (I live in "The Paul" or "Shots Paul," by the way).  He is a title expert and I had to use spell check to get "title" right.  He can not rock the mike.  He cannot bust a move (see photo, above:  nuff said about Duf).  He is not a vegetarian, a unitarian or uber-liberal.  He went to a private university and not the best land grant University in the world.  He drives an American car and talks to his parents more than once a month.  He has had a colonoscopy.  He has never had a one night stand with buxom twins, nor has he won an award for BMX trick riding.   Anyway, I was walking down the hall with HB, and on my way back to my desk Jan says to me, she says:  "You two are a lot a like."  That, my friends is superficial thinking at its shallowest.  In reply I simply said:  "Whereas you, 'Jan,' are unique in the world."
