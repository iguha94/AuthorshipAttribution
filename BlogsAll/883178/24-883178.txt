Panda, I'm in total compliance with you on both counts.  I thought  Jackass: The Movie  was sheer genius.  I don't remember laughing so hard in my life...well, in the last couple of years anyway.  I personally thought the end thing (after the credits) with them as old men was the funniest thing I've ever seen.  I'm a big fan of exessiveness.  Anyway.  As for Kevin Smith latest foray: I haven't seen it and I highly doubt I ever will.  I struggled through  Dogma  which was such an over-rated piece of crap, I kind of felt cheated.  Was I offended by it because I'm religious?  No, and for the record, I'm about as agnostic as they get.  I just thought the performances were awful (Linda Fiorentino was horrible) and that snootchie-bootchie shit is for the birds.  After seeing 'Shitma' in the theatres, I swore off seeing any more Jay & Silent Bob movies.  They pantsed me on Mallrats and I felt taken again with Dogma.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me. The funniest thing is, ol' Kevie Smith peaked at Clerks and that was the flick he did with the smallest budget.  Oh...if anyone is wondering how  Gangs Of New York  is, I can sum it up in a couple of words: Waste Of Time.  Easily one of the worst (and most boring) movies I've seen in a long time.   Catch Me If You Can  was pretty good, though.
