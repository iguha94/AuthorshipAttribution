Hal has turned me into a freak!   Okay, I have a mildly obsessive complusive side, I admit that.  I even worry a little bit that it will get worse and worse as I get older and older until I am washing and washing my hands fifty times a day and re-alphabetizing and re-alphabetizing my CD over and over.    Anyway, Hal used to give me a hard time because I had a tendency to accumulate e-mails in my MS mail Inbox.  Sometimes I would have like 2200 items in my Inbox with 900 or so unread (let me explain here that I have preview so I can see the first few lines of e-mail messages without opening them.  So if I can glean the essence of the message without opening it, then I do/did).  Anyway, I finally swept my box clean, and now I am a freak about zeroing it out all the time.  It's unhealthy.  I live in fear that I will return to the dark days of multiple messages stacking up and stacking up and stacking up...until, finally, I am living in a house full of magazines and newspapers and spent fast food bags and junk mail and bulk food purchases from Sams Club so that finally I have to cut pathways just to get from room to room and the only thing in the house that is not dirty is the clean-ass sink where I wash my hands over and over and over until they are chapped and bleed justifying the medication I so clearly need (only to take it obsessively - twice a day, ten and ten, but after food, so I will have some bread before each one, but then I must toast it, but only slightly and no butter or margarine unless it's Friday).  Okay, gotta go arrange my sock drawer.
