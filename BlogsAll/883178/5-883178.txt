I haven't been able to post much lately. It seems that either a) the internet is down at work, b) I am being forced to proofread recipes, or c) I am repeating "you can't quit your job, or you will have to live on the street" over and over in my head, which means I haven't had much time for Pandyland.  But I did manage to take that brat packer quiz. I am sad to report I came up as Long Duck Dong. Embarassing.  Y'all can read my story if you want...it's a little strange to have people want to read something I wrote, because I don't write many stories -- I just write in my journal, which I'm sure you all would find WAY more interesting, but that's too bad, you can't read it. Posting it seems a little weird though. It's less than 900 words (per the contest's instructions) but still...kind of a long post. And it's on my home computer anyways. And the dog (or mouse) might eat it by the time I get home, you just can't ever tell...  I heard our crazy neighbors fighting last night. All I caught was "You're crazy! And angers me! Take it down this instant!" which I can only assume is referring to the notes she has posted on the door to keep the window washers away (it's been a month now).   Duf -- I have reviewed my copy of the burners code of ethics. Your cookies are on the way. BTW, I am v. sad to hear that the Jack Johnson show at First Ave sold out really fast, which means we can't go.   Panda -- I *love* cheesecake. I can't wait to go to your wedding.   DJS -- I want to do another quiz.   Hal -- I want to play Stratego later.  Billygoat -- I miss you.
