Everything old is new again...  Having attended pre-school through college in this town, you’d think I run into people I know all the time.  In some ways this is true, but not nearly as much as you’d expect.  The exception being that in the last two weeks I feel like I have run into everyone I’ve ever known ever.  I ran into the previously mentioned “Nick” (let’s all be thankful I’m not using Panda’s nickname for him) at Blockbuster a few weeks ago.  Of course, I heard him before I saw him.  Thankfully, I was able to duck out without him noticing me.  Now, before you judge me, I challenge any of you to engage with Nick by choice.  There.  So, a day or two after that near-miss I ran into a friend’s ex-bf at a bar.  What followed was a surprisingly uncomfortable conversation (who knew there were lingering feelings between him and myself?).  But I recovered.  Then on Saturday I got a call on my cell phone from a very gay man who claimed to be an ex-bf and wouldn’t identify himself.  This was really disturbing for a lot of reasons.  But then when he identified himself I was really happy – it was Sholl!  (before nasty rumors get started, let me clarify that he is not, in fact, an ex).  I had heard nothing of that cat for maybe 5 years and then he runs into a mutual friend’s husband, gets my number, and just like that we’re in touch again.  Finally, yesterday I get together with an old friend I’ve seen little of in the past few years and we played catch-up.  I don’t know if you can count him as a long-lost friend exactly, but I also saw the white-haired karaoke m.c. guy that hosts all karaoke in the western metro, this weekend.  I hadn’t seen him in long time, either.   Now I hear that Nick and Duda were spotted on the jumbo-tron.  Will wonders never cease?  Moral of the story?  I need to relocate.
