At its height, the internet, like a vibrant democracy, provides a forum for the free exchange of ideas.  As a community, we can work toward consensus and truth by debating issues of the day and elevating responses that are sound logically, ideologically, philosophically.   Within the internet community, a blog, and in particular a group blog like this is a distillation of that forum.  Together, us members of Pandyland can develop synergy and a higher collective understanding.  We are all like mountain climbers progressing toward a summit and infinitely more likely to reach it because we are not working alone, but, rather, in concert with like minded people.  We are a team focused on a single goal.  In order for us to reach that goal, we need to feel that we can talk about things freely and openly.  So, when Panda shares her story of love on the rocks, we are, as a community, elevated.  When HAL told her story of back pain, we were enriched.  DJS's deep sharing about his love of the Band the Eels was awe-inspiring.    And in that spirit, I would like to thank Stoner for bringing us all closer together, for stimlulating a marketplace where ideas can be exchanged, and for bringing us all closer to higher truths by sharing her story about her struggles to overcome plantars warts.  Which everyone knows come from sinful living and not swimming pools.  Are you right with God, Stoner?  You must be because the smite was lifted!    But I digress from praising Stoner for helping us on our climb:  can you see the summit friends?   Also, DJS, I would like to suggest the band name:  This Treatment (with mad props to Stoner).
