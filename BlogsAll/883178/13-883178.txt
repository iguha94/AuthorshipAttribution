Anyone who knows me pretty well knows that I love monkeys.  My brother gave me an "adopt-an-orangutan" kit for a present and now I am the proud mother of a funny looking monkey in Borneo named "Einstein."  I also love that Sprint PCS commercial highlighting the "monkey with a cold."  No, not a "movie that is old."  How cute is he with those Kleenexes?  Pretty darn cute.  Before the Snipers were caught, Billygoat and I commented on the $15 or so million they were asking for ransom money.  We thought the people of Maryland could have a fund raising activity...perhaps a "Bowling for Snipers" telethon. People could take pledges and then the Sniper would get one of those big, monstrous checks like they give away for Publisher's Clearing House.  But then we thought that might not be a good idea for the Sniper because then everyone would see him.  It's a thought anyway.  I picked up and listened to  Selmasongs  today after it had collected dust over the last year.  What a musical spectacular.  Bjork is one talented imp.  I remember how happy I was the first time I listened to this album, and in my excitement, I called up HAL to share my good fortune.  She very unenthusiastically informed me that a "certain coworker" of hers had the album too and played it all the damn time.  I guess she didn't like it as much as me and the "certain coworker" did.  Hmmmm.  I'm going solo to my cousin's wedding this weekend.  My brother and dad already promised a dance with me.  Great, that's all I need to feel better - to dance with a couple of 6' 6" buffoons.  There better be an all-night open bar.  Or the DJ better play U2-all-night-long.    Things have been pretty slow around these parts.  I go to NYC again next week, so hopefully things will pick up by then.  Cheers!
