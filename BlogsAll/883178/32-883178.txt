DJS, glad to hear you saw Frida!  HAL heard this story first-hand, but just to give y'all a quick recap:  I went out with the girls on Saturday night...the same time my parents were staying at my place because they went to see an opera on Saturday in Chicago.    I drank way too many margaritas, as well as some sort of red shot, lots of Newcastle, and zambooka.  Damn zambooka.  The night involved the above drinks, a sweet jukebox, an extremely friendly Irishman, a guy who looked like one of the singers in the Barenaked Ladies, and a computer programmer with a girlfriend (the one guy  I  decide to talk to all night, btw.  And, I don't remember his name.)  To make a long story short...I stumbled into my studio apartment at 1am, went into the bathroom, and puked.  And to remind you, my parents were sleeping over...so they heard and saw everything.  My mom played the sympathy ticket: "Oh honey, I feel so sorry for you..."  While my dad was a smart ass as usual: "Too much medicine, huh?  *laughs under breath*"  I mumbled something and got into bed...the next day, as death warmed over me, mom and dad got me up at 7am to go to mass.  Oh my Lord.  I've never felt more like ass...ever.  The one time I go out hard core in about  two years  and my parents spend the night.  Good grief.
