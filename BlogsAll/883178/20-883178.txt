Wow.  I don't log in for an afternoon and I miss all the good shiz-nit.  Let me tackle the important issues in brief.   1% Milk  - I'm with HAL all the way on this.  I refuse to drink that transparent skim milk sludge.  It's watery, gross and you don't get the good spits from drinking a pint of skim.  Ick...just think of it...  "No...we don't want real milk...let's just SKIM some off the top."   Caffeine  - Tomorrow will mark my one month anniversary of being caffeine free.  Crazy...but that's how it goes.  I'm really beginning to think that caffeine really didn't have that much sway over me.  I'm still able to stay up as late as I need to (1:30am last night) and now I don't get the jitters around 11:30am or so if I don't have a delicious Diet Coke.  Does I miss it?  Yes...but I've got a hard time accepting that something like a frigging Soft Drink had that much of a hold on me.   Kids Stuff  - As you may all be aware, I'm pretty much immune to the 'growing up' requirements.  This is the stuff I STILL do:   1.  Play Vids (or Video Games to the lamen)  2.  Get Happy Meals at McD's  3.  Read comic books  4.  Buy an occasional action figure  5.  Read children's books.  I highly recommend the Series of Unfortunate Events series  6.  Eat Orange Tic Tacs like candy, instead of using them as breath mints  7.  Fart on the phone when I'm talking to my brother  8.  Buy dumb things out of coin machines: super balls, stickers, crappy rings  9.  Think Star Wars is the best movie...ever.
