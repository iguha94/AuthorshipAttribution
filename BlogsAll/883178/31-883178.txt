From the 'Yeah...We Already Know' Department...    I just snapped up the CD from  The White Stripes  yesterday.  The verdict?  This DJ likey.  He likey a lot.  I had it in my hand at Target and as I perused the aisles of quality products at reasonable prices, I hemmed and hawwed about getting it.  I knew like 2 songs on the CD and since I was late to jump on the band wagon, it was priced to own at $14.99 (which I think is a bit steep).  On my way back toward the video games, I decided to put it back.  When I did, I set it on another shelf for a clerk to put reshelve later.  Little did I know, but I managed to put it near some other CD offerings...one of which was, you guessed it:  The White Stripes.  Only this one was different.  For a mere $13.99 (that's $1 in savings) not only did you get the CD, but you also got a DVD with 4 (count 'em 4) videos and 2 unreleased songs on it.  Sold.  I can't stress how cool these cats are.  Loud, sloppy rock with the just the right amount of lyrical wit and genius.  If you love Justin Timberlake and glossily produced stuff, you'll HATE this.  It's a contender for best CD of the year in my book... which gives me an idea!
