Well I'll be dashed...    Somehow, I stumbled onto a website where they had the ability to extract my e-mail address.  Yes, friends...my WORK e-mail address.  One day I'm minding my own business, the next, I'm INUNDATED with all kinds of garbage e-mails.   'DJS!  Here is the viagra information you requested!'  'Hey, DJS...here's how to increase your breast size!'  'We know you'll love this spycam, DJS...and no shipping!'  'Want to adopt a burn victim, DJS?'     I know this isn't exactly a news-breaking event, but I've reached the boiling point.  I click on the things on the bottom of these awful e-mails telling these assholes that I don't want to get their newsletters anymore, but I'm beginning to think that might just INCREASE the amount of garbage I get in my e-mail box.  Since I'm quite the hot head at times, I've decided to strike back.  I'm sending each of them a nice little reply.  I'm also thinking of opening another site so that I can chronicle my battles with these dirty, filthy, leech-like spam-mails I get.
