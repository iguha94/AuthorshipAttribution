Duf,  As you requested, I have written my one letter.  I wrote this to Kellogg's, praising their Special K Red Berries cereal.   Dear Sir/Madam:  You don’t know how happy it makes me to see those freeze-dried strawberries every time I pour myself a bowl of Kellogg’s Special K Red Berries.  I have always been a big fan of the “traditional” Special K – growing up, my grandma ate a bowl everyday while preaching your mantra to anyone who would listen: “if you can pinch an inch…”  So with the addition of the “Red Berries,” not only am I keeping grandma’s legacy alive, but I’m also enjoying the sweetness the new Berries have to offer.  However, I do have 2 questions:  1) Why did you name the strawberries “Red Berries”?  Is there a trademark on the word “Strawberry”?  Do people ever complain because they were expecting RASPBERRIES in their cereal? (because those are red too) 2) Have you ever thought about selling the freeze-dried strawberries SEPARATE from the cereal?  I have to say, sometimes I just empty a box and dig around for the crunchy sweet goodness of the “Red Berries”.  They remind me of when I tried space food when I went to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago as a kid…weird texture, but oddly delicious.  You could dominate an entirely new food category with this idea: Cereal Accompaniments.  If you sell them separately in their own bags, consumers could buy them to put on any kind of cereal they wish, not just Special K.  Please tell me if this is something you have already considered.  And again, thank you for a great breakfast experience.  Keep the Berries coming.   I will keep you posted on any reply I receive. I am already expecting a form letter, so maybe I'll be delightfully surprised.
