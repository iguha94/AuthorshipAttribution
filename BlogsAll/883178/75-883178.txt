DJS: The Thursday Three    What is your first childhood memory?  My first childhood memory (no doubt aided by the super 8 films my parents took at the time) was me peering in at my baby brother Dr. Rob PHD in his crib.  I was just a little over two and I was extremely fascinated by the little bastard.  I would just watch him sleep in his crib and poke him from time to time if I wanted to see him do something.  I didn't go through the 'I'm jealous of the baby' phase.  No sir.  I just wanted him to grow up so that we could play with cars and Legos and such.   Do you have a favorite piece of clothing?  Discuss.  Yes I do.  I've got this old gray fleece sweatshirt that I wear all of the time.  It's a J. Crew (don't hate, it was my first) and I don't think I'll ever find a more functional piece of clothing ever.  It's great for when it's cold and I just need something to throw on real quick in the winters.  Spring and fall I use it for my famous cargo shorts/sweatshirt ensembles, but in summer I gotta put it away.  It's like a ritual.  Me to sweatshirt:  I'll see you in two months, friend.    Any weird morning rituals? (non-sexual in nature please...)  I don't know if this is considered a ritual, or even sexual, but I do it anyway.  Since DJ LZ gets up a good 45 minutes before me, she showers first.  Even though I'm dead tired and not ready to wake up, I try to sneak a peek at her from under the covers while she's getting dressed.  I do this every morning.  A little nudity in the morning is just the thing to make me feel refreshed and ready to face the day.  My ritual, of course, is ruined if she decides to get dressed in our walk-in closet while she's picking out what to wear.  What can I say?  I don't tire of seeing her in the buff.    Note: That's a good thing.
