I Leave Town for One Minute!; 2 best: Turkey Hunting is Not What I Thought    Let me get this straight -   Hal and Panda are going to Phoenix in Feb. Stoner is leaving banking for masonry. DJS is locking in. Panda got laid. Skip Gangs of New York.   Let me get this not so straight -  Hal ran into a gay (pronounced gey) ex who is not an ex. My old college roommate and his wife are having a baby (oops, wrong section) Skip Gangs of New York.   Back to getting things straight-  Here's my update (boring in comparison):  I survived hurricane Lequetta (Mother of Duffer) being in town (but just barely, friends, just barely). We went to see 42nd street at the Ordway, and it was pretty good (lots of tap dancing though).    Tomorrow (when I am in the office for a couple of hours - to slap Hal and call her names (it's jealousy, but I hide it well) - to shake DJS's hand and call him friend and beg to be an usher - to clean out my e-mail where I'm told I'm the biggest drain on our e-mail memory - God Techies lie!) I will share my two favorite sentences from holiday letters received Chez Duffer.  It's priceless - let's just say my old high school debate partner was cuckholded (can women be cuckholded, or is they just cheated on?), and I think two friends (married) got it  all the way on  while turkey hunting.  I miss you all so.  Truly I do.
