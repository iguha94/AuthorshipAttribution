Because I took a sick day on Friday I almost forgot...   THE FRIDAY/MONDAY/TUESDAY FIVE, by Panda.    1. What was the last song you heard?   God Put a Smile Upon Your Face  by Coldplay I'm really excited to see this band again this summer...I've been listening to this album a lot...not as much as Hal, though.   2. What were the last two movies you saw?   The Safety of Objects : Excellent.  Cool twist at the end. Tremendous cast - including the hottie drug dealer guy from the movie  Go .  Plus Joshua Jackson (Dawson's Creek cutie) plays a paralyzed guy.  That's weird.  All the Real Girls : Sweet movie, sad ending...you'll cry your eyes out if you have ever been in love.  Hell, you'll cry your eyes out anyway.  Paul Schneider is the next big thing.  You heard it here first.   3. What were the last three things you purchased?  Oatmeal w/banana at "Sushi Deli Flowers" this morning here in NY.  Salad and a pack of gum at "Terry's" for lunch.  I guess that's 3 things, albeit boring.  I plan on going shopping after work today (I can't pass Sephora in Times Square without twitching) so there will be more things added to this list later.     4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?  Drink, shop, laugh, and...drink.   5. Who are the last five people you talked to?  Suketu (sits next to me) My lady boss (she's a high-maintenance Jewess - I swear, she is always eating) My man boss (he's a wimpy little fella - wrote a haiku about him once) Myself (I think people are looking at me funny...) The Fella (he makes me smile and likes to cook stuff for me - next meal: Vegetable Biryani, an Indian delight!)
