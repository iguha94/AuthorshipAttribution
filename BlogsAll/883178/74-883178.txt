Bitch Session   Normally, when I'm finally back home in Chicago, I'm in a great mood.  Not today.  In addition to DJS overriding my post (no hard feelings, friend...I just thought I'd tease you), I've had my head slammed into the ground a few times today. (not literally)   1)  Another ass-backwards view from my company: it's more effective and cost-efficient for me to travel to NY and spend thousands of dollars a month to get trained, than for someone within our NY office to learn how to use our web teaching tool. This takes approximately 5 minutes to learn...I know because I've used it before with our clients.  I just don't get it.  Here's the direct quote I got from the head of L&D:  "I just spoke with the trainer and she has no experience with Webex. Since the trainer is inexperienced and the room is not set up, we won't be able to accommodate Panda virtually. Please let me know if you have any questions. We're sorry it didn't work out."  Yeah, I have a question.  Why is your intellectual equivalent a box of rocks?   2)  I don't understand why boys need to keep explaining themselves and asking "why?" when you've already told them "I'll call you if I change my mind."  One word: pathetic.  At least I have a date tonight...and we're going to my favorite place on earth - Medieval Times.  Horses, jousting, and bad food should get me out of this funk.  If not, then I guess we'll  have to resort to a Cuban restaurant.
