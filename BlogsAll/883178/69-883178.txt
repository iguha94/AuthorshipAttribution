Disclaimer/Friday Five, yos:   Disclaimer:  Per my bro (and he know, yo, he know) we are not a blog.  He is going to tell me what we are, but we are not a blog.  Answer like we are tho.   1. Explain why you started to journal/blog.  Reason one:  Like a good enema, journaling and blogging is good for purging the system.  Ahhhhh...I feel better already.  Reason two:  blogging helps me feel connected to Stoner.  Reason three:  I'm not in the business of defying Anne.  You feelin' me?   2. Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?  My bro know, wifey know, no one else know tho. I dunno.  I need to tell more people I guess.     3. Do you have a theme for your journal/blog?  It's a tie:  Getting paid and dancing the jig (like the sucka was on fire).   4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year?  Oh, we plan to blow up the spot, yo.  We are going to add photos and it's gonna be hard core.  Also, to keep it real because, for us, keepin' it real is like breathing.   5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.  I don't have a bunch, but my favorites are (in no particular order):  chokersandwich.com cruftbox.com mrsdiggs.com thismodernworld.com discount haiku.com  Note to my favorite blogs:  git yo ass back on the kerb and get my monies beeatches!
