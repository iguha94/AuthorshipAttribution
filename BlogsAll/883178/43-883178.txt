Tuesday Five: A little slow on the pick-up     1.  What is the one thing you don't like about your body?  The paleness of my skin…in winter I’m almost transparent.   2.  What are two things you love about your body?  That I can put my body through hell and back and it keeps on tickin’. My gorgeous toes.   3.  What are three things you want to change about your home?  I wish I had more room. I need more space. Did I mention I live in the smallest studio apartment on Lakeshore Dr??   4.  What are four books you want to read this year?  I don’t remember the last time I picked up the Bible.  Fast Food Nation  by Eric Schlosser To keep reading  Who Moved My Cheese  by Spencer Johnson when I start to feel out of control.  Why There Are No Good Men Left: The Romantic Plight of the New Single Woman  by Barbara Whitehead (Just kidding…)   5.  What are five promises you have kept to yourself?  Pay off my graduate student loan before I get married.  Thank God the wedding didn’t happen in November, because I just made the last payment last week. To remember my friends’ (and mother’s) birthdays. To stand by my convictions, no matter how unpopular: i.e., I’m probably the youngest (and only) Republican I know in Chicago.  To surround myself with music… and to keep playing the guitar since I can’t fit a piano in my tiny house. To eat whatever I like and not feel guilty about it.
