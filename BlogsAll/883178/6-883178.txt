Okay Panda, let me clear the air about the whole TV thing.  I've got the unfortunate 'sit-chee-ay-shun' where our living room is right smack dab next to the bedroom.  When the girlfriend is watching TV: (Alias, reruns of 90210, American Idol, parts of Fastlane and tons of other uh, stuff) I have no choice but to see some of it. After realizing that it's just as bad as everything else, I retire to the study and read. Yeah, it's sad.  It's not that I think I'm above quality shows shown to you piecemeal with rotten commercial interruptions every five minutes or so...heck no.  I like some TV, I just hate MOST of it.  That's all.  For the record, I can't watch more than an hour of network television without complaining and feeling my brain start to melt.  I DO however, have a deep, deep love of some of the HBO shows.  I'm talking your Sopranos (best show, ever!), Dennis Miller Live, and I'll admit it...I like Sex & The City.  Can you say Kristin Davis?  Yep...I can.  But, for your consideration, here are some shows I'll watch without wanting to commit a homicide:   1.  The Sorpanos  2.  Insomniac (Comedy Central)  3.  Real TV  4.  The Simpsons  5.  The Daily Show (rarely, these days)  6.  The Osbournes  7.  Sex & The City  8.  The Dennis Miller Fun Hour  9.  Crank Yankers  (Jesus...I couldn't even come up with 10!)   A note:  The only show I actually seek out and set aside time to watch is The Sopranos, everything else is stuff that while I'm surfing, I might stop on and watch a bit, but I don't set my clock, arrange my meals, or storm out of public places in a blind fury to watch.  Wow...I need to lighten up, eh???
