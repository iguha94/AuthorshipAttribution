HAL, someday I would like to hear the story about the blood all over your fridge.  That sounds bizarre...you could have made up some great story for one of the gem-sical blind dates you had recently.  "Yes, so now I would like you to see my  bloody  refrigerator..."  You know me, I always like a good tall-tale.  So Duf, your cynicism towards whether the current fella will be around 'til June would definitely be warranted under usual circumstances...I've been known to be somewhat fickle.  Hey, as they say, you gotta kiss a lot of frogs before you find your handsome prince.  But my cold-hearted snake exterior has been breaking down with this one...and it finally collapsed on Saturday when I was asked the question (this is the second time this has been asked, mind you): "Can I call you my girlfriend?"  (Dorky, I know, but that's a huge reason I like the big galoot.)  "Yes, I guess that would be alright."  When I told HAL this story, she told me she felt tears welling up.  Softy.  And if that's not enough, I'm making the  real  big leap: he's going to Wisconsin with me this weekend to meet the 'rents.  Stoner and HAL know that Proud Mary can be just about as blunt as me, so this should be interesting.  If he survives, I just might have to keep him around until the Coldplay show.  Maybe.    Since the tickets were sent to me and are in my possession, I am in the power seat.  As it should be.
