Thursday3 (in the place to be...ya heard me?); 3 Totally Unrelated Questions:    If you could be in any branch of the military, which would you choose and why?  I would either choose the Navy or the Air Force.  Probably the Air Force and here's why (I'm totally serious BTW).  I   HATE   mud.  I can't stand it.  If I was knee deep in the shit, like in 'Nam or something, I would need for it to be dry dirt.  I can't walk around in mud.  It makes me have to pee.  In Saigon, I would be a killing machine.  In the jungle, surrounded by mud, I would be worthless ("hold on a second guys, I have to pee pee").  Once, up in the boundary waters, I was portaging with a canoe on my back, and sank past my knee in slippery, slippery mud.  I was so unhappy.  So very, very unhappy.     What are your comfort foods/guilty pleasures?  French fries and donuts are my weaknesses.  Oh how I wish it were not so.     The thong movement has passed along an overall benefit to American fashion and the appearance of the American fanny.  Discuss.  I disagree.  I'm totally against it when it is not discrete.  The problem with the thong movement is that folks seem to have this need to flaunt the thong.  Folks that wear a thong with low cut jeans and a bare midriff so you can see the thong?  They are  so  wrong.  That should be illegal.  If people wear a thong and it's not known that they are wearing a thong, I think that's wonderful.    Also, being a non-thong guy, I wonder also if they aren't uncomfortable.
