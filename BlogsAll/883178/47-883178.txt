I Get Knocked Down, but I Get Up Again/You Light Up My Senses/Judge Him By the Content of His Riffs/Echoes   "Hell yeah."  Speaking of British music, I heard Chumbawamba singing on MPR this weekend (yep that makes me a double nerd); they sang this tune called "Jacob's Ladder: Not in My Name."  It was VERY political and after my goof yesterday, I will leave it there, but I'm all about Chumbawamba now (do I hear triple nerd concentrate?).  I saw at CD now dot com that they have a double disc with Noam Chomsky!  I might have to scoop that up.  And I don't care if you all tease me either, because I know there is at least one John Denver fan on this site!  By the way, I also like Woody and Arlo Guthrie.  There, it's out.    It hurts me that you all dog out Adam like you do.  I want to change my vote to Claytonland.  Isn't the bass track on the  Under-A-Blood-Red-Sky  version of "Gloria" enough for redemption?  Must he also be handsome?  I'm so sick of gender oppression I could scream!  All echoes and mad love for "25th Hour".  I am a Spike Lee fan, and I thought he was near the height of his game here.  I too, thought Barry and Ed did a great job, but my kudos go to the always phenomenal Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  Also, Anna Paquin did a fine job.  I recommend the movie without reservation.    "Enron mu*&^%$%ers!"
