On a Side Note: Don't Forget Stedman   Stedman Graham has been Oprah's "steady" for years now.  He's a community leader but will never get the kind of credit Oprah gets because he's not on TV (although you'd think sleeping with her would give him  a bit more  press...).  And he's generally a pretty nice guy.  I saw him once on one of my flights to NY.  I recognized him (since I live in Chicago, I probably see him more in the news than others might).  No one else even noticed the poor sap.  He was sitting in COACH -  behind  little old me!  Finally, one of the stewardesses realized who he was and quickly led him up to First Class.  Now, I usually think the people in First Class are major snobs (I've only been there twice - I hoard my upgrades), but you'd think a guy who has his hands on Oprah's loot would have said something.  But he didn't...and he looked  really  embarrassed to be "escorted" up there.    I think any guy that can stand in the type of shadows a woman like Oprah casts deserves mucho credit and accolades.  The only "friend of a friend" stories I have about Oprah are: 1) My coworker Thong works out at the same health club Oprah belongs to.  She says she sees her there from time to time and without her make-up she looks AWFUL.  Thong claims she never went up to her for an autograph, but I was once out with Thong in NY when we ran into Queen Latifah at a steak joint.  Not only did she go up to the Queen herself (while buzzed, no less), but she also said “what’s happenin’ sistah?”  I thought I’d die of embarrassment.  So maybe I can’t trust Thong. 2) A former coworker of mine once saw her walking her dogs off of Michigan Ave...again, no make-up.  Absolutely hideous.
