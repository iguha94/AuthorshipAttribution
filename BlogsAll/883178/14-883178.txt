Hey guys,  DJS - Nice work with the links and photo page!  Me likey.  Any chance we'll get a link to soft drink? ;)  Me also likey not working.  This morning mom and I went for facials, then to Cafe Latte for lunch.  While Cafe Latte is normally a great lunch spot it was more crowded then I'd ever seen it (due to MEA weekend??) and I felt rushed through the line by the pair behind us.  It used up all the relaxation I had banked up the hour before.  The crazy woman behind us kept telling her friend that she got her teeth "from the bone bank - doesn't that sound weird?".  For the record lady, yes it does.  She repeated it several times to her buddy, though I'm sure the she heard it each time, just like all the rest of us did.  Then she said "some people died from knee parts that they got from the bone bank, I hope that doesn't happen to me!!"  Well, I disagree.  I hope she dies.  While in St. Paul I swung by the UST bookstore (long story).  It was really weird to be in such a familar place with not a single familar face  - except for a glimpse of Fr. Lavin shuffling through Murray-Herrick (speaking of people about to die...).  Anyway, not much has changed, though the Grill got all new chairs and tables and it looks pretty nice.  No update on "Scooters", though.  Sorry, Panda.
