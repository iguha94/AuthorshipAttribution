Ummm…P. Diddy? Busta? I don’t know who sings that. Give me more lines.   I just interviewed the biggest “character” at my company. He absolutely, positively, completely and totally loves direct mail with all of his heart. And if you ask him how he is, he’ll say something along the lines of “I am so incredibly wonderful right now, it’s almost impossible to be any better.”   When I first interviewed him last year, he tried to get me to change my auto insurance. Today he filled me in on the entire history of sales, marketing, and direct mail. (It was actually quite interesting.) He is definitely the king of “leave silence and someone will fill it” which left me cracking some pretty confused one-liners in hopes of getting the subject back on track.   I knew I was in for it when I walked into his office and sat down – the first words out of his mouth were “so when are you getting married?” to which I replied “um…someday? I hope? I am currently un-engaged, with no plans to get engaged in the near future…” He just looked at me with a straight face. I couldn’t figure out if he was going to set me up with a grandson or something. (He’s old enough to be retired, but loves direct mail too much to quit.)   I think he tries to shake things up at the start of every conversation, and that’s why he has so much fun. Either that or he’s crazy…like a fox.   Finally, Panda I hope that meow was coming from you and not from me (Coco) because I don’t like cats.
