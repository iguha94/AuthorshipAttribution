Clean to Very Clean  By Gunnery Sargeant First Class Duf Fer  We probably should not go public with this (for national security reasons), but since we have a very small readership and code names and all, we should be fine.    Okay, here goes.  DJS and I are special ops operatives for a national agency (unnamed for national security reasons).  If you notice that our number of posts goes down, it's because we are in the "shit" over in the Middle East killing "the madman of Baghdad" or taking out select members of Iraq's Republican Guard.    For example, earlier today, we got word that Saddam (correct pronounciation rhymes with "Madam" or "Adam") was at the Best Buy in Bloomington.  When we got there, it turns out it he was at the Bruegger's Bagel Bakery.  So we went there, and they said he was at the Borders Bookstore.  We found him in the magazine section trying to hide behind a copy of "Juggs" that he stuffed inside the "Harvard Business Review" so that we would not know he was a smutter.  Anyway, it turns out this perv was just some Saddam look-a-like.  But, to be safe, we exterminated the target with extreme prejudice using our typical surgical precision:  it was a clean to very clean hit.  Most shoppers were unaware that there was an assassination during their noon hour.    Just doing our part...
