Stoner - that's so spontaneous - I LOVE IT!  The only reason I would want to go on a cruise is because I could have access to a buffet 24-7.  Not that I would actually  eat  24-7, but just knowing the food is there would bring me great happiness.  Jan scares me.   My lack of filters came out again today.  Thong was showing us a picture of this girl in TCW magazine (TCW stands for "Today's Chicago Woman" - one of those free publications that shows you pictures of the so-called "swanky" crowd at their snob parties hanging out with so-called "celebrities" that happen to be in town...it's right up Thong's alley...the life she yearns for.)  Well, she told us that one of her friends told her she looked "just like" one of the girls on the "51 Singles You Should Know" list.  This is just about the gayest "article" ever - they ask these chachi's what their "Turn-ons" are or, please, tell us about your "Sense of Style".  Barf.  There were actually 2 pictures of the girl Thong supposedly looked like.  In one of them she looked fairly normal, but a little bloated, and the other one was kind of a glamour-shot type pose.  Thong made the mistake of asking me which one she looked more like.  My response (pointing at the glamour-shot pose): "You definitely look more like her.  She wears too much make-up."  Um, did I just say that?
