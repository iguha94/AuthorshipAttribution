Monday Five - DJS Version 1.0     1. What is one thing you don't like about your body?    1.  I'm getting gray much too soon.  I'm only 30 for crissakes!    2. What are two things you love about your body?    1.  I like my nose.  It's just the right size and isn't too pointy or weird looking.  Plus, the nostrils are just the right size for my fingers in case I have to do some quick excavating.    2.  My ears aren't bad either.  The cartiledge has stayed pretty solid and I don't have big Dumbo ears or anything.    3. What are three things you want to change about your home?    I'd like to (when we get a bigger place):   1.  Build a darkroom for photography and such.   2.  Design the ultimate office for writing and research.  When I get the book deal, I'd love to have that ready and waiting.    3.  I want to add a kid or two (or three) to the home.    4. What are four books you want to read this year?      1.  Return of the King    2.  Black House    3.   Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix    4.  Edgar Allen Poes Complete Tales    5.  The Thief Lord    5. What are five promises you have kept to yourself?     1.  Never sacrifice happiness for anything.   2.  To continue writing until I die.    3.  To never smoke filthy cigarettes or take any sort of illegal drugs.  (go ahead, call me square)    4.  To visit ancient places sometime.    5.   To never forget those who are important to me.
