Special thanks to Stoner for performing a vigilante rodent inspection earlier this week (she gave us the all-clear).  My own rodent-removal procedure consisted of hysterical calls to our apartment management company (creatively called “Apartment Management Company”).  The woman with the lucky job of answering the phones there calmly explained to me that the mouse will eat the poison put out by the exterminator “and then leave your apartment to die”.  I wasn’t quite sold with that premise as I’d think a mouse would choose to die in the plush environs of our apartment versus venturing out into the world for one last adventure, but since we have several senior citizens in our building, this lady gets must get away with such tall tales on a regular basis.  Whatever.  To further complicate all this, I’ve seen too many Tom & Jerry, Speedy Gonzales, and even Micky Mouse cartoons to begin to think that it’s a done deal that the mouse will eat the poison, no matter how enticing.  I’m nervous that left to its own devices, the little bastard will sneak the poison in my morning coffee and hit me over the head with a giant anvil.   So now that we’ve confirmed that the only residents of apartment 205 are Stoner and myself, I can look forward to a pleasant weekend.  *sigh*  Further housing lowdown… I caught a bit of   “Rear Window”  recently, and it has me even more suspicious of the clowns across the hall.  I’m determined to figure out what’s up – so far my sleuthing has uncovered the fact that they keep their mini-blinds nearly closed a lot of the time.  I’ll keep you updated.
