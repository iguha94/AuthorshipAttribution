Tellin it like it is: The Friday Five    1. Explain why you started to journal/blog.  1) I get incredibly bored at work. 2) It's a good idea to keep in touch with the Twin Cities crew.  It's the only way HAL will continue to send me presents.  3) To meet new and interesting people: Duf & DJS - who woulda thunk I could love ya so darn much?!?     2. Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?  Most of the people I tell about it look at me funny or forget the address, so they never read it anyway.  My parents definitely don't know...mom would be sorely disappointed in her angelic daughter.  I would never again tell anyone I'm dating about it...how could I give y'all the dish otherwise?   3. Do you have a theme for your journal/blog?  1) Bono 24-7-365; 2) Time to get our drink on.   4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year??  I definitely think we should continue to add embarrassing photos of our members...I'll be sure to bring my camera to Minneapolis in March.   5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.?  I only have 3: I found   this one  randomly, but it has some interesting perspectives.  Hate Wal-Mart? (Or your job/coworkers in general?) Then you'll love   this . Not as much a blog, as a diary of   adventures in bowling .
