For the record, our apartment is spotless (except for the peanut butter that is probably now all over the place, thanks to our old-fashioned mousetraps).   We think the vermin has something to do with the people across the hall. They're very suspicious -- about two weeks ago, window washers were going into each apartment to wash the windows. There were signs posted everywhere telling us that our apartments would be entered, and our windows would be washed. This prompted the neighbor lady to hang a number of things on her door, including: 1) a doorknob hanger that says "do not disturb", 2) a copy of the fax she sent to the apartment management company, requesting that she not be disturbed because she is working on a very important civil court case and just does not have time for this 3) a copy of the letter she sent -- via certified mail -- telling the window washer place that her apartment is not to be disturbed, 4) notes for the "independent contractor window washers" in case they somehow missed the message that this apartment is not to be disturbed. This stuff is still hanging on their door, even though the window washers have been done with our floor for almost two weeks now. I've been a little too scared to read everything that is posted, because I don't want them to jump out, grab me, and pull me into their scary apartment. Hal thinks it is a human chop shop.   ANYWAYS, that's why we think there is a mouse around...because of the dead bodies.
