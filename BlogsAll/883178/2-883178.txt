Today I am visiting my nemesis:  REI  REI and I don’t mix.  I made a few trips there earlier this summer to prepare for my Fourth o’ July Colorado shoot out, er, camping trip and had some bad experiences.  There is a lot of attitude amongst those climbing wall-ers.  Suffice it to say, I am not a member.  So why go back?  I do it out of love for my big bro.  This Friday night he flies in from NYC and the next AM he’s heading straight for the boundary waters.  For this purpose, he needs a paddle.  Lest you figure him to be a poor planner, let me explain.  He has ordered a paddle online from said merchant, but in his words “it’s not here yet, and I’m worried it will be too short”.  Okayyyyy…  To remedy this, he would like me to pick up an alternate paddle at (hated) REI so that he has options when he arrives in Minneapolis.  I will then be returning the rejected paddle to (hated) REI.  It’s a simple task, I guess, and I’m willing to brave those over-gortexed fools, but brother has another request – pick out not one, but three “really nice looking paddles of a specific type, so I can choose among them”.  He explained that he’s really particular about the wood grain.  Uh-huh.    The saddest thing is, as I retold this tale to Stoner, she pointed out that I’m the same way about shoes (and I’m pretty sure that that if I bring home another purse, I’m breaking the lease, or something).  I had little argument.  Except, that I haven’t asked anyone to bring the shoe department to me.  Then again, I haven’t spent much time in New York (apparently).  On a much happier note, who’s going to win American Idol?  I was a late arrival to the show, but it has me hooked.
