MS Mail...oh God, don't get me started.  I'm pissed that I missed the hastily-arranged Country Bar Meltdown on Saturday.  I was sick as a dog on Friday.  Literally, I was sitting at my desk and felt like I was stoned (not that I have any idea what that's like) with my mouth hanging open and staring at the computer like I was some kind of a-hole.  It got so bad, that I told CK2 that I needed to go off and up out of the place and kill time until DJ LZ (my girlfriend) was ready to head back to the burbs.  So...what'd I do?  "There's a place for fun in your life..."  Mall of America, yo.  I went in, walking like a zombie and purchased a doughnut ala Krispy Kriz-eme and enjoyed a mouth-watering bottle of milk.  From there, I promptly headed to the video game store and played a demo version of Star Wars: The Clone Wars on Gamecube.  I got to fly a ship and kick some ass, but when my guy popped out of the ship and flipped on his lightsaber, the game took a turn for the worst.  It was some bad actor trying to do Mace Windu (Sam Jackson's character) and it stunk.  That, and a bunch of guys hit me with the killing.  Good time-waster, shitty game.  So, in a nutshell, I was too sick later that night for karaoke and such.  But I'm there next time.  P.S. Don't believe the Cocks.  8 Mile was a good flick.
