Being Proactive with the Friday 5, yo.    1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?  Does Smurfette count as a superhero?  Because she rocks.  She lives in this village of  all men  and just flirts to get her way.  She’s the ultimate woman/blue creature.   2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?  Off hand, I can’t think of anything I wanted for myself.  (On the same wavelength as Duf…) My brother wanted a go-kart since the moment he could talk.  So sometimes I would ask my parents for a go-kart for Christmas/Birthdays since I thought I’d have more “seniority” or something because I was older.  That never worked.  We never got a go-kart.  When my cousin did we were green with envy…and that bitch never let us drive it.  That still makes me mad.   3. What's the furthest from home you've been?  Bangkok & Chaing Mai/Rai in Thailand – the most gorgeous place on earth.   4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?  I’ve always wanted to learn an Asian language, but I don’t know if I’d have the patience for it.  And I still need to learn to drive stick.   5. What are your plans for the weekend?   What’s with this question every week?  I’m going to see a punk show tonight at the Elbo Room, looking at a condo (possible purchase??) on Saturday, Comedy Sportz tomorrow night, movie on Sunday.  O-u-t...out!
