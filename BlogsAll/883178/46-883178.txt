So I picked up a copy of Jack Kerouac's  On the Road  at the airport.  And I paid more for it than a book of this sort should cost.  I always think that  On the Road  should be like tarot cards.  The kind of thing you are not supposed to buy but are supposed to just happen upon.    I know this book is one that you either love or hate, and, if memory serves, DJS is in the hate camp. But, to me, I can tell you that, 1/3 of the way into the book, it will definitely be a favorite of mine.    As I have been reading it, on planes and in airports, people have come up to me and commented.  It's a community building book.  Here is an excerpt that stuck with me.  There are others that stuck with me more, but it would take a long time to type them, and after my lengthy post earlier this week...  "He was simply a youth tremendously excited with life, and though he was a con man, he was only conning because he wanted so much to live and to get involved with people who would otherwise pay no attention to him.  He was conning me and I knew it (for room and board and "how to write", etc.) and he knew I knew (this has been the basis of our relationship), but I didn't care and we got along fine - no pestering, no catering; we tiptoed around each other like heartbreaking new friends."  To me, the book is a love letter to America, and it is poetry.  I may end up liking it like Panda likes  The Foutainhead .
