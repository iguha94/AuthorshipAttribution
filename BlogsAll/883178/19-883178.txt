Unfortunately, DJS, I think  we're  our only fans.  :(  So I'm off to London/Brussels tomorrow evening and  can't wait .  I can't wait to eat  real  fish and chips, watch the Big Breakfast, go to some good Indian Restaurants, attend an evensong at Westminster Abbey, eat Belgian chocolate, and talk to many British men.  What I will not do: buy Belgian lace.  For some screwed  up reason my mom is sad that I'm not more into the lace-thing.  It's not like I plan on ever decorating with doilies, so I don't know what the problem is.  I met a friend for drinks a couple days ago when I was in NY.  We had traveled through Thailand together (not really by choice, he happened to be in my MBA class) and so I think he’s under the impression that we have this eternal “bond.”  Since I’m usually bored out of my mind when I’m in NYC for business, I hastily accepted his invitation.  Not much has changed with him since I last saw him a year ago – he’s still a chachi frat boy who can’t let go of the frat boy days when beer bongs were cool.  So the intellectual stimulation was minimal, but the scotch consumption was definitely to the maximum (which I bought on DDS’ tab, by the way).  Me?  I just had a glass of free champagne that came with my room.  So after getting the $70 bar tab and walking out of the place, he actually said to me…”You know, if I didn’t have a girlfriend right now, we could get it  on .”  My reaction: “You gotta be kidding me.”  Guys are complete morons.  Sometimes it sucks to be single again.
