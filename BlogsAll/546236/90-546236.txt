Since the 9/11 Commission will report that there are   fairly sizeable ties betwerrn Iran and AQ , including information given to some of the 9/11 hijakcers (though not about the attacks themselves), this places the Democrats in a curious position.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Both Kerry and Edwards have described the war in Iraq as "needless."&nbsp; Presumably they will try to use the 9/11 report to bolster their claims that the US went to war with the wrong country.&nbsp; However, by claiming that Iraq was the "wrong" country--that necessitates that one believes there was a "right" country for the US&nbsp;to go to war with (assuming you're not a pacifist).&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's not bloody likely that Kedwards will become terribly hawkish when it comes to Iran. &nbsp; That being said, I don't believe that Kedwards can make much political hay out of the 9/11 report on this point since any attempts to sound hawkish towards Iran will either (1) ring hollow in comparison to their earlier statements, (2) directly contradict those earlier claims or (3) alienate the hard left segment of their base by appearing more hawkish. &nbsp; So what CAN the Dems do with this?&nbsp; Well, they can try to distance themselves from the "with us/against us" policy of the Bush doctrine and then call for more "diplomatic" pressures on Iran.&nbsp; But that runs the risk of making the Dems appear REAL soft on the matter--after all, you can argue that Iraq's ties weren't strong enough--but where Iran's ties are even stronger, "containment" in a post 9/11 world doesn't really fly. &nbsp; So my ultimate conclusion, backed up by nothing in particular, is that this revelation by the 9/11 commission will not help the Dems all that much. &nbsp;
