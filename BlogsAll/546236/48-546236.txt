Been mulling this over for a bit (read: a day) and have come to the following conclusion:  I don't believe that John Kerry has any intention of "staying the course" in Iraq should he become president. I think his public statements are (shockingly) calculated to give him a defensible argument that his ultimate decision to pull out of Iraq is justified. Here's how I see Kerry's views:   (1) The war is not a legitimate exercise. (1a) The war was entered into under false pretenses & Bush lied/misled/etc us into war (2) The war in Iraq has NOT made us safer  (3) The war is NOT sufficiently (if at all) connected to the War on Terrorism.  From this, it's very easy to make a logically consistent argument justifying pulling out of Iraq.  After all, how could the pursuit of an illegitimate, costly, ill-conceived, and wrongheaded war EVER be in our national interest?  From this comes the position that it's NOT "cutting and running" to pull out of Iraq--but rather the ending of a fool's errand that never should have occurred in the first place.  And pulling out finally allows the country to get back to REALLY fighting terrorists as they should be fought--with subpoenas and indictments.  The counter argument is that Kerry's hand will be forced by events to stay in Iraq--that the pressure will simply be too great and he won't have much of a choice in the matter.  I don't buy it.  Will Kerry pull a Zapatero and pull all US forces out on Nov 5? No.  But he sure won't be itching to keep US forces in-country when UN blue-helmets could do a much better job of getting shot--and without that pesky political blowback that such events can have.  But I think that by being so overtly critical of the war and how it was handled and its wisdom, that Kerry's commitment to the endeavor can justifiably be called into question.
