THERE'S A NEW WRINKLE IN THE ANGRY LEFT PLAYBOOK .  We've gone from "Bush LIIIIIIED! to "Bush IMPLIIIIIIED!"  If this is what the DNC is banking on for November...yeesh.   **BEGIN COMPLETELY PREMATURE ELECTION PREDICTIONS**   None of the Dems are running on anything other than being "Anti-Bush." That's great for energizing the rabid angry Left, but it doesn't win general elections (see: 1996). None have offered any alternative plans for dealing with terrorism or with Iraqi reconstruction other than to say either (1) "Bush LIIIEEEED!" or (2) "Bush IMPLIIIIIED!"  It might not matter to the NYT or LAT, but nat'l security and terrorism still matter to that great swath of land known as flyover country to the elites.  Also, for all the hype about Wesley Clark, he hasn't shown anything yet and is unlikely to do so. His campaign has stalled and he's still behind Dean in NH and Iowa. He looks a lot LESS impressive in a regular suit than a general's uniform--and the uniform was his sole selling point.   As for the economy, well, that's always a tossup, but Bush I lost in 92 because the recovery that was in place hadn't yet gathered enough steam. That isn't likely to happen to GWB, the economy IS recovering (predicted 4-5% increase in GDP this year or next, can't recall) and a good number of the economic criticisms will ring hollow come election time if the economy continues on this upward trend (since by that time you should be seeing more jobs). And once you get around election time, nobody will want to hear about their taxes being raised when their economic lot is improving.  Dems NEED both the economy and Iraqi reconstruction to fail in order to win...which is rather reprehensible when you think about it. But that's how it is...  But at this early early stage in the game, I think Bush can easily defeat Dean (with Reaganite numbers), but would have a slightly tougher, but ultimately successful time against Kerry/Gephardt/Clark (like 53%-47%)
