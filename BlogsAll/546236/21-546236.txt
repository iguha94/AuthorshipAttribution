1-CLICK CONTRIBUTIONS.  Amazon lets you   donate to presidential campaigns  directly through its site.  That's darn cool.   UPDATE: Not all the candidates have yet allowed contributions through Amazon yet. Of the majors that haven't yet allowed: Bush and Lieberman.  All the other Dems allow contributions and here are their totals as of this posting:   Clark :  Since 1/23/2004 Contributions raised at Amazon.com: $3,860.00 Number of contributions received at Amazon.com: 146   Dean : Since 1/23/2004 Contributions raised at Amazon.com: $2,121.00 Number of contributions received at Amazon.com: 116   Edwards : Since 1/23/2004 Contributions raised at Amazon.com: $2,400.01 Number of contributions received at Amazon.com: 86   Kerry : Since 1/23/2004 Contributions raised at Amazon.com: $4,465.00 Number of contributions received at Amazon.com: 154   Kucinich :  Since 1/23/2004 Contributions raised at Amazon.com: $365.00 Number of contributions received at Amazon.com: 31   Sharpton :  Since 1/23/2004 Contributions raised at Amazon.com: $260.00 Number of contributions received at Amazon.com: 12  Also provided are some humorous fringe candidates like Democratic candidate   Lucian Wojciechowski   who lists  journeyman carpenter  among his prior experience.  Of course, not to be outdone, Sharpton has the trifecta of weird with:  Prior Job(s): Activist, minister,  road manager to James Brown    My favorite might be Independent candidate   Al Hamburg  who is truly a self made man:   Education: Self-educated by reading     You tell em Al!
