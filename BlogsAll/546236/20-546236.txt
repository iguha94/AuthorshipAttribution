Purdue signs wrong Jason Smith to basketball letter of intent .    Hoosier Gazette  reports:  On the first day of the early signing period for high school basketball players, Purdue used their one available scholarship to sign Yorktown High’s 5-foot-6, 128 pound Jason Smith, an honor student who has never played competitive basketball in his entire life.    Purdue had intended to sign Yorktown’s OTHER Jason Smith, a 6’6” 215 lb. point guard who averaged 26 points and 11 assists per game last season.  This Jason was named to Blue Chip Magazine’s Top 50 players in the nation.  It seems the mix up occurred in the counselor’s office Wednesday morning when the latter Jason’s scholarship papers arrived via FedEx.  Counselor Edith Woodrow mistakenly thought the documents were applications that needed to be signed and returned by the non-athletic Jason to apply for Purdue’s Sallie Mae Fund Scholarship Program, which assists low-income students with tuition and fees.   Adding to the confusion is that both Jasons share the same middle initial, “P”.  Nerdy Jason’s middle name is “Parker”, while athletic Jason’s is “Paul”. And the best part?  The Boilermakers have a serious problem on their hands.  They cannot force Jason Parker Smith to give up the scholarship without facing a great deal of bad publicity for cutting a player who has not violated team rules, and the young man does not plan on giving it up voluntarily.   And the brainy Smith says he has no qualms about keeping the scholarship since he's worked hard his whole life to earn his 3.8 GPA. Heh.
