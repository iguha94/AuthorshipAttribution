Something that struck me watching the DNC today was the general reluctance in describing the attacks on 9/11 AS attacks.  Most notably, when Glenn Close and the 9/11 widow spoke--they almost went out of their way to avoid calling them attacks.  Hillary Clinton did refer to them twice as attacks--but quickly moved on to healthcare.  I think this nicely illustrates one of the fundamental differences between how the Democrats and Republicans view both 9/11 and how to deal with it.  For Democrats, 9/11 was not an attack brought about by the willful malevolence of deranged and evil individuals.  Rather, 9/11 was an "event", a "tragedy", something that simply "happened" rather than was done to us.  Dems view 9/11 in the same way people view a natural disaster, like an earthquake or hurricane--as something that can only be regretted rather than something that can be actively prevented.  There's an obvious problem with this thinking: It's utopian lunacy.  If you deny or refuse to recognize that it is INDIVIDUALS at the controls of those planes--then you will not be willing to kill/capture/detain such individuals in the future when given the chance.  After all, you don't arrest people after a flood or an earthquake.  By refusing to acknowledge that there are whole swaths of people out there whose sole motivation is to murder as many Americans as possible, you render yourself incapable of mounting an effective war against such people.  And that's ultimately the bottom line: This is a war, not merely a "tragedy."
