That's what both Arnold and   BoiFromTroy  want.  Boi writes:   A GOP Convention with Schwarzenegger headlining--rather than Tom DeLay, for example--would go a long way towards easing reservations that financial-freedom and personal freedom-loving moderates like myself have developed recently.   I'd argue the benefits from having Arnold speaking aren't nearly so narrow.  Whatever reservations moderates like Boi may have re: "financial freedom and personal freedom" certainly won't be met by the Democratic party--so having the GOP go out of its way to appeal to those moderates (who, IMO, are just as set in who they're going to vote for than the swing voters who have yet to start paying attention) won't produce much appreciable benefit.  Were this 1996 again, then yes, such a "fiscal responsibility" approach could be the focus of an Arnold speech and it'd play well since we, as a country, didn't have a whole heck of a lot to worry about (mostly through our own negligence) beyond how much to fund HeadStart.  The 'sitch is a little different now and there are larger concerns.  Mind you, not that curbing sending isn't important--but the war is what matters--and it's ALL that matters.  That being said--Arnold should still get a whole heapload of prime time space to speak--since it really doesn't matter what the heck he says. Seriously, he could go out there and read his grocery list (lots of chicken and egg whites I bet) and it'd give Bush a big boost.
