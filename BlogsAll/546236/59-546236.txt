BFT has an   open letter to the L.A. Times  objecting to their broad-brush characterization that gays "remember Reagan with bitterness", he makes the important point:   Let't get the record straight: partisan Democrats remember Reagan with bitterness. While it is true that a preponderance of the gay political class are partisan Democrats, your paper's broad generalizations cast a stereotype on our community.    He is right to note that "Gay is not a political philosophy" any more than being black or white or short or tall is.  But keeping with the gay theme yet on a wholly unrelated note, watching   Last Comic Standing  last night, the gay guy (named Ant I think) made it to the semifinals again.  He made it that far last year too.   But as gay is neither a political philosophy, it is also not a real solid basis for a stand-up routine.  The man's entire schtick was "How gay am I? How gay do you think I am? How gay are my friends? How gay do you gay the gay?"  I never much liked comics that talk about themselves to THAT extent.  It's reptitive, fairly unoriginal (after all, how gay can you REALLY be?) and it makes the offending comic look all the more insulated in their experiences.  This is reason I never liked comics with the "white people type like this (dorky)/black people type like this (crazy)" routine.  Never liked the comics that tell me just HOW [insert ethnic group] their family is.  Now, however, I WAS glad that   Dat Phan  won last year's Last Comic Standing--but that was primarily because everyone treated him like crap--but his routine is precisely the sort of "How Vietnamese is my mom?" routine that I dislike.     Margaret Cho  does the same kind of routine, but with a twist--"How Korean is my mom? How gay are my friends? And what wacky hijinks ensue when the two clash?!"  Now how was THAT for a wholly worthless post? Eh?
