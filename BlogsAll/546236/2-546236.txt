LYNCH SNUBS RESCUER?    That's the report from the Telegraph.  Sounds a little fishy, but here's an excerpt:  Miss Lynch, portrayed as a heroine of our times for her courage while a prisoner of war, was too busy to receive the visitor, her family's lawyer said. Her saviour, Mohammed al-Rehaief, was outwardly understanding of her failure to appear during his trip. "I know she had a very difficult time in Iraq and she takes rest," he said.  However, Mr al-Rehaief, who has been granted asylum in the United States for fear of revenge attacks in Iraq, was reported to be disappointed by her failure to meet him on his visit to Palestine, West Virginia.  The Lynchs' lawyer, Stephen Goodwin, denied that rivalry between the 20-year-old former soldier and her Iraqi benefactor over competing media projects was to blame for her absence. "Absolutely not," he said.  There is an amusing aspect to the story though: But the misunderstandings were not confined to Miss Lynch's refusal to attend any of the ceremonies. Local people laid on an impressive spread at a reception to greet the al-Rehaiefs, only to discover that the family was fasting for Ramadan.  Even if the guests had been hungry they would have been unlikely, as Muslims, to tuck into the ham sandwiches on offer.  UPDATE : Lynch, through a spokesman,   here  says: "Jessica wants to meet with Mohammed, but she wants that meeting to be private, without camera or reporters present.   Jessica is confident her fellow West Virginians will understand her want for privacy and her need for time.   Jessica has a desire to meet everyone who played a role in her rescue and looks forward to doing so in due time, with an absence of fanfare."  Should I devote this entire blog to covering this story so that could be my niche? Like some blogs are econ related, others are all about corp law, etc etc? I could be all Lynch, all the time!  Or not.
