Now   this  is that sort of rebellious attitutde that rock is all about. Awesome. (found via   Andrew .   BW&BK: "Well, sometimes Americans believe they're very free, when they're sometimes not. There are a lot of authors, especially a guy like Noam Chomsky, who believes a lot of consent in the US is manufactured by politicians and corporations --"   JS: "Talk about one of the fuckin' ultra leftist spin doctors of the world, Noam Chomsky. You buy into that crap?"  BW&BK: "Well, I read a lot of his stuff."  JS: "But do you believe it all?"  BW&BK: "I have a degree in political science, so I believe some of it."  JS: "Hmm. Yeah. Well. And how old are you?"  BW&BK: "I'm 22."  JS: "22 years old? That's a lot of wisdom there! Come on, man. You know where I live? In the real world. When I was 16 years old I was living in abandoned houses and making my way into a career. Building things up from nothing without any kind of... well... socialist system to help me. That made me a very strong, independent person. I'm an independent thinker. Just because I get certain things shoved down my throat, I don't follow. I lead. Y'know what I'm saying? I look at the facts, and I base my opinions on the facts. Not the political rantings of someone like Noam Chomsky. I've got some of his books in my library. I think they're unbelievably over-the-top, like dangerously so. But that's you've got out there."  UPDATE:  Pity the quality of the music doesn't quite live up to the sentiments expressed therein...ah well.
