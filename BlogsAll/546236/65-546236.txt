Via   Mark Kilmer  comes   this story  about Michael Moore getting huffy with CNN's Bill Hemmer. The exchange itself is unremarkable (except for the general weirdness of Moore) but what struck me was the excerpt from the interview that made Moore so mad:   HEMMER: The DNC did not invite you here, is that right?  MOORE: The Congressional Black Caucus invited me here, yes. Yes.  HEMMER: Enjoy your week.  MOORE:  Those black congressmen, you know .   (emphasis mine) There's some weird attempt at validation there by Moore.  Does he think Hemmer WOULDN'T know the CBC? So why say it?  Granted, Moore has a fairly well documented   urban phobia , but his attempt (he does it often) to show that he's really fascinated by black people is simply weird.  Consider the   following :   "The kind of people who fly in airplanes want someone else to clean up their mess; that's why they let hijackers take the plane," said [Moore] late last fall in a one-man show in London. "If the passengers had included black men, those killers, with their puny bodies and unimpressive small knives, would have been crushed by the dudes, who as we all know take no disrespect from anybody. . . . The passengers on the planes on September 11 were scaredy-cats, because they were mostly white."   Aside from being a wholly tasteless slander of the   bravery  of the passengers of Flight 93, Moore's attempts to ingratiate himself so heavily into the hard-left black community just smacks of   upper-crust liberal condecension .  You almost expect Moore to quote   Randolph Duke  and say that blacks "sure are a musical people."
