LIEBERMAN'S "STREAMLINING" OR FALTERING?    Interesting report from the Forward saying that   a number of fundraisers are leaving Lieberman's campaign .  Also from the article:  As the Forward reported last week, consultant Shari Yost and Mid-Atlantic fundraising director Stephanie Friedman Schneider recently departed, in an echo of an earlier staff shakeup that operatives said was an indication that Lieberman's fundraising operation is losing steam. Add this to Joe's decision not to take part in the Iowa caucuses makes one wonder how strong (or weak) the Liberman camp is at this point.   My money is on the downward slide. And the more I think about it, the more I'm kind of depressed. I actually like Lieberman. He's the only consistently pro-war candidate up there and has repeatedly held to that position even when it was obviously unpopular to his audience.  I respect the hell out of that.    Of course, I disagree with him on mostly all his domestic politics, but that's fine. He at least has enough conviction to recognize the unique and inescapable position the US is in re: the War on Terror.  I think his is an important voice whose failure to garner support in the Democratic party (either because of his loss in 2000 or his pro-war position) speaks volumes about where the Democratic party is headed.  The Republican in me wants his campaign to falter, the American in me is sad because it is.
