JONAH GOLDBERG IS WRONG.   In a post today,   The Corner's  Jonah Goldberg writes that it appears to him that:  Berg was apparently something of a leftwing peacenik and his parents apparently belong to ANSWER. Travelling around Iraq alone the way he did is just odd.    As evidence of his claim is this   article  from the Philly Inquirier.    However, nothing in the paper’s story supports the assertion that he was a man of the left.  The article describes him as idealist (doesn’t say what ideals) and interested in the local culture (hardly a uniformly leftist trait)—indeed, nothing in the article backs up the assertion that he was of the same stripe as a Rachel Corrie (a charge Jonah lays).  With the exception of the as-yet unexplained Moussaoui link—nothing in the article backs Goldberg up.  Nick Berg may well have been an idealist conservative who rejected his father’s 1960’s liberalism (it HAS been known to happen) to take part in what he saw as a worthy cause in Iraq.  But then again, there’s nothing in the article to support THAT either.    Until there is, all we know is that Nick Berg was an American.  An American murdered by a group of pathetic cowards who, if given half the chance, would do the same to every one of us.  In some respects, that may be all we need to know.   UPDATE :  I emailed Jonah my comments and he replied back that he will be updating his post shortly.  So...I'm updating  my  post.
