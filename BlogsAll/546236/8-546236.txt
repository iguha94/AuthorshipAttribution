THE PERILS OF SOCRATES .    The Curmudgeonly Clerk  has an post decrying the Socratic Method used in near every law school.  ...everyone who has sat through a first year law school class knows that the Socratic Method is an actual impediment to learning. Any law student can regale you with tales of the inefficacy and inefficiency of this pedagogical (mal)practice.  On occasion, students do manage to exact their revenge, however. One day in my first year Criminal Law class, the professor was mercilessly grilling a rather reticent female student. He asked her to recite the facts of a case. When she began a meandering recital replete with irrelevancies, he began to mock her. He proceeded to interrogate her; each question was dripping with sarcasm and condescension. The purport of his inquiries could not have been more clear: he wanted her to focus solely on the material facts. She, however, was too befuddled and flustered to grasp his point. So the professor proceeded to the student seated next to her and asked, "Why am I mocking her?" Unfortunately for the professor, this student was honest to a fault. Without pause, he responded, "Because you are a jerk."   My thoughts: The SM can be very useful in exposing faulty or incomplete reasoning. But oftentimes profs will use the SM to throughly confuse a student and the class but then NOT PROVIDE THE RIGHT ANSWER. That borders on criminal. Yeah, we get it, we don't know the answer. We've tried, we don't know where you're going. Enough. What's the rule already?!  That's the danger of the SM, you have to take it to its completion. Socrates knew it and did it. Law profs sometimes don't and won't. Otheriwse, it just serves to confuse the hell out of lowly students trying to intuit the correct answer out of the ether, and usually getting it wrong.
