 SlingsAndArrows  notes this   LAT story  on the difficulties the UN is having in getting troops to protect its own people in Iraq.  Bryon writes:   Every week it becomes clearer that had Bush done what his critics wanted, Saddam would still be in power, people would still be dying, oil-for-money hands would still be getting greased, and families of Palestinian bombers would still be getting lucrative checks.   Clearly he does not value the PROCESS.  Silly naive little American.   On a more serious note, from the article:   If other countries are unable to provide the troops, the job will fall to the U.S.-led coalition now patrolling the country. That outcome would be embarrassing for the Bush administration, which has been struggling all year to show it has international support for rebuilding Iraq.  Why?! Why would it be embarrassing for the Bush administration? Why wouldn't it be a supreme embarassment for the UN?  For all the hectoring us conservatives rec'v when we dare question the infallible wisdom of Kofi and Co., you'd think that when they can't fulfill one of their BASIC functions (aside from condemning Israel), that they'd be rightly dismissed as yet another wholly worthless attempt at collective security.  But no, it's an embarassment for Bush.  To paraphrase Cartman: "God I hate you LAT."  UPDATE:   James Joyner at OTB  also wonders why this is an embarassment for Bush. (smart people sort of agree with me!)
