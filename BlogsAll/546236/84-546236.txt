 Raincross Conservative  points to this   AP article  noting the potential changes that Arnold's term could have on the political makeup of the state of CA.  Raincross notes:   I like the article, but I wished it would have mentioned the changing party affiliations in the state. In 2000 there were 11 percent more Democrats than Republicans in California. Now the gap is down to seven percent and could be even smaller in the years to come. This would have a dramatic effect on the state's political landscape.  Everytime I read about how Democratic CA has become, I can't help but think back to 1992 and the truly monumental effect that Ross Perot had on the American political landscape.  Think about it: California, the largest single electoral prize in the game--without which the Democrats could NEVER win the presidency was, for decades, as staunchly Republican as a state so varied could be (with the exception of Johnson's win in '64).  Now, CA is the lynchpin for the Democrats. But this wasn't always so:   1980  Reagan-- 4,524,858 Carter-- 3,862,244   1984  Reagan-- 5,305,410 Mondale--3,815,947   1988  Bush--   5,054,917 Dukakis- 4,702,233  Then came 1992.  In 1992, Ross Perot effectively split the Republican vote and this was especially true in CA:  Clinton--5,121,325 Bush--   3,630,575 Perot--  2,296,006  So instead of a staunchly Republican state--Perot effectively killed CA for the Republicans, such that Dole was thoroughly trounced in '96.  Not only did Perot help give CA to the Democrats--but by siphoning so many votes off the Republican party, he took CA off the table as even a BATTLEGROUND state.  The CA GOP is a farce and Bush is, understandably, spending no money in the state since he's unlikely to make up the 1.3 million votes he lost CA by in 2000.  Now, imagine how hamstrung the Dems would be if they had to actually FIGHT for CA?  They'd have nothing left to spend anywhere else.  It almost brings a tear to your eye.  DAMN YOU ROSS PEROT!
