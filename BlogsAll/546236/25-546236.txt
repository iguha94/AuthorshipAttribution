FINALLY FINISHED MY MOOT COURT COMPETITION BRIEF.   That's why I haven't blogged a thing in the past month.  I finished writing on Monday but spent the next two days editing.  It was an interesting topic that I am quite certain I screwed up royally on.  The questions presented were:   I.  Whether the right to procreate is fundamentally inconsistent with one’s status as a prisoner and if so, whether a restriction on that right is justified by being rationally related to the legitimate penological interests of prison safety and security.   II.  Whether a California State prison warden must recognize same sex unions performed in another state under the Equal Protection, Due Process, or Full Faith and Credit Clauses of the U.S. Constitution.   I was assigned the side of the Respondent (the State) and argued the state (California) does not have to let a prisoner procreate while in prison and that it need not recognize his Vermont civil union.    You can see the brief here and remind me of all the typos I missed and cases I ignored.   Here are my point headings:   I.  THE RIGHT TO PROCREATE UNDER DUE PROCESS DOES NOT SURVIVE INCARCERATION BECAUSE IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY INCONSISTENT WITH ONE’S STATUS AS A PRISONER.  A.  IMPRISONMENT NECESSARILY LIMITS A PRISONER’S RIGHTS TO MARRIAGE AND INTIMATE ASSOCIATION B.  A PRISONER’S RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM FORCED STERILIZATION DOES NOT TRANSLATE INTO A RIGHT TO PROCREATE WHILE INCARCERATED   II.  EVEN IF THE RIGHT TO PROCREATE SURVIVES INCARCERATION, ITS RESTRICTION IS VALID AS IT IS REASONABLY RELATED TO THE LEGITIMATE PENOLOGICAL INTERESTS OF PRISON SECURITY AND SAFETY  A.  RESTRICTING INMATE PROCREATION FOR PRISON SAFETY SATISFIES  TURNER’S  REASONABLENESS INQUIRY B. REQUIRING PRISONER PROCREATION WOULD UNDULY BURDEN PRISON STAFF AND THERE ARE NO READY ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE TO THE PRISON   III.  THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE DOES NOT REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF SAME-SEX UNIONS BECAUSE HOMOSEXUALITY IS NOT A SUSPECT CLASSIFICATION ENTITLED TO HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY  A.  EQUAL PROTECTION PERMITS LEGISLATIVE CLASSIFICATIONS THAT DISADVANTAGE GROUPS OR PERSONS B.  HOMOSEXUALITY HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN HELD TO BE A NON-SUSPECT CLASSIFICATION ENTITLED TO NO MORE THAN RATIONAL BASIS REVIEW C.  THE STATE’S RESTRICTION ON SAME-SEX UNIONS SATISFIES RATIONAL BASIS REVIEW D.  NEITHER VERMONT’S  BAKER  DECISION NOR MASSACHUSETTS’  GOODRIDGE  DECISION FOUND A RIGHT TO SAME-SEX UNIONS UNDER FEDERAL LAW   IV.  DUE PROCESS DOES NOT REQUIRE THE STATE TO RECOGNIZE SAME-SEX UNIONS BECAUSE THE ABILITY TO MARRY ONE OF THE SAME SEX IS NOT A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT  A.  THE DECISION IN  LOVING V. VIRGINIA  CANNOT BE EXTENDED TO INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO MARRY ONE OF THE SAME SEX BECAUSE THE FREEDOM TO MARRY WAS PREDICATED ON THE FREEDOM TO PROCREATE  B.  THE DECISION IN  LAWRENCE V. TEXAS  DID NOT CREATE A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MARRY ONE OF THE SAME SEX C.   LAWRENCE  WAS LIMITED TO THE CRIMINALIZTION OF PRIVATE CONDUCT, NOT THE RECOGNITION OF SAME-SEX UNIONS   V.  THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT CLAUSE RECOGNITION OF SAME-SEX UNIONS BECAUSE IT VIOLATES CALIFORNIA’S LEGITIMATE PUBLIC POLICY AND FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE SUCH RECOGNITION    So there you have it. I think I did a halfway decent job. Though we shall see by March 22...then I get to argue both sides on oral argument and not advance to the next round of the competition. Heh.
