 Rusty   at MyPetJawa has some thoughts on "Wars of Necessity" stemming from this post by   Matt Yglesias .  Yglesias thinks that both the Revolution and WWII were "wars of necessity" rather than "wars of choice."  Rusty writes:    What, exactly, is meant by 'War of Necessity' anyway? For example, can anyone really argue that the actions taken by the Jefferson administration against the North African city-states were 'necessary' for the survival of the country? Was that not a 'war-of-choice' and not of 'necessity?    I think even Yglesias is stretching a bit with his inclusion of WWII as a war of necessity.  After all, the criterion chosen seems to be that a war of necessity is such only where it's a response to a direct attack.  But even then, the state is still CHOOSING to respond.  That it was attacked might make the state's choice more morally justified--but it still was a choice.  Using the two examples Yglesias provides--WWII and the Revolution:  the US could have easily let Imperial Japan control the Pacific and have been content to cede dominance of that ocean to her.  On the European front--the US again could have let Germany run roughshod over Europe without much of a threat to US security.  Now, this would have been a morally indefensible decision--but it was still a decision that the US was able to make.    Indeed, the American Revolutionaries could simply have chosen to stay British subjects.  That breaking off from Britain was a GOOD decision doesn't negate the fact it was still a choice they made.  For my money, no war is a war of necessity.  They are ALL wars of choice--but that fact alone doesn't invalidate that such a choice was made.
