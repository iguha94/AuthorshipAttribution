 Via Gamespy.  Here's a brief description of the three main city areas in the game:    Los Santos : Populated by the rich and famous, as well as the down-and-out, Los Santos is Rockstar North's interpretation of modern-day Los Angeles. Movie stars and millionaire rich kids strut their stuff in expensive rides, while the less-savory individuals hang out in their ghetto homesteads, peddling death and destruction. CJ's home, family, and former gang resides in Los Santos, and its here that GTA: San Andreas kicks off for real.    San Fierro : Sources indicate that CJ will travel to the city of San Fierro after spending the first part of the game in his home city of Los Santos. San Fierro is based on San Francisco, so it's safe to assume that CJ might be in for a little bad weather. Look for a tight knit cityscape, and smaller, more foreboding suburbs.    Las Venturas : Just like our own loveable sin city Las Vegas, GTA: San Andreas' third main city is Las Venturas. A place where any fool with a few bucks can get rich gambling in the casinos, or a place where the rich and famous can go bust in the course of one evening, Las Venturas has something for everyone. It's also the third and final stop that we know of where CJ will get in on some action.   With the exception of Half Life 2--I'm looking forward to this game most of all.
