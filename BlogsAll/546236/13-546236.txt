LIL AMBER & JOHN ASHCROFT:   We were discussing  ASHCROFT V. FREE SPEECH COALITION , 535 U.S. 234 (2002).  I was somewhat less than prepared.  Well, really the only thing I missed was why  New York v. Ferber  458 U.S. 747 (1982) wasn't controlling.   Thing was, I had already done this case in 1st Amendment Law and knew it, I just couldn't believe the Professor had gotten through the class list a full second time.  Hell, he already called on me the week before darn it!  Eh, I redeemed myself reasonably well I think when I noted that the Court said that if Congress wanted to prevent the conduct that this virtual child porn led to (exploitation, seduction, etc), it should have criminalized the conduct itself, not the protected speech.   Then again, maybe not.    **END LAME ATTEMPT TO COVER ONE'S ASS** **BEGIN SEMI-SUBSTANTIVE POST**   Ok, so while I understand that you can't ban visual depictions that  appear  to be of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, what do we say about sites like   Lil Amber  and similar "teen modeling" sites that seems pretty clearly directed towards a prurient interest (even if they may not wholly satisfy the  Miller  obscenity standards of being patently offensive and lacking serious social/literary/etc value)?  Can't such sites be constitutionally classified, by statute, as being child pornography? Or do such statutory definitions also fall prey to a  Miller -like analysis--at least in terms of sweeping in too much protected speech. (I.E., is the overbreadth hurdle easier to get over when defining child porn--so long as it involves REAL children?)   **UPDATE**  I went to the mountaintop (  Prof. Volokh ) and asked him the same question. Response is that  United States v. Knox , 32 F.3d 733 is on point. Case involved a prosecution under a federal child porn statute for possesion of videos that had minors in provacative poses in "abbreviated" clothing.  To quote LEXIS:  "The court affirmed the defendant's conviction, because the federal child pornography statute did not contain a requirement that the child subject's genitals or pubic area be fully or partially exposed or discernible, and the requirement of lasciviousness applied to the exhibition of the child's body rather any act, pose, or intent on the part of the child subject."
