After watching John Edwards'   speech  last night, I have come to the conclusion that I have absolutely no incentive to finish law school.  None.  I have neither incentive nor desire to work hard, to make more money than we currently do, or to eventually move out of our apartment into a home.    I have no desire to do this because I fear that should I become moderately succesfful, I will be punished like a mofo for it.  I don't want to earn over $200K, because that would place me in that "other America" where all gains are clearly ill-gotten.   I don't want to be in that other America.    I want to find the dignity in working my ass off and being unable to save because I spend too much money on luxury items.  I want to place myself on a pedestal for running up thousands in credit card debt, not for essentials, but because I didn't think to save one stinking dime.  I want to approach each day with a stoicism that is exceeded only by my bitching about being unable to afford a 3rd TV for my poverty level home.   John edwards has given me hope.  Hope that if I work hard enough and keep my nose to the grindstone long enough, that his gov't will rape the holy hell out of my wallet.   Not in MY America, bucko.
