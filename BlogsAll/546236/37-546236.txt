With news that   Iraq will charge Saddam with war crimes , I am wondering how the media will cover the proceedings.  I see several options as possible--dependent on a couple things.  (1) The indictment will be covered somewhat sparingly with very little elaboration or detailed analysis--since well, we all KNOW that Saddam was a bad guy. (just   "not enough"  of one) And we don't need to be REMINDED of that uncomfortable fact.  (2) The trial coverage will depend on its timing.  From NYT:   How soon the trials of the 12 will begin remained uncertain; Dr. Allawi said Mr. Hussein's would not begin "for a number of months."   If it's BEFORE the US election--it will get far less coverage than if it happens after the election.  However, if the trial occurs before November, it still may get a decent amount of coverage IF it's laden with all sorts of gruesome photos and videos (though if they are TOO gruesome, the media can claim they don't want to be "excessive" in their coverage--as they interview Michael Jackson's former pool cleaner's ex-roommate's cousin)  (3) The main mitigating factor (aside from press bias against broadcasting much of anything that might redound to Bush's benefit) in the level of coverage of Saddam's trial will be the fact that the trial will be in ARABIC.  You can't have wall-to-wall coverage with nothing but monotone translators screwing up every fifth word.  So we will likely see far less coverage proportionally of the Saddam trial than we do of the Peterson or Kobe trials.  And (4) I may well be talking out of my ass--but this is how I see things stacking up: I see the news nets giving it about 60% of the coverage they are currently giving other high profile cases with and upside of about 80% depending on the salaciousness of the details and a downside of about 35% depending on the political ramifications (i.e. good for Bush) and language barriers.
