 Stephen Taylor of Poliblog  finds the   Alliance of Digital Brownshirts  "too creepy to be funny" and suggests that Nazis are only funny in Mel Brooks musicals (though why Hogan's Heroes doesn't qualify, I don't know)  While I get his general argument, I ultimately disagree.  It would be one thing if the ADB just kind of formed out of thin air--which would indicate SOME independent affinity for the concept of brownshirts and Nazi imagery.  But in this case, Al Gore made such a baseless and patently stupid analogy that to embrace it as some bloggers have done merely underscores the ridiculousness of it.  Basicaly, in comparing bloggers/conservative pundits/etc to Nazis, Gore set such a LOW standard for what qualifies as being a jackbooted thug that to embrace the imagery in an ironic way poses no problem and merely exposes people that make such facially absurd analogies to be the tools they are.  (Kind of like an inverted  Le Monde  headline: "We are all Hitler now"  After all, if everything (at least in Gore's fevered little Homer Simpson Treehouse of Horror "The Shinning" mind) on the other side of the spectrum qualifies as being equivalent to Nazism, well, you certainly can't ARGUE your way out of that--better to just have a little Photoshop fun and make light of it.  SIDENOTE: And to prove that Nazis can be funny outside of Mel Brooks musicals:  One day me and some law school guys were playing basketball, somebody makes some offhand and totally inoffensive remark about WWII...  Me: "Hey fuck you man, my grandpa died at Auschwitz." *awkward silence* *awkward silence* *awkward silence* *awkward silence* *awkward silence* *awkward silence* Me: "Yeah, he fell off the guard tower."  Now that's funny.
