ARE THE COURTS INADVERTENTLY HARMING THE GAY RIGHTS CAUSE ? Prof Volokh has an interesting post which present a   very plausible scenario :  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decides that the state constitution secures a right to gay marriage. (Happened.) This substantially energizes and strengthens the pro-Federal Marriage Amendment forces, who are upset at what they see as 'judicial activism,' in any state, even one that's not their own. (Very likely, despite my post a few posts down; without the Defense of Marriage Act, it would have been nearly certain, I think, but now it's just very likely.)       The FMA is proposed and passes, because right now gay marriage is still not popular. (Quite likely.) The FMA prohibits all gay marriage, including that enacted by legislatures or the voters. (Quite likely; that's overbroad with respect to the interest in preventing judicial activism, but it's the current draft, which shows that some people like it -- and I doubt that most voters will focus too much on these details.) Ten, twenty, or thirty years from now, when people no longer object much to gay marriage (quite possible, given the trajectory of attitudes towards gay issues, and see here [thanks to InstaPundit for the pointer]), gay marriage will be constitutionally banned, and the constitutional prohibition will be very hard to undo (certain, given these hypotheses). And in the meantime, the symbolic message sent by the law will be 'gay marriage is so bad that the Constitution outlaws it' (depends on what you think of symbolism, but it seems to me quite likely).   **UPDATE**   BoiFromTroy  has many links to reactions and analyses of the Mass. decision.
