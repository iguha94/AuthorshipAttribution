WINDOWS BFD.    Microsoft gives an early look at next Windows .  The next version of the ubiquitous PC software will come with a new "sidebar" running down one side of the screen. The sidebar, which stays visible while the PC user works in an application, can show things like a "buddy list" of contacts, display a slide show of photographs or receive other types of media.  At the heart of the next Windows will be a new format for storing data that Microsoft has worked on intermittently for more than a decade. Rather than each software application saving information in a different format, a new standardised file system known as WinFS will create a single, unified system.  That means users will be able to find any information on their own PCs or across their corporate networks with a single search, then collate different types of data, whether in the form of text documents, spread sheets, video or audio recordings, Microsoft executives said.  Other key technologies in Longhorn will include a more powerful 3D graphics capability known as Avalon, which has been adapted from high-performance computer game systems, and a communications technology called Indigo, which will let users integrate information from other sources with data held on their desktops.  Some of the features do sound kind of cool, but damn it, y'all better prove to me its worth it. (granted, XP might be a dinosaur by 2006--the new OS' expected ship date)  Wanna know the best part? The name of this new OS is....   Longhorn.   *snicker*
