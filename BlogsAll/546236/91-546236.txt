Ok, my concern is this--most of Bush's speeches these days center on justifying of his decision to go to war with the information that he had  at the time .   But I'm still not sure what his answer is to whether, knowing what we know now re: WMD (no stockpiles, flawed intel), would he still have gone to war? My gut says he'd say yes given the links to AQ, but I'm not sure if that's politically wise--not sure it's UNWISE, but just throwing it out there.  &nbsp;  Does saying he would not have invaded invalidate the case for war?&nbsp; I don't really think so--it certainly doesn't HELP though since so much of the public case was based on the presence of WMD (IMO, the war was still justified on other grounds, but I'm just concerned with how it all "looks")  &nbsp;  On the other side, doesn't saying he WOULD have invaded make him APPEAR (at least to some) as if he was obsessed with Iraq when there were arguably better (?) candidates for targeting (  Iran for example ).  &nbsp;  I don't doubt this question will come up in the debates, and I'm honestly unsure of how Bush will answer it or what the collective reaction will be.  &nbsp;  (this post was prompted by this   excellent post  from   PatioPundit  trying to discern what Kerry's position would have been with the info available at the time)
