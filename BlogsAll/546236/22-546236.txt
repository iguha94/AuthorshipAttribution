RANDY BARNETT AT LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL.       Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty   Wednesday, March 3 5:00-6:00pm Loyola Law School--Hall of the 80s 919 S. Albany Street Los Angeles CA   Featuring :  Randy Barnett , Boston University School of Law  With Commentary by :  Kurt Lash , Loyola Law School Admission is Free, All are Welcome  The Loyola Law School Chapter of the Federalist Society is proud to host Professor  Randy Barnett  as he talks about his new book,  Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty  with commentary by Loyola Law School Professor  Kurt Lash .   The U.S. Constitution found in school textbooks and under glass in Washington is not the one enforced today by the Supreme Court. In  Restoring the Lost Constitution , Randy Barnett argues that since the nation's founding, but especially since the 1930s, the courts have been cutting holes in the original Constitution and its amendments to eliminate the parts that protect liberty from the power of government. From the Commerce Clause, to the Necessary and Proper Clause, to the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, to the Privilege or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court has rendered each of these provisions toothless. In the process, the written Constitution has been lost.  Please join us this Wednesday, March 3, from 5-6pm in the Hall of the 80s as these two distinguished scholars discuss this interesting and important topic.
