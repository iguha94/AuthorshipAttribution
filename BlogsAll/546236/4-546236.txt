WE'RE A FAST MOVIN' TRAIN BABY--CLIMB ABORD .   College students have become more conservative than the general population, according to a new poll  According to a poll released this week by Harvard University's Institute of Politics, college students generally support President Bush, and they lean slightly Republican in political persuasion -- a contrast to the commonly held stereotype of radical campus liberals.  But while 46 percent of students agree that the country is on the right track, they remain politically conflicted. In the past year, their trust in the president declined as concerns grew about Iraq. They aren't oblivious to the world around them, the poll suggests; instead, they are worried about the state of the economy and about finding jobs. And today's students aren't political "slackers"; they say they are poised to become active in the 2004 election -- if asked.  "Most campaigns are geared toward voters with an immediate economic stake in the election," said Dan Glickman, director of Harvard University's Institute of Politics and a former U.S. agriculture secretary. "Young people don't have a voting track record, and the regular way of campaigning often misses this group."  More than two-thirds of the students surveyed are registered to vote -- and eight in 10 said they would vote in 2004. As a whole, 18- to 24-year-olds are less than half as likely to vote as college students. Perhaps surprisingly, 31 percent of college students identify themselves as Republicans, while 27 percent call themselves Democrats and 38 percent independent or unaffiliated.
