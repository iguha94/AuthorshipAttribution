Ok, so we've got a new   L.A. Times Poll  that shows Kerry with a 51-44 lead in a head to head and a 48-42 with Nader in the race.  Neverminding the fact that the poll is only of registered voters (rather than the more reliable likely voters)--hell, I think my neighbor's dog is registered to vote.  Though I don't think he'll vote, he's more into local elections.    Ok, so there's that--but Andrew Sullivan does a little bit of projection when he writes on his site:   KERRY'S LEAD WIDENS: I don't think this has anything to do with Kerry. It has to do with a collapse of confidence in the president's competence. I'm unsurprised.    There's no analysis, no even moderate skepticism, nothing to suggest that since   this poll is so out balls-out-inconsistent with other polls currently out there  that it might not be the best thing to hang one's hat one. Case is point:   Bush with an eleven point lead in Missouri? Not a chance. Even the biggest Bush booster in the country wouldn't claim that the President would win the Show-Me State by double digits as things stand right now. The latest polls show Bush has, at best, a tiny lead over Kerry.  In Ohio, three consecutive polls conducted during the last three weeks - including a Mason-Dixon one with a pretty big sample - show Bush with a small lead, but the LA Times has Kerry up by three.   Likewise, the last three polls in Wisconsin - albeit two from Zogby's online operation and one by a Dem firm - have Kerry ahead by sizeable margins. The LA Times has Bush up two. I suppose it's possible Bush has a small lead in Wisconsin, but not likely. With only two exceptions over the past three months (both Badger polls which I've been told over samples Republicans, by the way) the state has been leaning toward Kerry.    Nope we get none of that--we get "I'm unsurprised." In short, Sullivan is reading into this poll his own schizophrenic and ultimately unreliable political biases into the poll.  Blahhh....
