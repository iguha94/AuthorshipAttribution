THE FRENCH INSTANT MESSENGING MIND.   While outlining Business Associations--I rec'd a random Instant Message from a person from France which resulted in a fairly interesting (to see the European mind at work) conversation re: free speech, presidential power, and ultimately....Kyoto.  Some of his/her phrasings show something of a problem with the language, but you get the idea. Here it is (long, but amusing if you get through it):   Cycy1384 : hi  CXCross : evening  Cycy1384 : morning lol  CXCross : not quite yet  Cycy1384 : depends where u live  CXCross : I'm in Los Angeles, you?  Cycy1384 : Lyon   Cycy1384 : hum do u know where it is?  CXCross : France?  Cycy1384 : woow good  CXCross : :-)  Cycy1384 : u impress me  CXCross : Hey, thanks :-P  Cycy1384 : u're welcome  Cycy1384 : not a lot of merican knows   CXCross : I wonder how Americans do...  Cycy1384 : u surely dunno why i imed u   CXCross : Surely  Cycy1384 : lolol  Cycy1384 : i found u in the law list lol  CXCross : Ahh  Cycy1384 : yah some people know how to use the icone " find a buddy" lol  CXCross : So why law? :-P  Cycy1384 : hummm   CXCross : I mean, I get lots of IM's from dumbass 16 yr olds asking me if they get busted with pot, how much trouble are they in?  Cycy1384 : i think   Cycy1384 : fortunately that i dunno what means busted with pot lol  CXCross : arrested for marijuana posession  Cycy1384 : ohhhhhh  Cycy1384 : and they come to knowwhat?  Cycy1384 : they're guilty ..  CXCross : generally  Cycy1384 : i'm a student in politcal sciences and law  CXCross : Undergraduate?  Cycy1384 : and i wanted a point of view   CXCross : on?  Cycy1384 : but an american one  Cycy1384 : 2 nd year  CXCross : right, but not yet in law school I mean, right?  Cycy1384 : law school   Cycy1384 : i wonder if its really existing over here  CXCross : So what did you want a point of view on?  Cycy1384 : humm i had a partiel   Cycy1384 : and the subject ( all in english argh ) was nearly that :  Cycy1384 : is public figures need protection from media for emotional distress more than people have the freedom of speech and say everything   Cycy1384 : we had as example the case of larry flynt  CXCross : I disagree. People are public figures usually by their own efforts and actions--one of the costs of placing yourself into the public realm is that you open yourself up to criticism/insults/language--usually very harsh criticism/language.  Cycy1384 : lol u agree with everyone except me   Cycy1384 : i'm the only one for 280 people saying : well i totally agree   Cycy1384 : and that the reason why i came to talk to u lol   CXCross : For a "priviate" individual who has NOT placed themselves in the public sphere--then their right to privacy trumps the public's right to say anything about them--because they have not availed themselves to the public--they still should be able to claim emotional distress  CXCross : For my part, it's a first amendment/freedom of speech thing  Cycy1384 : yah the first amendement   Cycy1384 : i said we have to limit it ..  Cycy1384 : i proposed that even if ur a public figure , u have a private life and we cant criticize everything like we can see for the american election   CXCross : It is limited already  Cycy1384 : well larry flynt won   CXCross : Right, but he wasn't the one claiming emotional distress  CXCross : Jerry Falwell was  Cycy1384 : yah true  Cycy1384 : for me jerry falwell was right  CXCross : And Falwell--by virtue of his public status--could not claim emotional distress  CXCross : without a showing of actual malice  CXCross : if I recall correctlyu  Cycy1384 : but a public figure is an human being nah?  CXCross : took 1st amendment law last semester  CXCross : Right, which is why we can't just kill them  Cycy1384 : hum jerry wasnot guilty of nothing yet   Cycy1384 : why he cant be protected ?  CXCross : Jerry was the plaintiff  CXCross : he was suing Larry  Cycy1384 : true  Cycy1384 : but for me larry needed to be going in jail for that   CXCross : Nah--while distasteful--that is something of the price one pays for entering into the public arena  Cycy1384 : I disagree   Cycy1384 : i think we are in the point   Cycy1384 : because we are a public figure we have to accept all critizies , insults and all?  CXCross : Not all--just most.  Cycy1384 : god lol  CXCross : If someone made overt threats of violence...that'd be illegal  CXCross : or attempted to incite violence against you...that's illegal too  Cycy1384 : i explained in my copy , that i dont accept that because i'm european lol do u think the corrector will kik me?  Cycy1384 : but for me , just claiming rumor is illegal   CXCross : Well, I'd argue that Europe and the US have fairly divergent histories when it comes to freedom of speech and its limits on it  Cycy1384 : yah   Cycy1384 : dont u think american law is scaring?  CXCross : Scary? Not at all  CXCross : I happen to like it  Cycy1384 : u know we were shocked by monica lewinsky story   CXCross : I don't doubt it. But I do doubt that you heard the full story  Cycy1384 : well one of my friend told me , people were not well with the president only cause he lied   CXCross : The issue regarding Clinton's impeachment was not that he had sex...but rather that he lied about it UNDER OATH.  CXCross : In a judicial proceeding  Cycy1384 : but at the begining its is private life nah?  CXCross : It was his private life--but it was also the subject of an authorized investigation arising out of a civil suit for sexual harassment  Cycy1384 : i still think it s scarying yet lol   CXCross : Just because it's your private life doesn't mean you can be compelled to testify about it  CXCross : "Where were you last night?"  Cycy1384 : well we never talk about our president over here  CXCross : "Sorry, that's my private life"  CXCross : Because you have parliamentary system, yes? President doesn't matter much overall  Cycy1384 : president is powerfull   Cycy1384 : not as ur yet for sure   CXCross : Our president isn't any more powerful than was Bill Clinton  CXCross : Or George Bush, or Reagan, or Carter, Nixon, etc etc  Cycy1384 : but ur president did things clinton never did   CXCross : That's true, but uninformative  Cycy1384 : uninformative?  CXCross : Clinton did things Bush never did...  Cycy1384 : lolol   Cycy1384 : I SEE WHAT U MEAN lol   CXCross : The statement, without more, means nothing  Cycy1384 : but clinton was good for the international scene  Cycy1384 : whereas bush wow   CXCross : Clinton did very little for int'l scene  Cycy1384 : HE DID well for isrealo palestinian conflit   CXCross : He went into Haiti, Kosovo, and bombed Iraq all without UN approval...  CXCross : No, he brokered a deal that Arafat rejected.  CXCross : He rejected Kyoto (as did our Senate, 99 to nothing)  Cycy1384 : kyoto is a wordl treaty   Cycy1384 : we still are shocked by this rejection   CXCross : To which the US has not ratified  Cycy1384 : here we think the usa are collapsing slowly   CXCross : We're not. Kyoto exempts both China and India and would cost the US about $150 billion a year and, at best, would delay temperature increases by 6 years  CXCross : I.E. the temp it would be in 2100 WITHOUT Kyoto we would reach in 2106 WITH Kyoto  Cycy1384 : but china and india are not verywealthy   CXCross : But they are VERY polluting  CXCross : because they are not very wealthy  Cycy1384 : true but the fact is that we have to be an example   CXCross : Then have Europe be an example...nobody is stopping you  Cycy1384 : how can we critik polluting countries if we did  Cycy1384 : we are in late sure , but we are doing our maximum and it works lol  CXCross : So then you're setting a fine example...and once you get China and India on board and can ensure that our standard of living will remain comparable after implementing Kyoto--we'll sign on  CXCross : and that it won't place such a large dent in our economy...  Cycy1384 : so the superpower of the world will try to not pollute only when poor countries will be more wealthy?  Cycy1384 : BUT u 're only talking about economy, economy is not all yet nah?  CXCross : Eh, it's a biggie. But suppose the US completely eliminates its pollution--that won't make one difference for countries like India and China--who will continue to pollute as much as they want  CXCross : Basicaly, there's not a good enough reason for the US to sign on to Kyoto.  Cycy1384 : yeah but u 'll able to impose ur way   CXCross : How?  Cycy1384 : because u stop polluting , u ARE the superpower   Cycy1384 : all other powers are trying to stop polluting  Cycy1384 : so that's pression   CXCross : Not China or India  Cycy1384 : china against the rest of the world , they will lose  CXCross : Our stopping polluting doesn't change how they act at all  CXCross : Lose what?  CXCross : What do they lose?  Cycy1384 : but the us is poluting more than china yet   Cycy1384 : they will lose the fact of poluting , they will be force to stop that  Cycy1384 : because of the superpower stop , other powers stop  CXCross : True--but out economy is also much much larger--we produce much more and in comparison to the size of our ecnonomy--we produce not that much pollution  CXCross : China is a superpower...why will they stop?  Cycy1384 : china is not   Cycy1384 : well not again lol  CXCross : Why will they be forced to stop polluting?  Cycy1384 : here we are afraid of china more than america lol  CXCross : If they haven't signed on to Kyoto--why will they be forced to stop polluting  CXCross : (as you should be)  Cycy1384 : because of the rest of the wealthy world will force them doing it   Cycy1384 : if everyone stop poluting   CXCross : How?  Cycy1384 : they will be force  CXCross : As in, war?  Cycy1384 : nahhhhh   Cycy1384 : already the war lol  CXCross : What kind of force then?  Cycy1384 : dont be so extremist lol  Cycy1384 : spiritual force   CXCross : ...  Cycy1384 : then political force  CXCross : What the hell is "spiritual force"?  Cycy1384 : then we can conclude a treaty   Cycy1384 : lmao lol   CXCross : Why would they sign the treaty? What are they being threatened with?  Cycy1384 : spiritual force is the meaning of everyone know that's bad  CXCross : Yeah but so what?  Cycy1384 : people can become demonstrator   Cycy1384 : and we will help demonstrator  CXCross : Suppose China says "we don't care what you think"  CXCross : Then what?  Cycy1384 : then we can stop buying all things from china   Cycy1384 : economic blocus is possible  CXCross : No we can't--they produce too many goods  Cycy1384 : china is really dependant  CXCross : As are Western countries on China  Cycy1384 : humm not really   CXCross : you can't boycott china  Cycy1384 : japan is dependant of nothing   Cycy1384 : europe is military dependant of america   CXCross : And their economy is in the shitter  CXCross : (japan's)  Cycy1384 : the usa is dependant of the world lol  Cycy1384 : japan is not that well cause they are changing their ways   CXCross : No, they've been this way for the past decade  Cycy1384 : but that a real good example of a regulated crisis  Cycy1384 : oh u know what it was a long time i never have fun talking to an american wow that's so rare   Cycy1384 : i have to remercier u lol  CXCross : likewise  Cycy1384 : even if some expressions are still a mystery for me lol  There you have it...take it for what you will.
