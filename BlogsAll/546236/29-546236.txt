MOOT COURT COMPETITION UPDATE.   Well, took part in the Moot Court semi-finals today.  I thought I did markedly better than my opponent in my first round, but the judges laid most of their comments on me.  The most consistent criticism I get these days is that I speak too quickly.  Every judge has thus far admitted I have excellent speakings skills and a great presence up there, but I just talk a little too quickly.  I think this springs from the fact that I know what I'm talking about and want to get as much out there.  I've tried really hard to slow down...but doing so makes me sound retarded.   Also I think the fact that I speak quickly is that my Petitioner's argument simply has MORE information in it and I want to be able to get my points out there despite being peppered with questions (granted, the benches today were fairly "cold")  My second round went much better, as Respondent, I have more time (10 min v 8 min) and less information to get through and it's also easier to make it a more "impassioned" argument on Respondent's side.  But yeah, my second round argument went very well, the judges even set me up with such an easy softball I couldn't help making a joke out of it that actually got a laugh out of the justices.  Will my second round be sufficient to offset my perceived poor 1st round showing and help me make the team? (the top 16 of 32 make the team with 2 alternates)  Perhaps.  Though I think it's pretty certain I will not be among the top four who will go on to determine who the "Top Oralist" of the competition is.
