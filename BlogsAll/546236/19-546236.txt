NOTE TO SELF: NEVER WIN THE LOTTERY.    Richest lottery winner wishes he'd been quieter .    The letters never stop. Requests, pleas, hard-luck stories, tales to break your heart: thousands of them, enough to fill hip-high filing cabinets that line three conference-room walls in Andrew "Jack" Whittaker's new office.   They come by the dozens, day after day, though it has been a year since Whittaker won the richest undivided lottery jackpot in U.S. history -- $314.9 million, payable in an after-tax lump sum of $113 million -- in a Christmas Day drawing.   "I can't even read them," Whittaker said. "I wouldn't have any money left if I did." Two words:  Cat Juggling   Now, as sympathetic as one can feel towards a man with $314 million dollars, there's this:  During a July foray to a West Virginia strip club, Whittaker opened a briefcase filled with $545,000 in cash and cashier's checks in front of a club employee. Whittaker was soon drugged, and the briefcase was stolen, police said.   The money was found, and two club employees were arrested.   But the incident put a spotlight on Whittaker's habits, which police said included frequent strip-club visits and high-stakes gambling at a dog track and casino.   Of course, the article does say his business has expanded, he's hired more people and given about $7m to charity...sooo....*I* am willing for forgive the dumbness of the strip club fiasco. Isn't that big of me?
