WHAT ABOUT SIXTO?!   Mickey Kaus:   Bush is Pedro Martinez .  Not a bad metaphor drawn by Mickey from the  Rock the Vote!  Democratic debate.  The gist is that Bush is like Pedro in game 7 of the ALCS and the voters are Grady Little. Bush was our starter who has given us 7+ strong innings, but he's tiring now and we may need to bring in a fresh arm before he gives up a double to Matsui. (While I think Bush/Pedro still can give us a CG, it's a fun metaphor nonetheless)  Now this got me a-thinkin...if Bush is Pedro, who are the Democratic candidates?   John Kerry --  Joe Niekro . Not quite Hall of Fame Material, but put up respectable numbers using a pitch that waffles back and forth.   Wesley Clark --Michael Jordan. Banked on his basketball talent to get him a minor league contract. Potential to evolve into either a   Bo Jackson  or a   Deion Sanders . Both more answers to trivia questions than anything.    Rev. Al Sharpton --  Razor Shines . Cup-of-coffee guy whose only real appeal was a cool name.   Dennis Kucinich --The "player to be named later" in   Dick Radatz'  threat during a fight that he'd take on his diminutive opponent and "player to be named later."  Either that or   Bill "Spaceman" Lee .   Carol-Mosley Braun --Any one of the   Colorado Silver Bullets    Howard Dean --  Walt Weiss . Rookie of the Year. Impressive in his first outing, but unlikely to make a lasting impression on the game.    Dick Gephardt --  Mike Morgan.   Been around the game so long it's hard to imagine him NOT playing, or losing. He could have been   Jesse Orosco , but he never put up quite good enough numbers.   John Edwards --  Darren Dreifort .  Young, good looking, lots of hype. And a 47-56 record with a 4.36 ERA.   Joe Lieberman --  Kevin Gross . Nice guy. Had his moment in the sun as an All Star in 1988 as well as a no-no later in his career, but engenders no passion or solid fan base otherwise.
