Ok, the report of   Sandy Berger being the subject of a DOJ criminal investigation  for the apparent wrongful (though unclear if intentional) removal of classified terroism docs is all over the blog world right now.   Berger's home and office were searched earlier this year by FBI agents armed with warrants after he voluntarily returned documents to the National Archives. However, still missing are some drafts of a sensitive after-action report on the Clinton administration's handling of al-Qaida terror threats during the December 1999 millennium celebration.   Berger and his lawyer said Monday night he knowingly removed handwritten notes he had made while reading classified anti-terror documents at the archives by sticking them in his jacket and pants. He also inadvertently took copies of actual classified documents in a leather portfolio, they said.   While I am inclined to give Berger the benefit of the doubt, things like this do not instill confidence:   When asked, Berger said he returned some classified documents that he found in his office and all of the handwritten notes he had taken from the secure room, but could not locate two or three copies of the highly classified millennium terror report.   While normally I'd be quick to question how the media would report this, the fact that the AP is breaking the story as an exclusive places it in a different light than would a run of the mill story with a buried lede (lead?).  As of right now, we'll just have to wait and see.  I have nothing meaningful to add--I just couldn't resist the title of this post...  UPDATE:   Wizbang  has more on the NYT's "reporting" of the story
