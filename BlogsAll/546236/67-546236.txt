Via   Irish Lass  comes   this wonderful story  about Teresa Heinz Kerry telling a reporter to "Shove it" after being reminded of what she said in a speech not a few minutes prior.  "We need to turn back some of the creeping, un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits that are coming into some of our politics," she told her fellow Pennsylvanians at a Sunday night reception at the Massachusetts Statehouse.  Minutes later, Colin McNickle, the editorial page editor of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, questioned her on exactly what she meant by the term "un-American," according to a tape of the encounter recorded by WTAE Channel 4 Action News.  Heinz Kerry said "I didn't say that" several times to McNickle. She then turned to confer with Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and others. When she faced McNickle again a short time later, he continued to question her, and she replied, "You said something I didn't say. Now shove it."  Make sure you click on the link--it's got the full video, both with her speech where she clearly DOES say "un-American" and her repeated denials.  But here's something else, it should be disturbingly clear that it isn't the right that challenges the patriotism of others, but rather the left.  But what's more disturbing is the cavalier attitutde which they levy the charge.  Apparently calling someone unAmerican is so much a part of her everyday speech that it doesn't stick in Teresa's mind that she utters it.  That's kinda creepy.
