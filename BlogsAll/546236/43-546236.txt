Last paragraph of Howard's brief   War in European History :   One may feel some gratification that, after a thousand years of armed conflict within Europe, a society has developed which feels itself sufficiently secure to turn its back on the traditional military virtues; but this must be tempered by apprehension that, in a world so heterogeneous and unpredictable as that in which we live, such confidence may prove premature.  Nothing has occurred since 1945 to indicate that war, or the threat of it, could not still be an effective instrument of state policy.  Against peoples who were not prepared to defend themselves it might be very effective indeed.   Quick review of the book, I enjoyed it. It was basically a quick little overview of the development of war across the pond from feudal lords and their knights to mercenaries to princelings to merchants to "nations" to technologists to the nuclear age.  Sometimes new technology and weaponry change the face of warfare--sometimes the fighting spirit of a people is sufficient.  Howard writes that it's something of a give and take.  In particular, he notes that Europe has gone from the more limited warfare of maneuver to the all out frontal charges of Napoleonic wars to the relative piece and smallish wars until the total wars of WWI and WWII--and he argues that in the nuclear age, it's back to a more limited type of conflict since the whole of the populace isn't as invested in the war effort as was Napoleonic France or the Allies/Axis of WWII--and it's that sort of "specialization" and ultimate lack of overt conflict that was leading (and IMO, has led) Europe to its approach towards military matters today.
