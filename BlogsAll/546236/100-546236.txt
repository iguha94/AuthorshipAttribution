NYT--  New Qaeda Activity Is Said to Be Major Factor in Alert .    Senior government officials said Tuesday that new intelligence pointing to a current threat of a terrorist attack on financial targets in New York and possibly in Washington - not just information about surveillance on specific buildings over the years - was a major factor in the decision over the weekend to raise the terrorism alert level.   The officials said the separate stream of intelligence, which they had not previously disclosed, reached the White House only late last week and was part of a flow that the officials said had prompted them to act urgently in the last few days.  The officials disclosed the information a day after the Bush administration acknowledged for the first time that much of the surveillance activity cited last weekend by Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge to justify the latest, specific warnings had been at least three years old. At the same time, the White House offered a vigorous defense of its decision to heighten the alert in Manhattan, Newark and Washington, with officials saying there was still good reason for alarm.  But lest the Administration escape the "damned if you do, damned if you don't" mentality of the press, we get this:   Among other things, one official disclosed on Tuesday that one intelligence report had pointed to a possible attack "in August or September.''  That shifting tone may prove frustrating to the public, providing little guidance for assessing the gravity of threat information whose details remain shrouded in intelligence reports not available to anyone outside the highest ranks of the government.  I suggest that Homeland Security just change its   homepage  to say nothing but "Shit B Comin', Yo."  Doubts about specificity? Hey, they told you Shit B Comin',  doubts about the veracity of the alert? Hey, it wasn't just Shit B Comin', it was Shit B Comin', YO.  It's a win-win.
