What happens when you ask several non-American sports "experts" if Lance Armstrong's soon to be sixth straight Tour victory is   one of the greatest achievements in the history of sport ?  Some really curious answers. Must be a geographical thing.  Ok, so in weighing Lance's achievements, he must contend with the likes of:  BRIAN LARA'S 400  The greatest sporting achievement I have witnessed would definitely be the 400 not out scored by Brian Lara in Antigua during England's tour there in the winter. Lara was a previous record holder of the highest test score with 375 against England in 1994, which was beaten by Matthew Hayden last year. The first innings of 375 was again in Antigua and I was on the opposing side.  What is phenomenal about the 400 is that a batsman has the determination and concentration to break the record twice. It requires two solid days at the crease and there must be the huge temptation to try and do it all a bit quicker than the last time, at which stage you'll make a mistake.  Brian Lara is such a special player because he has the eye for the ball and the flair as well as powers of concentration. You can't really match what he has achieved in cricket, although in bowling terms I guess that Jim Laker's 19 wickets in the Test match against Australia at Old Trafford in 1956 comes very close.  I don't even know what these words MEAN.  Though, to be fair, the article does include more recognizeable names like Ali (for his comeback) and Pele (for playing lots of soccer I guess).  Then there's something about Bob Champion...who was apparently a very good "jump jockey."
