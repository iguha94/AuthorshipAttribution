Sometimes irony can be pretty darn ironic.  This is especially true as one reads this NYT story on how   utterly nasty San Francisco's United Nations Promenade has become .  A report on United Nations Plaza to the county board of supervisors last year listed a litany of woes, including human waste on the plaza, gang activity and drug sales, that discouraged people from visiting the area. Riders of the regional subway system, Bay Area Rapid Transit, even avoided walking through the plaza to reach the Civic Center station, the report said. *** Instead, beyond the intersection at Fifth Street, the street turns into a seedy mix of sex shops and vacant storefronts, where it is not uncommon to find mentally ill or drunken people carrying on conversations with themselves or stumbling bleary-eyed across the sidewalk. Mr. Halprin, who has worked on plans over the years to revitalize Market Street, said no one had come up with a good explanation for the street's stubborn resistance to greatness.  That this has happened in hyper-tolerant San Francisco makes it all the sweeter.  Of course, some might question the priorities of some of Frisco's residents:   "The U.N. needs strengthening all around the block, as far as I am concerned," said Mr. Halprin, who is 88. "The first thing is to get the hell out of Iraq. The second thing to do is this."  But in the meantime, I shall chuckle heartily and conclude that God does have a sense of humor.
