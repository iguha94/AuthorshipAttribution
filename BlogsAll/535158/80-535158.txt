          COLOMBIA'S IN ON THE GAME NOW  Colombia has requested to join consultations in the GMO dispute.  Their request is below.  So that brings the tally to the U.S., Canada, and Argentina now as complainants, with Peru and Colombia wishing to join consultations.  Looks like we may have the Americas against the EU on this one.   After the big announcement of who was on our side,   Egypt has backed out of the dispute .   This probably won't be a big deal for the dispute, it just leads me to realize that phone calls and deals are being made lining up parties on each side here - WTO members aren't getting involved or staying out of this dispute simply based on calm deliberation of what is legally correct.  And it seems that the dispute over GMOs has spread out of the Americas and Europe [and Egypt] to the Pacific Rim,   where Japan has irked the United States by asking for GMO labeling , apparently in an APEC meeting.  APEC member state scientists will apparently begin scientific research on GMOs.  To me, that's good.  The research may get some scientific answers to the GMO dispute that won't be considered suspect because they aren't being provided by the EU or the U.S.  Also in Asia, China   extended an interim rule"  requiring a lot of hoop-jumping to import GMO imports - how China ultimately decides on GMOs could have a big effect on  U.S. - China agricultural trade.  There is currently a $1 billion soybean trade between the U.S. and China.
