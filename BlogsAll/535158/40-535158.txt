             NORTH KOREANS SOUGHT HOSTAGES?  A senior defense official said the North Korean jets that intercepted a U.S. spy plane over the Sea of Japan (and painted it with radar, a threatening act) were   trying to get it to follow (presumably back to base) and kidnap its crew .  This of course evokes the Chinese interception of an American spy plane off Hainan Island and holding of its crew.  North Korea probably was inspired by that course of events.  Kim Jong Il probably thought a hostage-taking would lead to negotiation with the United States as it did with China.  Everyone says North Korea is trying to get attention.  Why?  Because it sucks there.  But this latest event proves that attention is not all that North Korea wants.  Kim Jong Il wants   hostages  .  He already has South Korea hostage because Seoul is so close to the DMZ and now wants Japan and the United States to be its hostages as well.  North Korea is a thug state - it cannot support itself so must either beg or steal.  Its leaders' egotism leads it to try to commit armed robbery writ large.  Its threats regarding its nuclear program (which is internal, not a direct threat to its neighbors) have not obtained satisfactory results, so now it wants to hold the United States hostage in a more direct manner.  I'm kind of glad Bush isn't dealing with North Korea first.  This will make North Korea's leaders feel like the second-rate thugs that they are.  Next, once Saddam is taken out, North Korea will be the one true threat out there (despite the "axis of evil" rhetoric, Iran   cannot   be dealt with like Iraq).  The U.S. may have a way to take out the North Korean military before they are able to destroy Seoul or use their nuclear weapons.  But I bet there are ways to put force the implosion of the North Korean regime without a direct attack, and if North Korea is the main security focus, the Bush Administration may just be able to make that happen.
