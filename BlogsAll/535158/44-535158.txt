            WHERE'S MY COFFEE?  This is what Khalid Shaikh Mohammed looked like when he was arrested in Rawalpindi, Pakistan Saturday night.  The hair is bad, but the guy has enough hair on his chest, back and shoulders to make   Alf  jealous.    According to U.S. counterterrorism sources , he was planning an attack at the time.  The other interesting thing is that he was found with computers, disks, cell phones and documents, which hopefully will lead   somewhere .  Stories now say that Mohammed is being interrogated by U.S., um ... interrogators in a undisclosed location.  They also say that one of his associates was a Somali, and the other, Pakistani Ahmed Abdul Qadoos, was actually so mentally incapable he could not finish junior high school.  I could imagine their misadventures and hi-jinks they must have had.  It sounds like a low-budget rip-off of   O Brother, Where Art Thou?     This article  reminds readers that in addition to Mr. Mohammed, terrorist masterminds Abu Zubaydah and Ramzi Binalshibh are also being held in undisclosed locations abroad.  Maybe Diego Garcia?  Not like they would ever know, even if they were in the same cell block.  But I can just imagine these three devious Islamic terrorists escaping their cells, taking over the island and threatening the world, like the evil bad guys from a James Bond (or Austin Powers) movie.
