            CHUKARS UP, MICRORAPTORS DOWN  Ever since I was a little kid, I've loved dinosaurs.  So, I've been intrigued with   recently published reports  about a small dinosaur discovered by Chinese scientists to have had feathers all over its body, looking something akin to a cross between a flying squirrel, a bird, and a lizard.  The critter's fantastic appearance wasn't what most interested me, it was the schism between scientists over whether birds first began flying by running up the sides of trees or floating from their upper branches.   Only last week,   Kenneth Dial  of the   University of Montana  published   an article  published an article in   Science , based on observations of   chukar partridge  chicks, which suppported the "bottom-up" faction.  Dial had found that the chicks used their wings to run up 50-degree inclines, leading to the inference that wings are an evolutionary advantages for climbing.  But this paleontogical find, if understood properly, shows that at least some proto-avians used their wings and feathers to glide. So, what conclusions can be drawn from all the evidence?  To a layman, the recent evidence doesn't seem entirely contradictory.  Wings could have initially evolved as a way for climbing to become possible.  Running in and out of trees, those early wings could have later evolved into modern wings as proto-birds jumped out of trees and began to glide.  Eventually, we may know.  But as for now, neither side seems to have won.
