          Things I want to do, now that I've finished with the bar exam:   Read the   James M. Cain book  Barnes & Noble delivered just before the exam to tempt me, which includes:   The Postman Always Rings Twice Double Indemnity Mildred Pierce  (the movie version of which I happened across one late night on PBS) and several shorter stories, including:   Pastorale The Baby in the Ice Box Dead Man Brush Fire  and  The Girl in the Storm      Rent and watch   My Cousin Vinny , which I've never seen, and whatever new movies strike my fancy.  Maybe   Seabiscuit  or   28 Days Later  if I can bring myself to go.   Update myself on the GMO dispute between the U.S. and EU -  I lost track somewhere after the Europeans passed new regulations removing the moratorium at the heart of the dispute.   Hit the mountains - I'd like to hike, if I could get home to the mountains somehow.   Play soccer.   Run.    Drink, socialize, and  just relax . Of course, the one thing I've learned in what little growing up I've done is that obligations never cease, though wonders really don't come along all that often.   I have to take the MPRE next Friday, and I have to start pounding the pavement to get a job as soon as possible . . . .  . . which, of course, is necessary to get the new apartment, car and everything else I've been itching for. And -  oh yeah -  that'll allow me to stop staring at my feet whenever somebody asks me, "what do you do?"  Well, the job search can wait for tomorrow, it's time for bed.
