            ROADMAP FOR PEACE, LAST STEP FOR WAR If Palestinians appoint "real" P.M., Bush will give Middle East "roadmap"  President Bush just announced on live television from the Rose Garden that if the Palestinian Authority appoints a prime minister with real authority, the Administration will release a roadmap for peace for the region.  Bush said Israel has to get settlers out of the occupied territories, but the Palestinians must halt terror.  The announcement is not seen as putting affirmative obligations on the Israeli side.    Here are more details , though there aren't many yet: this was just on TV.  I think President Bush has now finished off the last item on its checklist, essentially admitting that the item immediately precedent on the list - a second UN resolution - is unattainable as he prepares for this weekend's summit with British Prime Minister Blair and Spanish Prime Minister Aznar.  As the March 17 "deadline" approaches I think the Administration and "coalition" will probably admit that and take further steps toward war.  This was supposedly something Powell pushed for, and it will be seen as an olive branch to Arabs, many of whom are pro-democracy and question why the Bush Administration doesn't care much about the big problem of the region: the Israeli-Arab conflict.  Now, it appears, we are ready for war.   UPDATE :   According to newer articles , President Bush apparently spoke with King Abdullah of Jordan and Hosni Mubarak before his announcement.  Here is    the text of President Bush's statement , and   here is the video .
