           U.S. TO FILE WTO COMPLAINT AGAINST EU GMO MORATORIUM  The U.S. finally decided to bring this dispute to the WTO, along with Canada, Argentina and Egypt.  Third parties on the U.S. side will include Australia, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru and Uruguay.  This is a big case, but not as big as it could be apparently.  I read   USTR's press release  on the dispute and it seemed very careful not to mention a number of pieces of EC legislation that make it more difficult for American, Canadian, and other GMO producers to get their products to market, such as Directive 2001/18, that create labeling and traceability requirements, which are very expensive and difficult to comply with.  The U.S. appears to be acting very carefully to challenge nothing more than the EC's de facto moratorium on GMO imports -  maybe because it is not necessarily clear that the U.S. would win on the other issues.  However, the EC, in its   press release , seems to be defending based on the effectiveness of its approval process, so a large part of the EC's GMO mess really could get dragged in front of a Panel, in particular 2001/18.  If all the relevant issues were brought before a Panel, this could be the case that really defines the SPS Agreement, because this isn't just about an import ban like  EC - Hormones ,  Australia - Salmon , and  Japan - Varietals  were.  There are big issues like the trade-restrictiveness of the EC's GMO approval process and the relationship between the SPS and outside agreements like the Biosafety Protocol.
