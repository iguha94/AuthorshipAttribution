            CAREFUL BALANCING ACT IN IRAQ  President Bush said today that to avoid war, Iraq would not only have to disarm - Saddam Hussein must also be deposed.  I've noticed over time that there are a number of careful balances, or less artfully put, contradictions, the Bush Administration has to deal with in its Iraq policymaking:  Saddam Hussein must be deposed,  BUT  before that, he must get rid of his weapons of mass destruction.   The Bush Administration is encouraging Saddam's generals to depose him,  BUT  It promises to transition to democracy  AND  To prosecute hard-core associates of Saddam for war crimes or crimes against humanity.   The Administration wants help from Iraqi Kurds, so it has essentially ensured their freedom from oppression within a liberated Iraq  BUT  The Administration wants Turkish help, so it has to allow Turkish troops to enter the Kurdish parts of Iraq - would Turkey occupy the area or attempt to capture its Kurdish enemies living in the  de facto  independent Kurdish areas?   The U.S., whether using the UN formally or not, must clear the way for war before it acts,  BUT  It has to do this before the end of March, or it likely won't be able to fight Saddam until the fall (due to stifling summer heat).   The Administration wants international support and to work with its allies,  BUT  not to change, or appear to change, any of its behavior based on the opinions of other nations' leaders.   The UN must strengthen itself and prove its relevance,  BUT   To prove its relevance, the UN must allow the United States to act as if it were entirely irrelevant.  More to follow as I think of them.
