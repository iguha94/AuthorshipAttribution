            INCREASED THREAT LEVELS - CONDITION: TAUPE  I just heard that the threat level in the U.S. was increased from yellow to orange.  Living in Washington, D.C., you feel like there is always a potential terrorist threat.  If somebody was going to attack the U.S., the big targets are probably New York, D.C., and maybe some other location with high symbolic value or weak security.  So a raising of the security level only prompts you to say, "so what?"  My mind keeps going back to Darrell Hammond on Saturday Night Live as Tom Ridge - "I am immediately placing the country on condition taupe" (or whatever he said).    It's like saying "it's dangerous in D.C."  "OK," I say in response.  No,  really  dangerous.  OK, I say again.  No,  really, really  dangerous.  All right, I get the point, I say.  What does  really, really  dangerous mean as opposed to really dangerous?    Without specifics, the threat conditions are just a way for politicians to cover their asses in case something does go wrong.  Ashcroft and Ridge are thinking, what would people say if I had information about a threat that turns into a real terrorist attack, but didn't tell anyone about it?  While that is an unenviable position, unless warnings can give you information to make you change your behavior, all they cause is consternation.
