          THE BIG QUESTION: RESPONSIBILITY   The UN Headquarters building bombing in Iraq.  I first wanted to jump and say that this terrorist act was the action of international terrorists,  i.e.,  Al Qaeda.  But then I thought again.  It could be Baathists, angry Sunnis, it could be Shiites, a resurgent Ansar al Islam . . . the list goes on.    Juan Cole discusses who might be behind the bombing .  The bombing was, according to witnesses, the work of a suicide bomber.  Would that indicate international terrorist connections?  That might seem reasonable, but then you remember Saddam's Fedayeen, who recklessly went to attack American soldiers as they pushed through towns on their way to Baghdad and were slaughtered.    Could this bombing be the responsibility of the same bombers who attacked the Jordanian embassy?  The Jordanian embassy bombing puzzled some, as would a UN bombing.  I would be seriously concerned if the different attacks in the past several days in Iraq could be linked.  A number of soft targets have been attacked. A water main, an oil pipeline too long to guard, the Jordanian embassy, the UN building here . . .   Was the   attack in Israel  coordinated with the bombing in Iraq?  It appears not; that bombing was claimed by Islamic Jihad as a response to Israel's killing of a senior Islamic Jihad operative.  So at least this isn't a signature "multiple bombing" by Al Qaeda.
