          THE IRANIAN CONNECTION  The big story of the day seems to be the cutting of diplomatic ties and changes in strategy toward Iran.  The U.S. is planning on destabilizing the country and foment unrest to overthrow the country.  This is a bad move.  It will help entrench conservative forces there and undermine those who would reach out to us.  Now I can understand cutting diplomatic ties, the attacks were egregious.  But the real issue is what to do to weaken the hard-liners who harbor and support Al Qaeda.  The big-picture answer, unfortunately for the impatient Bushies, is still the Cuban answer: engagement with liberals and forcing the hardliners into irrelevance.  But, short-term, I wouldn't be against a few quiet assassinations of bad guys who are supporting terror and Al Qaeda operatives.  Enough to deter the bad guys and make them feel unsafe doing what they're doing.  But you're dreaming if you think we're going to be able to start a rebellion in Iran or improve the situation by invading the country.  What I wonder is whether the Bush guys are trying to prove that their cockamamy Axis of Evil strategy is right by changing the facts on the ground - if we take out the bad guys in charge in Iraq and Iran and run those countries, Bush guys will be able to say, "we acted when we saw a threat and we're better off safe than sorry."  Nobody will be able to say hostile engagement was a bad idea, they'll just be "speculating" the Bush people will say.  And we'll never learn if there was an alternative to the neo-con approach.
