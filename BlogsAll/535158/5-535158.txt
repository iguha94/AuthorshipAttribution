         Hey, so I'm back after a lengthy absence.     PRESIDENT BUSH'S MALPRACTICE DAMAGE CAP  Watching the news tonight, I saw a story about how President Bush wants to cap malpractice awards at $250,000.  Everybody's watching the insurance companies, trial lawyers, doctors, and patient advocates point fingers at each other, but nobody's surprised that President Bush would be interested in tort reform.  He's been interested in that at least since he was governor of Texas.  Maybe ever since he was rejected by the University of Texas Law School...but I digress.  What interested me about the malpractice damage cap was the timing.   Taking on Edwards   President Bush announced the cap on damages just a few weeks after Bill Frist -   "the Senate's only doctor"  - improbably succeeded Trent Lott as Majority Leader.  It's also only a few days after John Edwards announced he would run for president in 2004.  What's the one-term senator's background?  Oh, that's right, he's a rich trial lawyer, and every story about him seems to mention it.  I think President Bush sees Edwards as the prime candidate against him and is working with Frist to tar Edwards as a greedy lawyer, part of "what's wrong with America," while he's on the side of doctors and medical care for reg'lar folks.    I guess we'll just have to wait and see if my theory pans out.
