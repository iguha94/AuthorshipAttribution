            ATTACK ON ANSAR BEGINS  Kurdish troops and American Special Forces   launched the major attack  on Ansar al-Islam everyone had been waiting for at dawn today.  Nearly 5,000 Kurdish troops had been mobilized to make the attack on the group, estimated to have several hundred fighters.  They attacked from several directions while American special forces directed mortar fire from snowy hilltops and called in air strikes from circling planes.  Within several hours they had captured the Kurdish base at Biara as well as the towns of   Khurmal, Sargat, Ahmadabad and the other villages in the region .  The few remaining fighters made a run for the Iranian border and a local commander said the area should be mopped up within 24 hours.  Information regarding the attack supposedly came from   reporters embedded with the 1,000 Americans  who recently parachuted into Iraq, so it seems those forces were involved as well.  The U.S. and the Kurds attacked Ansar to be rid of a terrorist irritant and because of alleged ties to Al Qaeda.  Those ties seemed more reasonable after the suicide bomber in last week's car bomb attack that killed a photographer was revealed to be a Saudi,   Abdal Aziz bin Saud al Gharbi .  This seems to indicate that the organization wasn't strictly a homegrown group of   Iraqi Kurds who had fought in Afghanistan with the Taliban or Al Qaeda , there was at least some  international  component to Ansar al-Islam.   UPDATE:  See the New York Times' story for   more details .
