           ECONOMISTS ON THE TAX CUT  I didn't analyze the tax-cut-as-stimulus idea the same way the economists did, but it seems   I did catch the major logical flaw  in President Bush's argument, which ended up in the   Washington Post : Some members of Congress support tax relief but say my proposal is too big," Bush said in his Saturday radio address. "Since they already agree that tax relief creates jobs, it doesn't make sense to provide less tax relief and, therefore, create fewer jobs."   But few economists would argue that tax policy is so straightforward. Taken to its extreme, Joel Slemrod  [pictured above] , a tax economist at the University of Michigan, said that Bush's argument would support eliminating taxes altogether for the sake of job creation.   "Logically, the statement that more tax cuts are better is certainly wrong," Slemrod said. The economics seem to indicate that the economic state of the country is not just a question of how much money is put into the economy, because over the course of the Bush Administration losses have been exceeded by recent tax cuts and huge spending.  In the long run (say, 4 years from now),   the article  also said, the Bush Administration tax cuts would raise interest rates and lower savings rates and, due to higher return for investment income, there would be less jobs created.
