          THE 25TH HOUR   I saw Spike Lee's 25th Hour tonight at Union Station on the recommendation of my girlfriend.  I really liked two sequences in the movie.  First, the scene in the bathroom where, looking into the mirror,   Ed Norton 's character Monty Brogan has a dialogue with himself about all the things he hates about New York.  These are, of course, the things he really loves and Monty really only hates himself for having wasted his obvious potential.  The sequence starts with Monty noticing the words "fuck you" markered on the mirror in the bathroom, which reminds me of Holden finding "fuck you" written on the wall of the museum in    "Catcher in the Rye"  , and ends with Monty frustratedly trying to rub the writing off the mirror.  Of course Monty can't, just as he can't take back all the things that led him to get 7 years of jail time.  I also liked the fantasy sequence   Brian Cox  narrates near the end.  In it, Cox, who plays Monty's father, helps Norton escape to some western desert town instead of taking him to prison.  Monty gets a job, changes his name, eventually gets his girlfriend to move out there, has a family, and when he's really old, tells his family the real story.    Other than that, the movie is interesting, but doesn't really have much of a plot.  There are good characterizations by   Philip Seymour Hoffman  and   Barry Pepper .
