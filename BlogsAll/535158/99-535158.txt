          IT ALL GOES BACK TO LIBYA   Today's story: Libya will finally admit what has long been known: that   it was behind the bombing of Pan Am 103 , the flight that crashed into Lockerbie, Scotland.  Apparently a deal will soon be reached to resolve the long-running dispute over this claim.  Though Qaddafi seems to have changed his ways somewhat more recently, Libya back in the day was certainly a state sponsor of international instability.  Consider   this story  in the  Washington Post , which details the connections that Charles Taylor was able to make, using which he may still be able to influence Liberian and regional politics.  How were these connections made?  In rebel training camps in Libya.    You see, this is what happens when you allow states to sponsor terrorism and foreign freedom fighters.  It allows these states to foment instability and extend influence without needing military reach into areas where the trained rebels fight.  That's why we have to take out groups like the Taliban.  Iran might seem like another good candidate, but nobody seems to be able to take out the conservative clerics in Iran without destroying the rest of Iranian society.  Sgt. Stryker   has a post detailing  why Iraq under Saddam was a state sponsor of terrorism, mostly taken from an Administration list of reasons.  I don't buy some of these, some aren't directly terrorism related, and I would like a lot more information on others.  I trusted the Administration once, on WMD, I wouldn't want to burned again if I agree with them that Saddam sponsored terrorism to the extent outlined in the Sgt. Stryker post.
