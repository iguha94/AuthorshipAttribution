            BUDGET CHICANERY  Switching back to the home front for a moment, in Washington, the President presented Congress with a   supplemental request for $74.7 billion  to support the war effort in Iraq.  But   only last week  the President asked Congress to vote on a budget   which included large tax cuts , while denying that estimates of war costs could be made so these costs could be offset.  President Bush isn't lying, it is hard to estimate war costs.  But he could have waited to have a vote on the budget until war costs were clearer - say, another week?  If Congress had to balance tax cuts and war spending at the same time, tax cuts would likely lose - or at least have to be scaled back.  By bringing up the two issues at different times, the Bush Administration is setting foreign policy goals and asking for spending necessary to meet those goals, then not forcing Congress and the public to consider how to pay for it.   As much as I think we should promote American interests abroad, it is wrong to tell someone to go spend money you know they will have to give you back next week.  Go ahead, blame Democrats for overtaxing and overspending on domestic priorities.  But don't pretend forcing Congress to decide on big tax cuts when war-related costs are just over the horizon is any better.
