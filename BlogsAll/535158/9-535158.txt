            TIME FOR THE WMD "LOCKBOX?"  Saddam Hussein   supposedly has told  CBS's   Dan Rather  he wants to have a live televised debate with President Bush.  I can see it now.  Jim Lehrer moderating live at the United Nations with Bush on the left and Saddam at his right.  "Saddam, please allow President Bush to finish..."  Whether Rather has the story correct or not remains to be seen.  You may remember that Rather mis-called Florida for Gore on Election Night 2000.  (You may also remember that, in reflecting on this mistake, he said that, "we've lived by the crystal ball and learned to eat so much broken glass tonight that we're in critical condition.")  Well, even if Rather is reporting it correctly, President Bush's spokesman Ari Fleischer has rejected debate, saying this is   "not a serious statement."   It's too bad.  [UPDATE]  Fleischer also said,   a la Mystery Science Theater 3000  that he wanted to insert himself in the middle of Rather's Saddam interview with comments from the Bush Administration.  Almost as odd as Dan Rather eating broken glass.  But cheer up, all of you who were already hoping for a knock-down drag-out live Iraq debate.  I know somebody who'd be up for the challenge!  Captain Lockbox himself,   Al Gore .  Maybe the guy who said "I will fight for you!" should take Saddam to the rhetorical mat.  "You know, Saddam, I have a  plan  for your weapons of mass destruction, your long-range Al-Samoud missiles.  I, Al Gore, promise to put them in a  "lock-box"  where no one can get them."  Sounds like a good idea to me.
