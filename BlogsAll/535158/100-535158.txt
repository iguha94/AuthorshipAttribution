          MORE ON CAIN: JAMES M. CAIN AND  THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE    I saw    The Man Who Wasn't There   a few years ago and enjoyed it.  Since then, I've read a number of noir stories, including some by Raymond Chandler and most recently James M. Cain.  Now I realize that  The Man Who Wasn't There  was a tribute to Cain.  It took elements straight out of different Cain novels.  One such element was the scene in  Mildred Pierce  in which Billy Bob Thornton takes a girl he thinks has musical talent to a foreign music teacher, who says she is terrible.  The movie has an ending similar to that in  Double Indemnity , in both the novel turns out to have been the confession of a man who had been tricked and couldn't get away with murder.  The very notion of the man who wasn't there, a sort of non-descript protagonist who isn't really in charge of his own destiny, who commits crimes that seem to him perfect but are easy to unravel, is a Cain archetype, though Thornton's character at least worked in a barber shop rather than a gasoline station/garage/eatery.  Basically, I have one more reason to love the Coen brothers.    By the way, I saw a trailer for    Intolerable Cruelty   before  Seabiscuit  yesterday - it looks like Joel and Ethan Coen took on the romantic comedy genre this time, and from the trailer the movie seems better than most romantic comedies.  If you need a date movie in October, this is probably a good bet.    Oh, and Billy Bob Thornton is in this one too.
