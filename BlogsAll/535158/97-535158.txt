          VICTOR BOUT   I just saw an interesting Ted Koppel    Nightline   interview with two experts on arms dealing, in light of the recent   FBI missile sting .  They both talked about   Victor Bout , a   former Soviet Air Force and KGB Officer  who has sold and   ferried  arms   all over the world  (both legally and in violation of sanctions, apparently) Bout has sold arms to both the Northern Alliance and Al Qaeda.  He has remained unpunished because he has been protected by political connections, at first   in the United Arab Emirates , recently in   Russia , and now in Ukraine.    By comparison, who did we pick up in this recent sting?  This guy sounds like a small fry who was helped in this sale by the FBI, he doesn't seem like somebody who'd be otherwise able to buy and sell weapons.  Forget this guy.  Lock him up, of course, but go after the big guys like Victor Bout whose arms sales actually matter in the war on terrorism.   UPDATE : The latest  New York Times Magazine  apparently has a profile of Victor Bout, though it   isn't online yet .  There's also a  Financial Times  article saying the latest arrest indicates greater Russian cooperation on arms dealing.  I wonder if that new cooperation could reach out and get Victor Bout.  The speakers on  Nightline  didn't trust Leonid Kuchma to cooperate on arms trading issues, and that's a big moneymaker in Ukraine.  So I doubt even greater cooperation with Russia will lead to the arrest of the most notorious Russian arms dealer.   UPDATE II : The    New York Times Magazine  article ,  Arms and the Man  is now up.  It's a great story.  Shady arms dealings that seem impossible without government support, mafia enclaves, friendships with dictators, and Victor Bout is just the tip of the iceberg.  Reading this, I actually felt afraid for Peter Landesman, the reporter who wrote this story.
