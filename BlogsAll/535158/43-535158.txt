            IS MOHAMMED AT BAGRAM AIR BASE?  It appears I'm wrong about Mohammed being on Diego Garcia.  Pakistan's Information Minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed,   said Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is still in the region  (that is, near Pakistan) and "Most probably he is in Afghanistan."  Reporters have asked whether the U.S. is holding Mohammed at   Bagram Air Base , its headquarters in Afghanistan, and got a standard "we don't give out that kind of information" denial.  It was noted that Bagram Air Base is where some prisoners were held before being transported to the U.S. Navy facility at Guantanamo Bay.  Bagram Air Base does have an interrogation center, and reputedly there has been some   less than humane treatment  there.    That makes me think White House Spokesman Ari Fleischer's statements yesterday that   Mohammed was being treated humanely  may actually be an oblique reference to Bagram Air Base.  Fleischer may have simply wanted to clarify that in its efforts to extract information from Mohammed, the U.S. is treating him according to international laws and norms (so U.S. soldiers won't be tortured if captured in Iraq?) OR .....[DUM DAH  DUMM! ] Fleischer may have been trying to head off a line of questioning about Mohammed's treatment based on what he believed the press may soon discover, that Mohammed is being held at Bagram Air Base.  Oh, and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's Al Qaeda co-conspirator, who has been previously identified as an   Egyptian and later as a Somali , is now thought to be a Saudi named Mustafa Ahmed al-Hasawi, an Al Qaeda paymaster with ties to Mohammed Atta and the September 11
