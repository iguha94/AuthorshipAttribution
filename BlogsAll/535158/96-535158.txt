          POWER OUTAGES and T*****ISM   Everyone is being careful not to mention the T-word in association with the power outages, but I'd bet this event has sparked terrorists' imaginations.  The  Washington Post    is saying that :  "the problem was caused by an outage at a Manhattan power plant that destabilized the power grid about 4 p.m." The  New York Times    is saying that :  "the trouble started with a fire at an upstate power plant . . . [b]ut there were conflicting reports about whether the plant is in the region of the Central Hudson utility or in Niagara Mohawk's territory. If all it takes to cause this kind of massive, cascading power failure is a fire in an upstate power plant, why wouldn't terrorists try to set one?  You have to wonder what the result of this blackout will be for electricity deregulation.  Major power sharing and regional interdependence in power grids is probably at least a partial cause of the power failure - will Congress want to take steps to limit power sharing, or will this problem just be forgotten?    Maybe I'm being too cynical, but I don't think there will be a major policy response to this disaster  because there appear to have been no deaths and no one is panicking , especially in New York City, site of the 9/11 attacks.  No hospital closures, no deaths I've heard of, nothing but people being forced to walk home.  I think we'll be just as vulnerable to this sort of power failure, whether accidentally or intentionally caused, 5 years from now.
