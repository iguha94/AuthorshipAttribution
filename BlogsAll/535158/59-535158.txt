           JOY AND PAIN  I haven't been able to post that much this week.  I've been trying to write  two  briefs for a WTO Moot Court competition I probably never should have gotten mixed up in.  I spent a period from 6:45am Tuesday until 2:00pm or so Thursday awake, most of the time working on these briefs.  In the end we turned in our briefs late, losing points and probably hurting our chances immensely.  We compete on April 14th.  Being done with the brief was a great load off my chest; despite the imperfections and lateness of our brief, I was happy to have worked hard at this and done the best I could.  The weather here has turned to Spring; the day I turned in the brief I walked home up the hill from Georgetown's main campus having not slept for 54 hours or so.  The magnolias and cherry trees are all blooming, everyone's flower gardens are full of color, a nice breeze was blowing.  I realized that with the pain of life comes a great amount of happiness.  My girlfriend came in later that day and I was able to spend some time with her and some old friends Friday night.  I have more back work to do than I can believe, I'm still looking for a job, and I'm trying to spend the weekend with my girlfriend.  Joy and pain and joy again.
