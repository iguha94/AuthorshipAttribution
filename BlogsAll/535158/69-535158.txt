          I MISSED THE MATRIX PREMIERE!  Tried to go see   Matrix Reloaded  today.  Made the mistake of going to buy my ticket for a show at either  10:00, 10:30, 11:00, or 11:20pm  at 3:30 this afternoon.  Only 6 1 / 2  hours in advance - big mistake.  So I missed the show tonight.  Single tear sliding down my left cheek . . . .   Showtimes for tomorrow:  10:00pm, 10:30, 11:25, 12:35pm, 1:10, 1:45, 2:40, 3:15, 3:50, 4:25, 5:00, 5:55, 6:30, 7:05, 7:40, 9:10, 9:45, 10:20, 10:55pm  Hopefully I'll be able to get a ticket for one of those.  The worst part about not seeing it is that the world is awash in Matrix information.  Slate   has a review  full of spoilers, there are trailers all over the place,    Charlie Rose   had Joel Silver, Larry Fishburne (yes, I call him Larry), Carrie-Ann Moss, and his Keanu-ness on, giving away way too much about the movie.  Guess who said "it's all about a collective of shall I say it? . . .  love ?"  I had to change the channel.  Normal people may not need an excuse like the vacuity of Keanu Reeves to change the channel away from Charlie Rose, but I'm a PBS-aholic.  Can't get enough of the stuff.   Man I need cable . . . .
