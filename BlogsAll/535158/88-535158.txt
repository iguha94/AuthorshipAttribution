          MEARSHEIMER'S GLOOMY PREDICTION   Right now I'm reading John Mearsheimer's  The Tragedy of Great Power Politics  and was interested to see him in a  Newshour  interview last night along with Tom Friedman and Ralph Peters.  I don't agree with everything in  The Tragedy of Great Power Politics , but Mearsheimer is always a provocative guy.  I remember that he supported containment rather than invasion as the proper course for Iraq, but I didn't think his conclusions about American involvement in Iraq were so gloomy.  Here's how he ended the interview: Well, I think the idea that a great power like the United States is going to come across the Atlantic Ocean and invade and occupy and create an empire in the Middle East is again delusional.  The history of the 20th century is littered with fallen empires, the British Empire, the Dutch Empire, the French Empire, the Ottoman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian, the Russian Empire and even the early American empire.  One of the principal lessons we should have learned from the 20th century is that great powers cannot occupy and create empires in the Arab and Islamic world. And we made a huge mistake going in there earlier this year and there's no way we're going to get out without paying a god-awful price.  So, the big idea seems to be that we can't project American power that far away effectively and we're going to get stuck in a quagmire in Iraq.    Well, that's certainly provocative.  I'm not sure what I think of this position.  I'll update once I think about it some more.
