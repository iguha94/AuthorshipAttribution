               AMERICANS ADVANCE IN SOUTH, BRITS FIGHT URBAN BATTLES  Though there was bloody fighting yesterday, U.S. strategy in southern Iraq seems to be working as could be expected.    U.S. and British forces are advancing as fast as possible on Baghdad , fighting where they have to ( e.g.    An Nasiriya  and   Najaf ) and leapfrogging cities where they could be forced into difficult urban warfare ( e.g.  Basra).  They are leaving, therefore, areas behind them that do not require simply mopping-up actions in the normal sense.    Umm Qasr  is a good example; it was thought pacified until resistance showed up, and serious fighting resumed.  British troops are   slowly moving into Basra , where Iraqis have dug in in civilian areas.  It seems that the British have been conducting a lot of the urban warfare as the Americans move north.  I wonder if this is rooted in the legendary impatience and fickleness of the American public.  If Americans watching the news don't want to see American troops in difficult, bloody, house-to-house and hand-to-hand fighting, giving that job to the British (with their experience in Northern Ireland) does seem to solve a problem for American war planners.  They don't want the TV war to look like the Mogadishu of   Blackhawk Down .  This makes me wonder if the British public are any less averse to such images.
