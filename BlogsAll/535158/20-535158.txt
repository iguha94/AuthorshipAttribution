            PARATROOPERS LAND TO OPEN NORTHERN FRONT  According to Lt. Col. Thomas Collins, a spokesman for the U.S. Army's Southern European Task Force, nearly 1,000 Army paratroopers      from the 173rd Airborne Brigade jumped from 15 Air Force C-17 transports at midnight Thursday to take control of a runway near  Bashur  in Kurdish-held northern Iraq.  The troops, based in Vicenza, Italy flew directly from Aviano Air Base to open a new front in the war in Iraq.  They are in a prime location to influence events in both PUK- and KDP-held areas and the Turks waiting   just 30 miles to the north .  The troops, which include Army Rangers, landed in this fashion so that they could mass to protect themselves,   though they did not meet with hostile fire .  They were also protected by air cover from AC-130 gun ships.  The lightly armed force will be reinforced and receive heavier weapons,   including Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles    over the next several days  .    Commanders said that Special Forces soldiers being flown into the airport had to turn around last week because they   were being fired upon  and other Special Forces soldiers   had come under attack  in Irbil, about 35 miles away.  They are also supposedly   worried about Ansar al-Islam .  I  may have actually been right  in my last post!.  The U.S. is worried about protecting its troops in northern Iraq and probably attacked Ansar as a prelude to opening up large-scale operations on the northern front.  That is why   Kurdish officials have offered amnesties to the less hardcore members of that group and have arranged to have members of Komala, a similar but less dangerous group, leave their villages .  I amaze even myself sometimes.
