         I've been having trouble with my dialup connection to the Internet.  Instead of getting broadband like smart people with jobs, I've decided to get an RSS feed aggregator and go to my undergrad library where I can use  their  broadband connection.    But I didn't know what aggregator to get.  I first read about   AmphetaDesk , which sounds popular, but I couldn't get it to work right on my Windows ME machine.  So I looked around and found   NewsMonster , a Mozilla extension.  I'm a big fan of Mozilla (I use Firebird for browsing) so I thought it would work great.    Installation for Windows was OK, though I had problems because I was using a daily build of Mozilla and had to uninstall it and install 1.4.  For Linux, however, it was a disaster as I couldn't seem to get the Java settings right and  Newsmonster relies on Java to work.  Another Linux learning curve problem: I could probably figure out what prevents it from working, it'd just take the next two weeks.  So I set up Newsmonster in Windows.  I set it up to download about 100 RSS feeds, most of the blogs I read and other news sources.  That turned out to be a huge download, and worse, a big memory drain.  I pretty much had to start aggregation and forget about touching the machine.  I guess 256 MB of RAM isn't enough any more.  But once it was done, I could go home without needing the Internet for anything other than checking my email - so long as I could get by on the morning's information.  As I look through the feeds I've downloaded, I'm a bit disappointed by the amount of content I'm actually getting.  I don't want  Washington Post   headlines , I want  Washington Post   articles .  So I need to find more RSS feeds with "content" or "cache" or "toggle for more" rather than "permalink" (which pretty much defeats the point).
