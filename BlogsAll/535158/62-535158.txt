          BLAIR PLAYS THE RACE CARD  I remember Juan Williams getting rather angry on Fox News Sunday a few weeks ago about people who said the Jayson Blair story was about race.  He said those who did so were just trying to use the Blair story to push their ideological agendas.  That's true, I thought, there are a lot of cynical people out there who can't just see this as the story of a coked-out alcoholic manic-depressive liar who happened to self-destruct at the New York Times.  And who also happened to be black.  But no,   it seems the truly cynical manipulator in this tale is Jayson Blair himself .  He is planning a book entitled  Burning Down My Master's House , in which he paints himself as the black victim of white institutions from his second-grade teacher to the New York Times, a drug-runner from the streets whose lying and plagiarizing habits were his way of sticking it to the man.  Blair portrays himself this way despite growing up middle class; he grew up in Centreville, Virginia (the D.C. suburbs) and his father is now Inspector General of the Smithsonian Institution.  Something about Blair's account of himself just doesn't sit well with me.  It seems like he's still lying and making excuses for his actions rather than admitting his guilt and trying to make amends.  The fact that Blair doesn't accept primary blame for his failures makes me doubt his account more generally.    But I understand why Blair has to write this book and make his millions.  He'll never find another employer willing to put him in a position of trust.   . . . . At least for a while.  But this is America, the land of second chances.  And unfortunately this may not be the last we hear of Jayson Blair.
