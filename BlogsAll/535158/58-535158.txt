            PAGING MR. POWELL, PAGING MR. POWELL   "Paging Mr. Herman, paging Mr. Herman..." went the line in    Pee-Wee's Big Adventure  .  After all we've heard from Don Rumsfeld and   Paul Wolfowitz , you wonder where Powell's been exiled to.  Rumsfeld is talking about   threatening Iran, Syria  and others with Iraq's fate.  Wolfowitz is talking about how the U.S. is going to run the occupation of Iraq: not much more than 6 months of occupation.  With help from U.S. forces as initial governors, the Iraqi opposition would lead a transition away from Saddam's regime without any interference from the UN.  The neoconservatives are in charge and running things their way.  I don't see things turning out their way.  I think the U.S. will have to undertake a serious occupation of Iraq and won't be able to move on for several years.  The question used to be whether the U.S. could fight wars on two fronts at once.  I think there's a new question of a neoconservative era.  With the U.S. projecting its power all over the globe, how many places in the world can the U.S. keep the peace or build nations while maintaining a credible threat to attack the other bad guys.  If the U.S. military has to maintain homeland security, do peacekeeping in the Balkans, play federal marshal in Afghanistan, and create a believeable democracy in Iraq, can it believeably threaten everyone else?  And how long can the U.S. sustain the costs necessary to implement the neoconservative strategy?  I don't think any amount of time is really long enough; eventually those costs will be unsustainable and so will this kind of policy.  That's why we need Powell back in town.  We need somebody to counter the intemperate Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz the true believer.
