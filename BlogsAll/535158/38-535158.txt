            HOW DID ERDOGAN END UP IN OFFICE?  Recep Tayyip Erdogan, leader of Turkey's Justice and Development Party (a moderate Islamist party)   has been elected to Parliament  and will become Prime Minister.  Previously barred from office because he recited a well-known poem that "incited religious hatred," his party's majority in Parliament was able to amend the Constitution and allow him to come into office and go from simply being the power behind the throne to Prime Minister.    While stories say that this will give the U.S. another chance to base American forces in Turkey for a war on Iraq, my question is how the Turkey's supra-constitutional authority allowed this constitutional amendment and why they let Erdogan take office despite their opposition to Islamic parties and Islamist leaders.  Is it because Turkey's military thinks Erdogan will be able to get the people to go along with an invasion?  Is it because the military are afraid of a more Islamist party?  Is it because the mainstream parties have failed the Turkish people?  Maybe it's all of these things.  I just hope Erdogan does a good job.   More thoughts:  the Turkish military may want the chance to invade Kurdistan so bad that it's more willing to go along with a mildly Islamist government that will give it that chance.  Ordinary people don't want to invade Iraq, but the military wants to deal with Kurds it sees as terrorists.
