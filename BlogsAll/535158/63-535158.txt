          THE LESSON OF SARS: DON'T EAT WEIRD ANIMALS  Discovery of SARS in civet cats in Southern China indicates that   the disease probably spread to humans from those animals .  Or maybe racoon dogs or Chinese ferret badgers.  All very exotic animals, even in Southern China.  While I'll eat a lot of things others won't, I'm not sure I'd want to try any of those critters.  In my lazy rambling around the Internet I found an old BBC story about animals available as food in southern China [ cobras, turtles, dogs, civets, pangolins, owls . . .] and people's attitudes about eating them.    The article  says many think that:  "If it flies in the air or walks on the land then it must be good to eat." If there's any lesson that comes out of the SARS story as regards transmission of diseases from animals to humans, it is how  wrong  that old Chinese saying really is.  And the problem isn't just in the eating, it's in preparing animals as food and handling these animals while live.  Just having wild animals like these around is probably a bad idea.  Of course, ordinary super-domesticated animals  can  carry undiscovered diseases as well, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (Mad Cow Disease).  It just seems that normally, we understand diseases of domesticated animals better than those of wild animals and thus they are probably safer to eat.
