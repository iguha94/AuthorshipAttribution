              SARS MAY BE A CORONAVIRUS   Or a paramyxovirus, though scientists are moving away from that early theory.  Or a coronavirus that works in tandem with a paramyxovirus.   Or the paramyxovirus might just be something normally around this time of year unrelated to SARS.  Or a coronavirus may weaken the immune system, allowing the paramyxovirus to sicken or kill people. Scientists in labs from Hong Kong's Prince of Wales Hospital to the U.S. Department of Defense are trying to figure out what causes SARS, a surprisingly contagious and apparently new disease that is having a strong enough effect in Eastern Asia to significantly    harm the economy  .  Big surprise, this harms the tourism industry, but it has also forced Motorola to   idle a Singapore plant  and quarantine some workers.  People in tiny, crowded Hong Kong are trying   avoid areas with large numbers of people , which sounds pretty difficult.  If SARS turns out to be a coronavirus, it would be   one of the most powerful  members of a family better known for causing colds.  Because these viruses are generally not very harmful, there hasn't been much research as to what can counter the virus.  So even if they know what the disease is, there may not be an effective treatment.  Now this is probably starting to scare you, right?  It sure scares me.   But just to offer some perspective, check out the virus above.  That's   ebola  .  In an outbreak that I sure don't remember hearing or reading much about,    114 of the 128 patients infected in northwestern Congo   died  of the incurable disease over the last three months.
