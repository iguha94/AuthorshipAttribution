            GOODBYE, NEIGHBOR  I remember as a kid not liking Mr. Rogers.  I thought he was unbearably dorky - his simple and serene life on the show was harder to fathom than the "land of make-believe" he took kids to on a miniature red trolley.  When I was older, I remember telling my Mom that I had liked Sesame Street, but never liked Mr. Rogers.  She said, no, that I actually  had  liked Mr. Rogers when I was really little - in fact, I used to call him "neighbor."  As hard for me to believe as this may be, it's probably right.  I remember that when my girlfriend saw Mr. Rogers in the Sea-Tac airport I really wished I could have seen him too.  I have a sense that Mr. Rogers, in the words of Sandburg: ... was good to look at, smelled good, listened good. He threw out something fresh and beautiful from the skin of his body and the touch of his hands wherever he passed along. That quote is from the poem that inspired this weblog,  "To A Contemporary Bunkshooter,"  and the words were used to describe Jesus.  That Mr. Rogers (an ordained Presbyterian minister) would bring to mind descriptions of Jesus just shows how a good a person he was, and how he touched so many lives in a good way.  His death is sad and merits mention. To paraphrase his song, "he...was...special."
