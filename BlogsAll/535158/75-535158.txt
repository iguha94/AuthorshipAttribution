          IS THE "ROAD MAP" ALREADY DEAD?  The New York Times   sure seems to think so .  It is at least on pause while Powell goes to the region to try to set up some ad hoc reciprocal steps that can be taken.  What this article seems to make obvious is that the people with the ultimate veto on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process are the groups willing to launch terror attacks against Israel (Hamas, Al Aqsa Martyr Brigades, Islamic Jihad . . .).  If they disagree with whatever is going on, they just launch attacks, turning Israeli popular and political opinion against whatever peace options are set out and scuttling the peace process.  They won't stop attacking if Arafat or Abu Mazen ask them and would probably have to be taken out militarily, which doesn't seem possible even for Israel.  As I've written earlier, however, these parties seem like they will never accept a resolution that doesn't have them vanquishing the Israelis in some way.  That hard line position and the natural Israeli response seems to condemn the peace process to failure.  Maybe the road map is/was good in that it brought a relative moderate in Abu Mazen to the forefront to take over once Arafat dies, goes senile, or gives up the power ministries (the current division of ministries just leads to a weak Palestinian government, which terror groups probably love).  Maybe Abu Mazen can lead a trend toward moderation among Palestinians that will marginalize the ready-for-martyrdom groups.  But I agree with the  Times  that short-term prospects for peace are not great.
