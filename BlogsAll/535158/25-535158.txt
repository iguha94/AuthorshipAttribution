            IRAQI VIOLATIONS OF THE LAWS OF WAR?  In a briefing at CENTCOM today, Lt. Gen. John Abizaid said that Iraqis are violating the Geneva Convention.  Here's what the Iraqis are alleged to have done:  Iraqi forces are alleged to have   acted as if they were surrendering then to have opened fire with artillery on American soldiers  coming to accept their surrender.  This was said to have resulted in the deaths of approximately fifteen American soldiers.   Several soldiers supposedly made a wrong turn and were captured by Iraqi forces.  The Iraqis apparently videotaped these soldiers identifying themselves and their home states.  These images and then those of several bodies were then   shown on Iraqi state television  (the pictures above are supposedly from this videotape).  So the Iraqis humiliated, videotaped, and executed soldiers contrary to the Geneva Convention's Article 13.   American forces were also attacked by Iraqi forces out of uniform infiltrating into southern Iraq, supposedly   Saddam's Fedayeen  and Special Security Organization troops, who apparently welcomed Americans and then ambushed them.   And now there are indications that   twelve American soldiers have been captured by Iraqi irregulars .  President Bush has said that he   expects them to be treated humanely , but based on the way these others were treated, that unfortunately seems unlikely.  Iraq's Defense Minister Sultan Hashim Ahmed has said that   Iraq would not harm prisoners of war and would treat them in accordance with the Geneva Convention , but as the   Iraqi regime is starting to lose control , especially in the South, American soldiers are likely to be mistreated or killed if captured.
