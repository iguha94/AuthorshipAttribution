          NATO PLANS TO GET KARADZIC BY NEXT YEAR?  That's what   this  Reuters  article  seems to say.  The EU is hinting that it could take over the Bosnia peacekeeping mission from SFOR by next year.  Such a handover seems to amount to an American pullout from Bosnia.   While the American commander of SFOR, General William Ward, has said that he does not know if SFOR will be replaced next year, he says that there are tasks he wants to accomplish before NATO hands responsibility over to the EU, including the capture of Karadzic and Mladic.  These captures seem like a benchmark for accomplishment the U.S. can use to justify a pullout.   Based on troop needs in Afghanistan and especially Iraq and a U.S. presence in Kosovo, leaving Bosnia in the hands of the EU would probably benefit the U.S.  This could be a good route to some reconciliation on the military cooperation level because the EU's core states, France and Germany, aren't interested in helping the U.S. militarily in Iraq.  So I would bet the EC will take over after the U.S. and NATO capture Karadzic and maybe Mladic.    SFOR troops should have free access (though they'll face local opposition) to capture of Karadzic in Republika Srpska.  Karadzic would probably get more support in Srpska than in neighboring Montenegro (where he may also be hiding) but SFOR doesn't have a mandate to go into Montenegro . . . Or Serbia for that matter, where Mladic is supposed to be living.  So capture of these two probably won't just involve a military attack but a lot of difficult negotiating with Montenegro and Serbia.
