          CHEMICAL ALI CAPTURED     Remember this guy?   Remember how he was killed by U.S. bombing?  Well,  forget what you heard.    He's alive and has been captured .  Remember that other guy, oh, what's his name - Saddam?  Yeah, he wasn't killed by U.S. bombing either.  He's still out there, and as long as he isn't captured or dead people fear him.  All this reminds me again that no matter how much we wish for antiseptic war, American air power can't do everything we want it to.  Bomb a bunker to smithereens, we still don't know if the guy supposedly inside was killed.    We need soldiers on the ground, and   we might just get some peacekeeping troops from India, Pakistan and Turkey by going to the UN  Security Council and actually negotiating with others who may wish to commit troops.  Finally.  It's been a bit ironic up to this point: the Bush Administration is so insistent on having everything its way in Iraq that in fact we don't have enough troops to actually keep the country under our control.    If we aren't going to expand the U.S. military, we can't be successful alone.  I mean,   James Dobbins says  we need 300,000 to 500,000 troops, and there are only 161,000 soldiers there now.  How many are needed to do the job right?  I'm not sure, but almost everyone outside of the White House or DOD says "more than are there now."    I would support a long-term increase in numbers of soldiers to support U.S. missions in Afghanistan and Iraq, which I think will be long-term commitments for the United States.
