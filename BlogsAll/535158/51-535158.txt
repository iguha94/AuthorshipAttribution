            BAGHDAD'S WANNABE MAYOR ARRESTED    This guy  has been acting like the mayor of Baghdad for too long, pretending, or at least not discouraging rumors to the effect, that he was put in power by the Americans.  He was arming and uniforming his supporters.  People were re-registering for their jobs with him.  I'm glad the U.S.   finally arrested him  - apparently in the middle of a T.V. interview where he said he'd remain in power until a transititional government took over.  That was apparently too much.  His presumptuousness is of a kind with that of Ahmed Chalabi, the DOD's favorite returned Iraqi exile.  These guys will never be able to hold power and the fact that some in the U.S. support the Iraqi National Congress has unduly emboldened them to take things they do not deserve.  They are carpetbaggers, and hopefully this signals to Chalabi and the Iraqi people that the INC is  not  going to be put in charge by the United States.   WHAT TO DO ABOUT SHIITES?  Another thing I don't like are those who say that the Shiites' self-assertion in southern Iraq is a wonderful part of a new Iraqi religious and political pluralism.        That statement is not a lie, in itself.  But it is a dodge on the basic problem of what to do about that very large segment of Iraqi society who want a theocratic government.  They will not be able to get  that  exactly, but they may get something fundamentally less secular than what exists in many parts of the Arab world.  Najaf and Karbala are likely to be more like Teheran than Kuwait for a long time, and it's not clear how the U.S. will be able to temper the religious movements.  My thought is to try to take the best of what exists in Iran in order to prevent the worst of what exists in Iran.  Try to bring the clerics into a pluralistic political process without allowing them to  end  the political process.  How to do this: gerrymander Iraq by creating multi-member districts that allow moderates into power along with the Islamists.  Create districts and seats for tribal leaders to counteract the imams.  And show what cooperating with the United States can get them.  I would suggest a massive aid project for southern Iraq: recreate, as best as possible, the marsh ecosystem of Southern Iraq.  It will be ecologically friendly and employ southern Iraqis.  Just make sure we know who's in charge of the money so that it can't be siphoned off and given to the bad guys.   WHAT TO DO ABOUT NORTHERN IRAQ?  In contrast with southern Iraq, the problem is of  too little  ethnic/religious solidarity between peoples.        Turkish special forces are smuggling weapons in to Turkmen in Kirkuk, who it says are being abused by Arabs and Kurds.  I don't get exactly what relationship exists between Turkmen and Turks, but obviously it is closer than that between Turks and Kurds or Arabs.  The tone of   this article  seems to suggest that the Turks are really in Kirkuk to stir up trouble than actually protect anyone, but it's hard to know what the case really is sitting at a desk here in Washington, D.C.  Where conflict  does  seem apparent and ugly is in Mosul, the other major northern city of mixed ethnicity, where it seems the thugs, gangsters and ethnic fighters are hard to distinguish from one another.  This reminds me of Johnny Adair and the Ulster Freedom Fighters, who were mixed up in crime as well as sectarian fighting.  I wonder if the U.S. shouldn't let the British deal with this situation because of that experience.  The U.S. has had trouble in Mosul because of its sponsorship of the Kurds and Mosul's favoring of Saddam.  Whoever is in charge, Mosul seems likely to be a locus of conflict for a while to come.  The common problem in both northern and southern Iraq seems to be insufficient numbers of police and a power vacuum due to the lack of clarity about the political status in cities and in Iraq overall.  Increased American troops may be necessary to ameliorate the solution, but I wonder if they can actually solve all of these problems satisfactorily.
