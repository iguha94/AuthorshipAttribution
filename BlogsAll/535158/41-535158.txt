            BIN LADEN CORNERED? HIS SONS CAPTURED? RUMORS SWIRL    The Washington Post reports  that  Sardar Sanaullah Zehri, the home minister of Pakistan's Baluchistan province, says that a joint U.S.-Pakistani operation to take out Al Qaeda forces in Rabat, Afghanistan resulted in the capture of Osama bin Laden's sons Saad and Hamza.  This is disputed strongly by U.S. counterterrorism officials.    Reuters quotes Zehri  as saying that because the raid took place in Afghanistan, Pakistani forces were not involved, and Zehri also says later that   he did not know  whether Bin Laden's sons were among the captives.  In addition, the governor of Nimroz, the Afghan province in which the operation allegedly took place, said   no arrests were being made .  As USA Today notes, this is just one story full of conflicts to come out over the last few days - some of which indicate Osama Bin Laden himself has either been captured or cornered.  The truth seems to be that   operations seeking to find him seem to have intensified, at least somewhat .  Some of the best stories I've seen  relating to the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed are coming out of Australia's   The Age .  One from March 7 details how the U.S.   manipulated Mohammed's communications  in order to capture him.  An article by Zahid Hussain in the Melbourne Herald Sun says Bin Laden himself was tracked because of his cell phone use.  Another good   March 8 article  in   The Age  (remember, they're on the other side of the world) follows the rumors regarding the capture of Bin Laden mentioned above.  An interesting idea raised in the article is that some people want to see Bin Laden killed, but not report the murder, so that he will fade away instead of being allowed to become a martyr.
