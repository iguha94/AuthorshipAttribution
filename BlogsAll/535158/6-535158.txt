            GET TO YOUR LOCAL McDONALD'S BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!    McDonald's  plans to shift to a healthier fry oil. &nbsp;Seeing as the current fry oil causes patrons' bodies to seize up due to arterial clogging, that's probably a good idea.  Not to mention growing competition from healthy [by comparison]   Subway . &nbsp;However,   McDonald's has actually put off the shift to the new fry oil indefinitely  . . . meaning it can't possibly taste as good as the current super-fatty fry oil. &nbsp;In fact, the article suggests that the change, put through under the tenure of now-departed CEO Jack Greenberg, would lead to a change in taste that could lose McDonald's some customers. &nbsp;So my suggestion to all those who enjoy a good batch of fries is to go out and get some before indignant health advocates decide to force McDonald's to follow through on its promise to disarm, er, I mean, shift to less fatty oil.  But McDonald's doesn't have to worry about my business, no matter what fry oil they use. &nbsp;As anyone who's eaten there would agree, the best fries in the world (and some of the best fried food in general) can be found at the   Ollie's Trolley  at 1426 L Street (near the corner of 15 th  & L) in Northwest D.C. &nbsp;With a host of different spices flavoring these strips of potato wonderment, Ollie's fries smell tremendous and taste even better. &nbsp;There's another Ollie's in D.C., at 425 12 th  Street, but despite the 1970s decor, that Ollie's isn't half as greasy good. &nbsp;Oh, and you can't order tabbouleh along with your cheesesteak and fries there like you can at the one at 15 th  & L.
