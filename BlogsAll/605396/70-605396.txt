A quick spin through the local news:      Bankruptcies on the rise   - No surprise there. George Butler, a local lawyer specializing in bankruptcies, predicts 2003 will be a banner year for bankruptcy filings on Guam, especially once the inevitably happens and GovGuam starts laying off employees.     Arguments heard in bond case   - The Supreme Court of Guam heard arguments for and against the government's proposed bond bailout measure yesterday. They will render a decision in a few days.     State funeral set for Angel Santos   - Next week a state funeral will be held for former senator Angel Santos. I still can't believe he is gone. The media reported him as having Parkinson's, but it seems like the progress of the disease was incredibly fast. I've known a few people with Parkinson's and it always seemed a gradual deterioration to me. I know the medical examiner performed an autopsy, I am curious to know the results.     Public library reducing hours   - The Agat Branch of the Guam Public Library is now only open on Tuesdays. Seems the salary reductions and budget shortfalls encouraged a number of library employees to leave Guam. The library is now too short-staffed to operate the main branch, the Dededo branch and the Agat branch every day. The poor state of the library system on island breaks my heart.     Tire recycling takes off   -  On a positive note, a local recycling firm unveiled a new process to reduce the number of old tires on island. The new machine crushes up to 100 old tires into a compact 4x4x2 cube, which can be used for a number of purposes; road beds, retaining walls or erosion control. Good to hear about somebody doing something to reduce waste on island.
