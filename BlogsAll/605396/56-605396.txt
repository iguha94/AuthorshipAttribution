Looks like the Guam Visitors Bureau (GVB) can join the airport in shady contracts with foreign consultants.   Today's PDN reports  that GVB also signed a contract with China Link during the final months of Carl Gutierrez's administration, and paid out $34,000 to the firm before the management turnover in January. Lovely. These independent agencies that don't have to follow the general government procurement regulations are rife with these blatant rewards and kickbacks for allies and associates. They ought to be ashamed, instead these people are laughing all the way to the bank.  At least I can rest assured that these surreptitious dealings are not a thing of the past.   KUAM ran a story  last night about GEDCA's controversial and expensive contract with a Washington D.C. lobbying group. This lobbying firm was incorporated on Guam the day the contract was signed by GEDCA. Apparently the high powered lobbying firm is actually a local group that will attempt to subcontract the lobbying to various actual lobbying firms in Washington D.C. Basically it does nothing, just collects money and hires out other firms while extracting an exorbitant fee from GovGuam. The story makes it pretty clear that the entire contract is just a form of payback for a political smear campaign against Bob Underwood during the gubernatorial campaign last year. The entire tale is pretty convoluted but it certainly makes a person go "hmmm..." I am sure that given enough time, Governor Camacho will become more adept at rewarding cronies, lackeys and other assorted boot lickers, just like Carl Gutierrez did in his 2 terms.
