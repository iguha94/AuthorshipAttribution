Last week marked   KPRG's  fall pledge drive. I cannot stress enough how valuable KPRG is to Guam. The sole public radio, community radio station on island, KPRG offers a diverse mix of   NPR ,   PRI , and   local programming . This is an unusual situation. Other public radio stations are usually entirely NPR or entirely PRI programming, never a mix of the two. And community radio is usually something completely different. Only here on Guam is there a blend of all three. A highly eclectic blend.   This morning KPRG played a rerun of an old   Performance Today  broadcast from last month, the final partitas #6 of   The Bach Partitas with Richard Goode . Excellent.   The second hour of PT  was the current program, climaxing with Stravinsky's Rite of Spring at the new   Walt Disney Concert Hall . Wow.  And   All Things Considered  ran a   fascinating piece by Walter Cronkite  about his involvement in CBS' television show "You Are There" during the 1950's. Unknown to Cronkite and most of the show's staff, all the writers on the "You Are There" were   blacklisted  screenwriters. The writers used historical allegory to make thinly disguised comments about the communist witch hunts of the   McCarthy  era. It was an absolutely fascinating story, and a true delight to hear Walter Cronkite's voice again.  When I think of the drivel being broadcast on commercial radio on a daily basis, it makes the value of a station like KPRG and NPR truly exceptional. Now if only they would run   Whad'Ya Know  here on Guam. That is one of my favorites on PRI.
