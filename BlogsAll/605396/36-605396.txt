I left Guam on December 21. I arrived in St. Louis on December 21, after 24 hours of travel. Go figure.  Spent four days at   Cape Albeon , the  senior living community  that my parents moved into during 2001. Yeah, I was hanging at the old folks home for a week. Hell, played lots of cards, had internet access, digital cable, housekeeping service, indoor pool and jacuzzi, exercise room, and two meals a day in the main dining room. My parents love it there, and I can see why. It's like a luxury college dorm, just full of old people.  It snowed on Christmas Eve. Over seven inches. My first White Christmas in ten years or more.  My niece Kristine was married on December 27 th . This joyous event brought the entire family together for the first time in five years. Of course I was the missing link in all previous family get togethers. The family celebrated a raucous Christmas the next day at my brother Jim's.  Spent the following week in Chicago with my sister   Nancy . Movies, music, museums, mass transit. Ah, big city living for a week! New Year's was fun, lots of champagne (let's hear it for   Veuve Clicquot Brut !! Yah!)   The Field  was a little disappointing but the   Art Institute  had a couple great exhibits. And the   Lincoln Park Zoo  was a fun afternoon.  I got marooned in Houston for a couple days on my return. Thanks Continental. Luckily my good friend Craig was there to put me up for a couple nights. He's a hell of a guy. I got a chance to enjoy his great homebrewed beer and hit some pretty cool bars in his neighborhood. And I wasn't in any hurry to get back to Guam anyhow.  Brought back a bunch of   books  to Guam. I was disappointed to find my power was still out, over a month since the typhoon and lines are still littering the street. What's up with that??
