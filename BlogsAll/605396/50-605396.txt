I don't think I mentioned gasoline prices on Guam, but let me quickly bring readers up to speed. Regular unleaded sells for $2.11 99/100  right now at all the island gas stations. Last month during the height of the War on Iraq gasoline was $2.06 99/100 . Gas prices after Typhoon Pongsana were about $1.94 99/100 , and that was during the fuel shortage and rationing.    So gasoline prices are going up . Petroleum companies are always quick to justify the increases; Guam is a small market, so smaller tanker ships are used; our fuel comes from Singapore, not mainland U.S. were prices are cheaper; the cost of doing business on Guam is high because of insurance; and the latest - GovGuam's 50% gross receipts tax hike.  Still I find it galling to listen to this litany of excuses in the face of worldwide reports on the dramatically falling price of oil. Gasoline prices Stateside are plummeting, oil production is booming. Why are the costs rising on Guam?  Let me explain. Only three companies peddle gasoline on Guam. They got our nuts in a vice, and they can squeeze as much as they like. There is nothing we can do about this but whine and complain. The market on Guam is too stagnant to lure another oil company on island, so the big three are content to wring blood from a stone and only offer these lame excuses in reply.  I guess it is time for me to start cycling to work again. It takes longer, but the equation of time vs. money is swinging away from the costly convenience of my own automobile. Too bad the mass transit system here sucks and is nigh unto useless. I would happily ride the bus to work everyday, if the bus actually ran a real route to my village. The current system of 'call this number and we'll send a micro-bus your way in a couple hours - maybe' just doesn't work.  Can anybody guess who filled up his tank with overpriced gasoline today?
