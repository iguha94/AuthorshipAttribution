Recently Watched DVD's:      Starfire Mutiny  - It sucked than I thought it would. Much worse.    The Rules of Attractions  - Loathsome, but it had it's moments.    Road to Perdition  - Predictable, but not bad. Typical Hollywood 'serious' fare.    Moonlight Mile  - Wallowing morosity, and I don't like that young actor Jake whatever. Smirks too damn much.    The Four Feathers  - This was just incomprehensible. A mess with plenty of bad acting all around.    Virtual Sexuality  - not at all what I expected -   Weird Science  for the 90's    Luzhin Defence  - Very interesting, I enjoyed this.    Trees Lounge  - Another movie with Steve Buscemi as a loser who scores a hot teenager. I sense a trend. It was pretty good, nice portrayal of rummies in a bar.
