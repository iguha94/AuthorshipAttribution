This time every year my thoughts turn to    Kubota Diesel Generators , an excellent diesel generator that runs whisper quiet and supplies ample amounts of electricity to power an entire home. The neighbor up the street installed one after Typhoon Chata'an last year, and he certainly got his money's worth out of it after Typhoon Pongsana. The power was out over two months here on Chalan Ayuyu, and Mr. Taitano's house was brilliantly lit every night. We were all seething with envy during the gasoline shortage immediately after the typhoon too, because diesel supplies were unaffected by the fuel dump fire. While we sweltered in darkness, his Kubota purred along all night powering his air conditioner, refrigerator, lights and television.  Of course the   thing costs over $13,000 , but it's worth it. Besides,   Morrico , the local dealer for Kubota, offers excellent service and repair options.  I mention this because I read   Paul Boutin's    article  at   Slate  about the joys of owning a backup generator for power outages. When he quoted $2100 for a 2.5 kW generator, I about choked on my breakfast. That guy got fleeced. Morrico sells   a rock-solid 6.5 kW gasoline generator for $2150 . And that's ridiculously expensive. After Chata'an, Dianne bought a 5.5 kW   Porter-Cable    gasoline generator for $600 , plus shipping. If all you need is to run a few light bulbs or a fan, I'd suggest getting a   power inverter  for the car, which changes the 12 volt DC power into AC for the household appliances to use. It's good for a temporary solution, which is all most people will ever need.  I'm off to the movies now, perhaps I'll write more about alternative power sources like solar and fuel cells this evening.
