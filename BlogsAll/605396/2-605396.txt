Things are returning to normal on Guam. My power was restored last Thursday, water service has been good, and my cable tv came back on Wednesday night. That first night back with the air conditioning was a very good thing. It has been so hot and muggy the past two weeks, not a breath of wind. Rainy season sure arrived early this year. People are blaming it on el Niï¿½o.  I cleared most of the remaining debris from the yard last weekend, though I still have some wood that I need to burn. I decided to burn the bougainvillea rather than carry it out. The thorns are vicious on those things. I couldn't believe the amount of email that was piled up from ten days of not checking it. And most of that was spam. It is really getting out of control. I can't imagine that anyone ever responds to those things.  Anyway, here are some useful links to storm related sites. By far the most useful is the   Joint Typhoon Warning Center , a naval outfit that actually handles all the storm forecasting for the Pacific and Indian Oceans. But another good site is the   National Weather Service - Tiyan Office , which has a really good doppler radar image loop. That was instrumental in the hours leading up to the storm. Watching the approaching typhoon I knew it was going to be bad.  Tomorrow morning I am coming in to move my computer and files into a new office. I hope it doesn't take too long.  Just finished listening to Baka's  Baka Beyond  and starting Keola Beamer's  Mauna Kea, White Mountain Journal  in the CD player. Nothing like a little slack key on a rainy Friday afternoon.
