I promised a couple weeks ago to avoid mentioning the recent elections; but I really need to point out a recent development.  The PDN is suddenly   starting  a   crusade    against  a   convicted felon  that was   elected  to the newly created   school board . While the newspaper's efforts are to be commended, this reflects a serious lapse in the media's role as a watchdog for the public trust. This information was readily available; it was known to the Guam Election Commission, which requires police clearance before a candidate can file for office; it was in the public record at the courts; it was know by numerous island residents who suffered at this man's expense, but no mention of his past was made in the newspaper or other island media. Even I knew about his record, just from a casual conversation with a friend that was the victim of this crook's fraud.  For crying out loud, the guy has two social security numbers and goes by an alias. Yet he says he is reformed, a changed man that wants to make a difference for his island.  Particularly galling is the revelation that this felon is scheduled to go on trial in 2003 for criminal sexual conduct. This man, a known thief, convicted for writing  bad checks , is overseeing of our school system. Wonderful. And due to an oversight in the legislation creating the school board, it is perfectly legal for him to sit on this board. I find this development disturbing. How could this happen?
