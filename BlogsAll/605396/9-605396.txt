I eat my words. The upgrade is not a possibility and I am ticked off at the way it was handled.  Here's the deal. The "executive administrative assistant" at work booked these tickets on   Northwest  over the internet instead of using a real travel agency on Guam. I guess it was her thought to save some dollars. Well in the course of trying to get my upgrade this morning, I discovered that the ticket was only reserved, it hadn't been purchased yet. Turns out she supplied the wrong address for the corporate credit card and it didn't process correctly. So I had to spend hours on the phone this morning to fix the situation and get the tickets issued. She certainly couldn't be bothered to do her job, especially since the plan president is off island. Since she reports directly to him, she doesn't even bother to come into work when he's not around.  So I finally got the ticket issued, that was step one. Step two involved calling   Continental  to get the upgrade since I accrue my miles on Continental's OnePass program. That turned into another half hour on the phone before finding out that my fare was not upgradeable. So another call to Northwest, another 20 minutes on the phone, another $271 and the fare is now upgradeable.  Called Continental again. Now all available upgrade seats are taken. None are left on any leg of the journey except the 3 hour flight from Guam to Narita. ARGHHH!!! So it looks like I will be sitting in a damn coach seat for my trip. Though the rep at Continental said to call again tomorrow and hope for the best. Great, just great.
