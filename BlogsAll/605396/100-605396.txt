Week 10 of fantasy football saw one team emerge in sole possession of first place in the   Guam Fantasy Football League . Yes, yours truly is sitting in cat bird seat, with four more weeks of regular season play and then the finals. One more week of inter-divisional play, then it's back into the Central Division to secure our playoff spot. It won't be a cake walk though, the Central Division is the toughest in the league, all four teams capable of breakout performances. Still, we stand a good chance of winning our division, or at least securing the wild card playoff berth. The pot for fantasy football is almost $700 this year. I could sure use that money. Especially right before Christmas.  It was a good week for   the Zulus . We traded away   Santana Moss , our 12 th  round pick for   Steve McNair , the #1 fantasy quarterback in our league. Frankly I am amazed the trade was approved. Quite a coup for us. And since last week was the supplemental draft, we picked up a number of promising players like   Rudi Johnson  and   Jim Kleinsasser . Rudi was a really choice catch and he proved it by becoming our leading scorer for the weekend, powering us past Da Bruddahs. I think the team looks pretty solid, especially now that all the bye weeks are over and we have a solid roster. No more switching in scrubs to garner a few points while the starters take the weekend off.
