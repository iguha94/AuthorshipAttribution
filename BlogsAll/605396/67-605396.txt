Did I mention my parents saw the Archbishop of the   Archdioceses of Agana  in St. Louis last month? Well they did. Hell, I probably mentioned it last month already. Just thought I'd bring it up again.  Read    Whale Rider   today. For a small book, it was chock full of cogent thoughts and insights. I hope   the film  comes to Guam.  Watched    28 days Later   today as well. Not a terribly bad film, overall about what I expected from a zombie movie. The lead actress,   Naomie Harris , was quite good. A real scene-stealer, she nailed her performance dead to rights. I'll keep an eye out for her in the future.  Took the new PT Cruiser round for a spin today. It's nice owning a new car. It looks good, it runs good, it smells new. I think the best part is the freedom from worry and anxiety that the old Isuzu injected into my life. "Will it break down or get me in an accident? What's it going to cost me this time to get it running again?" And the worst part? Well I am a lot poorer now, and I will be making payments for a few years. That always sucks. But I am glad I did it. No regrets, no worries.  I'm actually looking forward to going into work tomorrow. The onus of dealing with the important projects is off for the rest of the year. It will start up again next year, but I've got about five months now to work on projects that really interest me, instead of running an endless series of analyses on healthcare costs and trends, producing claim triangles, or calculating   IBNR  lag files. We're doing some major upgrades to our core business software, and also upgrading our servers. We've also gotten the green light to build a data warehouse, something I've been hollering about for over a year now. It's time to have some fun and try some new stuff.
