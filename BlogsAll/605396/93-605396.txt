The Cubs were   denied yesterday  in their quest for the World Series and vindication as a sports team. But the real nail in their coffin was in   Game 6 . The fan. That foul ball in the eighth inning.  Damned by their own fan. Or at least in the eyes of many, he is the scapegoat, the sacrificial lamb.  I feel tremendous pity for Steve Bartman. He did nothing wrong, yet the hatred of an entire city is focused on him. If I was in his place, I would have done the exact same thing.  Things got pretty ugly for the guy   pretty quick . He was escorted out of the stadium with a coat over his head, while irate fans pelted him with beer and murderous threats. The crowd outside Wrigley Field was pretty ugly and all riled up.  Then the   Chicago Sun-Times  ran the poor guy's   name and personal information . He is Steve Bartman, 26. A resident of Chicago's North Side and a Notre Dame graduate, Bartman actually coaches little league ball and is a devout Cubs fan.   Suffice to say he was disconsolate  at his hand in bringing about the Cub's downfall. He was under police guard during Game 7 yesterday, and his home phone number has been disconnected.  But let's face it. Chicago loves the Cubs because they are a hard-luck team. They are sultans of despair. They blew the NLCS in colossal style,   snatching defeat from the jaws of victory . And Chicagoland loves 'em for it. They are the lovable losers, with a century of hard luck behind them. It takes determination to be Cubs fan, to revel in the pain it brings. Reminds me of that song    Waiting In Vain  : Like Bob Marley, Cubs fans are more in love with the waiting than the girl (or the team).
