I heard a couple tidbit this weekend about a couple things.    Seems   Pyra Labs , the company that runs   Blogger ,   has been purchased  by   Google . It will be interesting to see how this develops in the next few months. I like Blogger, but I have a few complaints (mostly about   my archives  - what's up with that? Fix it already guys). Hopefully this new situation will stabilize the development of Blogger and iron out a few of the more irritating bugs. That seems to be a   common complaint  too.   And the rumors are flying about   Salon's    imminent demise . This distresses me, since I have been a regular reader of Salon for a number of years. Lately it's been on of my core sources for world news, commentary and information. It would suck to lose this outlet, because   My Yahoo  and   CNN  just blow. I was willing to pony up the cash for a membership at Salon, but apparently they can't muster enough subscribers to make ends meet. The   discussion of this at MetaFilter  has been very anti-Salon. The great unwashed take Salon and David Talbot to task for his lavish compensation, prime location in downtown San Francisco for the Salon offices and a number of other profligate excesses.    I welcome my new Google overlords, and swear my undying fealty to the Google regime.  Perhaps I may suggest they archive all of Salon's articles while they still have a chance?
