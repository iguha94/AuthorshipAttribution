Today I am working from home. It's not bad. No morning commute, I can listen to the radio as loud as I want, I'm sitting here in shorts and t-shirt. This telecommuting thing is a good idea. I should try and do it more often.  Unfortunately, this pleasure of home bound work is due to automobile problems. Funny, I think my Isuzu knows I am thinking about getting a new vehicle. This morning I had a flat tire. Well not completely flat, but very low. I could probably head out and stop at the gas station a 1/2 mile up the road. I started up the engine and heard an ungodly racket. I think my clutch is burned up, and I can think of no better reason to buy a new car. The damn thing is just falling apart in front of my very eyes.  Perhaps the reason a new car has been on my mind lately was because I subconsciously suspected my vehicle was near death? The mind is a powerful thing, perhaps my unconscious knew something the rational mind didn't comprehend. That could be, but it's really a combination of factors:   No air conditioning in the Amigo  The extreme susceptibility of the soft top to theft and the elements  The age of my Isuzu - 14 years and counting  The brakes need work  The clutch needs to be replaced  The crappy fuel economy of the SUV  The rust that has literally exploded throughout the body in the last year  I guess all these factors combined add up to a new car for Tom. Probably the main impetus for auto replacement is the robbery three weeks ago. That was the third time the Isuzu was broken into, and I am just sick of it. I want a secure automobile, with air conditioning, that runs well, and gets good mileage. The urge is growing. I guess I'll spend the weekend auto shopping in earnest. And getting the Amigo fixed.
