I watched   Koyaanisqatsi  several times over the last couple weeks. First time in a very long time - over ten years. It still moves me.  The photography is amazing, and the Philip Glass score dazzles  me.  I also watched   Powaqqatsi  last week. While I like that sequel, it is not as powerful a vision as Koyaanisqatsi. Koyaanisqatsi dazzles with images of technology, our shining beast. Powaqqatsi lectures on the sins on modernization, visited upon the third world. The images are still spectacular, but the viewer is browbeaten by the singular message. With Koyaanisqatsi, an ambiguity exists -  is this glittering pinnacle of technology a good or bad thing?  Powaqqatsi solidly affirms that the modern world is a bad thing, and that salvation lies in the traditional world. That view is too one dimensional, and it lacks the impact. The first film offers a new perspective on reality, allowing the viewer to draw her own conclusions. The second dictates what the viewer must feel.  I mention this because I will shortly be picking up the third film in the series,   Naqoyqatsi , which I have never seen before. This is   Godfrey Reggio's  first film since the internet revolution and 9/11, it was released late last year. I am curious what grim images it will unleash. I suspect it is not going to be a pleasant film.  Koyaanisqatsi  is Hopi for 'Life out of Balance,'  Powaqqatsi  translates as 'Life in Transformation,' but  Naqoyqatsi  means 'Life as War.' An ill portent.
