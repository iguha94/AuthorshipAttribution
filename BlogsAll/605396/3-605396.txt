Well typhoon Chata'an struck Guam early Friday morning and lashed the island with wind up to 110 knots. It was a tough storm. Many lost their houses, the power grid was demolished, phones are intermittent, water is sketchy and failing. Yesterday another typhoon passed Guam, the second in five days. Typhoon Ha Long passed 60 miles south of Guam, but the winds were still fierce and caused further damage. Today is the first time I actually sat down in front of a computer in a week. Our office at work suffered moderate water damage when a section of the roof was torn off. We had to relocate the entire building's staff into temporary quarters while management searches for a new location for our offices. I am currently ensconced in an empty exam room with two others from my department. This area is full of people, but we are better off than some departments. Four entire departments got shoehorned into one little store front over the weekend. It looks like a can of human sardines in there. The power is expected to be off for 6 - 8 weeks while the power crews restring lines and test circuits. Not cool. I am looking into purchasing a gas backup generator for my place. Suffice to say these items are in short supply right now and demand is high.  Back to work now... It's actually satisfying to do my job instead of all the shit labor moving furniture and files or clearing out my backyard. Besides I am in air conditioning here.
