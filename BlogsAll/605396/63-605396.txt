Take a gander at   this fascinating article  about the dust cloud in our solar system, and what it means for astronomers searching for other solar systems. Basically our solar system looks like a gigantic dust doughnut with the sun in the center. The hole of the doughnut was scoured out by Jupiter and the other gas giants, and Neptune's gravity keeps the remaining dust cloud in check, far beyond our inner world's orbit. Astronomers are now looking for similar doughnuts around other stars.         This image is just blows my mind. The four orbits are those of the gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Look at how Neptune is carving out a hole in the dust cloud. Also note how the density of the cloud clusters in two areas ahead and behind of Neptune. This is eerily reminiscent of Jupiter's   Trojan asteroids , viewable in this   APOD graphic  from last year. The Trojans are the blue dots on the edge of the photo, preceding and trailing Jupiter along the edges of the graphic - all that green stuff is the asteroid belt.   The same gravitational forces are in play, locking the dust into the same orbit at Neptune. I don't want to sound too geeky, but the dust   accumulates  in Neptune's L4 and L5   Lagrange Points,  stable orbits described by the mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange. Lagrange indicated 5 semi-stable points in the orbit of one body around a larger one. L1 is on a line between the two bodies, L2 is on the same line, but beyond the second smaller body, L3 is located on that same imaginary line, but on the opposite side of the large center mass, and the L4 and L5 points precede and trail the smaller body. For the curious NASA's   SOHO solar observatory  sits in Earth's L1 point, staring down at the sun. This graphic illustrates the Lagrange points nicely.      I just get off on this stuff. The idea that our solar system has such a telltale signal bodes well for future explorations. This cannot locate earth like planets, but it can help pinpoint stable solar systems with gas giants located on the outskirts of systems. Currently methods can only discern gigantic rogue worlds, orbiting much too close to their parent star to harbor life.  I expect looking for dust clouds like this will become a standard technique in locating earth-like solar systems. Astronomers have already located a dust cloud around   Epsilon Eridani,  and they are studying it closely. Hopefully more stars will give up their secrets in the future.
