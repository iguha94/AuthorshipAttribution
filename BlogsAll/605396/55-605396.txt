Several years ago I watched a fascinating program on PBS:    Affluenza.   God, did that program hit home. The sickness that comes from having too much stuff. I look around my house and I realize I got too much stuff. Multiple computers, collections of things, sets of books, closets full of crap that I never use, yet I still collect more shit. Trying to fill the void of my life with possessions. There's even a book,   Affluenza,  detailing the subject in more depth. The author of the book, John de Graaf, is also the producer of the documentary. The program suggests possible cures to this disorder. The message is basically to live a simpler, balanced life. Stop buying stuff. Take the bus. "Pretend the Jones' are the thriftiest, least wasteful people on the block. Then try to keep up with them."  There was an article in   Utne Reader  several months ago, analyzing this culture of consumption from a Marxist perspective. The   Hidden Life of Garbage  (sorry - it's not free) documents how the landfill commoditized trash, making the reuse of discarded objects illegal and promoting consumption as a method to sustain the consumer economy. Interesting read. I'd suggest checking the local library for the back issue instead of shelling out a couple bucks to read it online though.  Anywho, I came across   this editorial  on the NY Times website today also written by John de Graaf. The basic gist of the article is how Americans work more than Western Europeans, and while we value  things , they value  time . Western Europeans take nine weeks of paid vacation a year, while Americans average two weeks. De Graaf finishes the article by announcing October 24 as the first    Take Back Your Time Day,   a day to reflect on the overworked and overscheduled lives we lead. October 24 was chosen because it is nine weeks before Christmas, representing the difference in lifestyles between Europe and America.
