The weather has been crazy lately. Lots of thunderstorms looming over the island. A Japanese tourist was   struck and killed  last week. But I guess thunderstorms are expected at this time of year. Tony Sanchez, director of the Superior Court, wrote a   good editorial  last week that mentioned the   ancient Chamoru calendar  and the names they used for August and September.  August was the eighth moon cycle of the year, called "Tenhos," which means "angry or out of patience." Given the increase in temperature and the reaction to hot humid August summer nights, impatience and anger were descriptive.   The month of September, or the ninth moon cycle, was called "lamlam" or "lumamlam," meaning "lightning." Recent lightning storms underscore the appropriateness of this name.      I found this   excellent page  on the Pacific World website that included this graphic, which was taken from Lawrence Cunningham's   "Ancient Chamorro Society."  This calendar was probably used for agricultural purposes, and tied to the cycles of the moon like the Chinese or   Japanese Calendars .  Recent discoveries have led to the discovery of   another Chamoru calendar , probably used for different purposes. The months were not based on the   waxing and waning of the moon  like   many calendars , but on the rising of   different constellations , and the calendar was probably used in navigation. A similar calendar is still taught in   Puluwat  and other   outlying Micronesian islands . While not the   oldest identified calendar , this calendar is very old.
