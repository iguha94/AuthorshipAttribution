My apologies for not posting local news here lately. I try to only comment on political imbroglios, and the current situation is unchanged from a few months ago: the governor is still trying   to float a massive bond , the Attorney General   is still dead-set against it , GovGuam workers are still being   furloughed  or forced into   wage reductions , the Republican senators are still trying to   repeal the tax increase  the Democratic senators approved earlier this year and   visitor arrivals are plunging  to 10 year lows.  On a more sordid note, the last two months brought about a rash of murders on the island. In the last two weeks two women were stabbed to death in crimes of passion. In the   first murder  a woman came home to find her boyfriend in bed with another woman. Police found the first woman with a knife through her heart and arrested the second woman.   A grand jury sprung her  late last week though due to lack of evidence.    The second knife murder  was a crime of passion too. A woman was at a local bar with her ex-boyfriend when her cell phone rang. She refused to let the ex-boyfriend see the caller id number, and he allegedly flew into a rage, grabbed a knife off the bar and stabbed her.  Crikey! There was   another stabbing  at a karaoke lounge last night! This is becoming a little too common. Perhaps the stress of a contracting economy is overwhelming people.
