Lately I have developed a burning desire for a telescope. For years I wanted one, but I knew enough to dissuade me from pursuing the matter seriously. I knew those cheap department stores telescopes were next to useless, but the 'astronomical' cost of a quality telescope frightened me. Add to the cost of a scope mandatory extras like a quality mount, motorized slewing, lenses and lord knows what else, and I balked at the idea.  Enter the   Meade ETX  series of telescopes. These small scopes pack a lot of punch for their size. I am seriously considering dropping the cash on one of these. The price isn't unreasonable, and Meade is currently offering a nice deal by tossing in a tripod and a computerized star finder. I think I'll take a couple more days to think it over and check out comparative offers, then take the plunge.  If anything, this purchase is long overdue. I have a reputation among my friends for my stargazing abilities, and I am frequently addressed at parties as the "star man" because I tend to pick out constellations, planets and other phenomena for other guests. It's happened more than once: I'll be browsing the aisles at Blockbuster, or standing in line to get my mail and somebody will say, "Hey, you're the star guy I met at Erin's party a couple weeks ago..." So yes, I think this will be a worthwhile investment, no matter what type of telescope I end up getting.
