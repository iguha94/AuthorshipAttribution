One more post about Tibet and then I will shut up.   I mentioned last week  the increasing popularity of Tibetan Buddhism in the West, due in large part to the Dalai Lama. He recently drew over 65,000 to Central Park. At the same time, the Chinese government is stepping up efforts to assimilate Tibet into the rest of China.  One key component of that assimilation is tourism:   Tibet tourism drive disrupts Buddhist temple life , underscores Chinese control. The influx of tourists has brought the hassle of modern life, and the chase for much-needed cash, into Tibet's ancient society. Even the monks can no longer spend hours contemplating, they must play host to swarms of visitors. While I think the opening of Tibet will inflect even more harm on this captive nation, I cannot deny their right to development and the 21 st  century. It would be ridiculous to cloister them away from the rest of the world, and downright ignorant to expect them to turn their back on modern necessities like running water and power. If tourism and the concomitant loss of culture is the price to pay for modernization, so be it. And I must admit I would like to visit Tibet someday too. Here's the Chinese governments   Tibetan tourism page , full of interesting visit Tibet information. Let's pray that what makes Tibet unique is strong enough to survive the onslaught of tourism.  A good link for Tibet resources is   Tibet Information Network , an independent clearinghouse for Tibetan news and information.  Now if you will excuse, I am heading off to watch a bit of   Robert Thurman's  excellent   Tibet documentary  before I fall asleep.  Esta Gupa!
