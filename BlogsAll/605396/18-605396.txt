Just a quick one, the latest dish on a couple stories featured in the   PDN :    Airport Expenses Audited  - The public auditor last week revealed the results of an audit of the Guam International Airport spending habits.   Her results ? In 1999, the board of directors approved $97,382 in travel expenses. At the end of 1999, Gov.
