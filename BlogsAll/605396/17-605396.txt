This morning I got to thinking that it has been ten years since I shared Thanksgiving with anyone in my family. That got me thinking about where I was for each Thanksgiving since I left St. Louis in 1987 for Beloit. There's a couple I don't exactly recall, the one in 1991 and the one in 1988   1987 - First from Beloit, drove to Chicago with Curtis Meyer, then down to St. Louis. Rigged the lights for   Vianney's  Fall Theater production.  1988 - Thanksgiving in Chicago with Nancy & CJ. Got a ride with Suss in his van, and it lost a wheel near the   Belvedere Oasis . Spent hours at that oasis waiting for his dad to come rescue us. Nancy was terribly worried about my late arrival.  1989 - Thanksgiving in Chicago with Nancy & CJ, met CJ's proteg� Helen. Jem Ripley gave me a ride in his '67 Mustang. Met his folks in Skokie, then drove down to Oak Park.  1990 - Thanksgiving in Chicago with Nancy & CJ, in their new home. Took the bus this time.  1991 - I honestly don't remember. Maybe it was in Farmington at Gary's?  1992 - Went to Elgin, IL for the family get together at Rick & Karen's. It was a tense weekend. I wasn't happy in grad school, and my journey from Columbia to Chicago was via just about every back road and highway I could find. The entire weekend could be summed up as creepy.  1993 - First Thanksgiving in Guam, ate dinner with Chris, James, Tillie and her family. Gave thanks that I was on a beautiful island.  1994 - The Best Thanksgiving Ever. Beachside in Tamuning with David, Jenny, Brad and Craig. We had a bonfire on the beach after sunset, then all ended up at my place, content and sleepy.  1995 - Turkey with the Goldbergs at Alupang Condos. First tasted Jason Goldbergs sweet potato souffl� - wow.  1996 - Mid-afternoon turkey dinner with Jason Goldberg and his friends off Mamis Street in Tamuning. This was a bunch of Sandcastle dancers, I remember that vividly.  1997 - The season of many turkeys. Ate a killer meal at Mel & Craig's place in Agana Heights, turkey with all the trimmings. Everything done up like Martha Stewart. Then off to Tamuning for another meal with Craig, Darren and Cindy. I was hurting by the end of the night.  1998 - Started with a mid-afternoon meal with David and the Tobi boys in Mangilao, then more turkey at the Koon's place atop Nimitz Hill.  1999 - Arrived back from Bali in the morning, then spent the evening with Mel & Craig. The infamous turkey carcass   congee  with Annie.  2000 - House sitting for Mel & Craig, Annie was staying there as well. She went somewhere in Tumon, I was under the weather and moped around. I don't think I even ate turkey that day.  2001 - Kim & Suzanne hosted a dinner at their place, Cyrus & Jen, Steve & Katie and several other people were there. I fried a turkey! And it was good.  2002 - Looks like I am hosting the party this year for a few friends. I am frying another turkey of course, those things are 'da bomb!'
