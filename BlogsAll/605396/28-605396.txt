Movies  - I watched a couple movies over the last few days; some surprisingly good, other disappointingly bad. First the good:    Y tu mam� tambi�n   was good, certainly nothing wrong lots of hot sex, though the plot was a tad predictable. Hell really predictable. But I enjoyed it at the time.    The Time Machine   was a special effects laden bit of fluff, but then that was exactly what I expected it to be. It was loosely based on H.G. Wells seminal work, though it owed a great deal more to   the 1960 version  directed by George Pal. It passed a couple hours in an agreeable manner, and   the heroine  was certainly easy on the eyes.  On the disappointing side I received    Angels & Insects   on Friday from   Netflix . I was expecting more. God, it was difficult to watch the movie. It obviously was made with a great deal of artifice, but the metaphors are blunt and wear thin quickly. Yes, yes, yes, I understand. The civilized world is more savage than the Amazon. La dee dah. Yawn. It's going back tomorrow. A waste of my time. And it got such good reviews. I guess there's no telling for taste.   Magazines  - My first   Utne Reader  finally arrived in the mail on Friday. About time. I subscribed back in late September. This is a common problem with magazines here on Guam. In fact Friday's mail also include my new Rolling Stone, from September 5 th . So I have a pile of magazines to read;   Utne ,   Outside, ,   National Geographic ,   Rolling Stone ,   Macworld , and   Archaeology . I find that my magazine reading has slackened as I become more addicted to blogs and the daily ruminations of a dozen or so web logs I follow. Or maybe I am just getting bored with my magazines and need to find a new collection to interest me.   Books  - Still reading Hardy's  Return of the Native , though I expect to finish that either today or tomorrow. Then it's on to  Les Miserables  and  Gravity's Rainbow . Some dense reading to finish up the year.
