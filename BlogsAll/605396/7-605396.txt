I like   Blogger.  I really do. But I think I need something closer to what   Eastgate  makes,   Tinderbox . Instead of creating blogs, Tinderbox focuses on creating and managing thoughts. The weblog feature of Tinderbox is almost an afterthought. What I really need is something to get a handle on the people, emails, projects, data and meetings I juggle during a typical day at work. It looks like Tinderbox would do that nicely.  But that only works on the Macintosh platform right now, and whether I like it or not, I spend most of my time on Windows 2000 boxes now at work. The Mac is a luxury I come home to in the evenings, but that is just not the most creative or alert time of my day. I just want to vegetate after a long day at work, watch a little TV or browse the web briefly. I don't have the time or energy to devote to something like Tinderbox at home. And I often don't remember thoughts or reminders eight hours after I wanted to write myself a little note about them. I am in information overload, like so many other people today.  Enter   The Brain . This company makes a very slick product, similar to Tinderbox called the Personal Brain. I downloaded it today and I am going to give it a test drive at home. If I like it, I'll probably install it on my machine at work so I can start to get a handle on the information I deal with everyday.
