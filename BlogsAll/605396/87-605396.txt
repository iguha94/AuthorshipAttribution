The New Yorker has an   excellent article  about the impending death of the   Galileo space probe . On September 21 st , the aging probe will plunge into Jupiter's violent atmosphere and incinerate. This drastic step is being taken to avoid contamination of Europa, Jupiter's liquid moon. Scientists are not willing to risk having an underpowered probe rattling about around Jupiter, possibly harboring some especially hardy Terran microbes that could reach the surface of the icy moon. So Galileo is committing suicide before the last of its propellant is used up and it becomes a derelict.  The tale of Galileo's voyage to the Jovian system is an incredible adventure. Long delayed due to the 1986 Challenger disaster, it took a long and winding route to reach Jupiter. Along the way the high gain antenna, the link to earth, refused to unfold, threatening to ruin the mission. Instead, engineers managed to rewrite the probe's software to send highly compressed data along a small, slow backup antenna.  The Galileo mission is an excellent example of what   NASA  should be doing in space, sending out robotic probes to the far reaches of the solar system. Instead the agency fritters time and money into tossing a few astronauts into orbit, a costly fixation that provides little real scientific data. To spend so much time playing around in near earth orbit, measuring long term zero gravity effects on the human body or observing bees making honeycombs, while the untapped mysteries of the solar system beckon is amazingly shortsighted.   The outer planets beckon! Send an armada of probes to Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and Pluto. Stop putting astronauts in space, with such   awful and dangerous consequences .
