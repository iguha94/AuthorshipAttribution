 What's New and Cool in SQL Server "Yukon" :   Big thing #1:  T-SQL has several new data types, including native handling for XML data, which is covered in the following section.  There are also three new data-related data types: Date, Time and UtcDateTime.  These new types have better accuracy and range than their existing counterparts, DateTime and SmallDateTime.  (You can say that again)  They are also special implementations of .NET user-defined data types, and thus they have several special properties and methods that allow you to get portions of the date or time and even convert it to a string using a user-specified format.  Big thing #2:  T-SQL now has the ability to pivot and unpivot data. No more dynamic T-SQL or overly complex SELECT statements ï¿½ now you can use this new ability to create crosstabulated data results. These two SELECT statements will give the same results, but obviously, the second is a lot easier to write, especially if we are dealing with more than three pivoted output columns. SELECT ProductID, ProductName,       SUM(CASE TheYear WHEN 1996 THEN Extended ELSE 0 END) AS [1996],      SUM(CASE TheYear WHEN 1997 THEN Extended ELSE 0 END) AS [1997],      SUM(CASE TheYear WHEN 1998 THEN Extended ELSE 0 END) AS [1998] FROM vwOrderDetails GROUP BY ProductID, ProductName  SELECT * FROM vwOrderDetails PIVOT (SUM(Extended) FOR TheYear IN ([1996], [1997], [1998])) AS PVT  I make a lot of crosstabs, this will come in  very  handy.
