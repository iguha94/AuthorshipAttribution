I just realized I made a mistake this evening. I left my   Psion  at work. Normally this wouldn't bother me too much, but I am only five chapters from the end of    Bleak House  , which is stowed on the Psion in a text file I downloaded from the   Project Gutenberg . Crap.   Oh wait - it's on my hard drive here too. I can read it from my computer this evening and finish the novel. Cool! I really enjoy pulling down old novels from Project Gutenberg - a vast digital library at my fingertips.  Onto Dickens, I really do enjoy Dickens. His stories contain a wealth of unforgettable characters, which often causes the plot to slow down in the first half of the book. But as the plot speeds up, Dickens throws in the most remarkable connections and coincidences to throw his characters together. As the conclusion nears, I can rarely put down the story. I was up until 3:00 last night reading  Bleak House , and I will probably stay up tonight until I finish it.  Well before it gets too late, I am off to watch a DVD now.    'Round Midnight   is on the docket for this evening. Been a long time since I've seen this homage to jazz, but I am looking forward to it. Hell, any movie with Dexter Gordon jammin' like mad is worth sitting back and watching.
