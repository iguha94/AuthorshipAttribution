I just completed something I was working on all week while I was home sick. Yeah, it was a video game. I can honestly say I am not a gamer, I rarely play video games of any type. But I had all this time to kill this week, and I was too sick to do much else around the house. So I popped in   Grandia II  and played for several hours each day. I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the story, and the gameplay was fun too. It's been a long time since I finished a fantasy role playing game like that, easily twelve or thirteen years. I think that was   Final Fantasy  on a Nintendo. Things have certainly evolved. The depth of the game was much greater, the graphics were beautiful, the music was good, and the plot seemed more mature.  Still, it wasn't all that different from that game   Ultima IV  I played when I was in high school. Walk around, talk to everybody, pick up a couple friends for your party, kill everything that looks unfriendly, do a bit of shopping, acquire magic and skills, and oh yeah - save the world. The genre hasn't evolved that much. In fact, just by happenstance I stumbled on a   parody site  that nails all these problems right on the head. It had me chuckling.  Like I said, I don't really play a lot of video games. I can count on one hand the games I've played in the last 10 years. Maybe Grandia 2 sucks compared to other games. I enjoyed it though, and isn't that what a video game is all about?
