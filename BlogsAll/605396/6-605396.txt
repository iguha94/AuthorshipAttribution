Rained again this morning. I actually stayed up until 4:30 this morning. It started raining a little after midnight and it was still going strong when I finally hit the sack. Funny how the sun was shining when I went into work a three hours later.  Oh work. Bastion of numerous insurmountable projects with looming deadlines. What the hell! Toss on a couple more must do assignments onto my pile. I used to call it a burden, now I call it job security. I am going to install that Personal Brain software on my machine at work though. I must do something to manage all the myriad tasks I juggle daily. I tried messing with the Brain software over the weekend and it looks like something I can test drive.  Came home this evening to frustration. My air conditioner was dripping last night. Tonight it was a damn waterfall. A little ingenuity solved the problem though. The drainage hose was blocked so after struggling from the inside of the house I retreated outside. I pulled the hose out of the drain pipe, turned on my garden hose, and shot a blast of water up the drainage hose. That cleared it right out and now I am happy again.  My   landlady  took off this morning for a week in Chu'uk diving with the   Blue Lagoon Dive Shop . This is the third trip this year, researching and diving in conjunction with her book on the history of Truk Lagoon. She left me with a couple chores to do in her absence, mostly dog or book related. I don't mind, I get a great deal on the rent in return. We have a   symbiotic  relationship.
