Well, lookie here:  "In the two years since law enforcement agencies gained fresh powers to help them track down and punish terrorists, police and prosecutors have increasingly turned the force of the new laws not on al-Qaida cells but on people charged with common crimes."    New Terror Laws Used Vs. Common Criminals . Looks like that right wing abomination John Ashcroft is quite happy to apply those emergency powers to combat terrorism on   common criminals .   "Within six months of passing the Patriot Act, the Justice Department was conducting seminars on how to stretch the new wiretapping provisions to extend them beyond terror cases," said Dan Dodson, a spokesman for the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys. "They say they want the Patriot Act to fight terrorism, then, within six months, they are teaching their people how to use it on ordinary citizens." [...]  Stefan Cassella, deputy chief for legal policy for the Justice Department's asset forfeiture and money laundering section, said that while the Patriot Act's primary focus was on terrorism, lawmakers were aware it contained provisions that had been on prosecutors' wish lists for years and would be used in a wide variety of cases.   This bodes ill for civil liberties. The powers that were expanded by the Patriot Act were restricted precisely because the Justice department and FBI abused them in the past; wiretaps on civil rights leaders, surveillance of peace activists, J. Edgar Hoover's extensive files on artists, actors and prominent liberals, all culminating in the Republican party spying on the Democratic party headquarters in Watergate. The tendency is for authorities to overstep their bounds and abuse their power. The vast powers authorized by the Patriot Act are a dagger aimed at the heart of democracy.
