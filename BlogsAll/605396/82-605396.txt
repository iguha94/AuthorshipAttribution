Continuing with today's space theme, I got to mention Burt Rutan and   Scaled Composite's  privately funded   drive to achieve sub-orbital space flight . Spaceship 1 is the odds on favorite to win the   X Prize , a $10 million award for the first private venture to reach 100 kilometers in a spacecraft with three people, return safely to earth and repeat the launch within two weeks.  While several X Prize teams are working on smaller versions of traditional rocket launchers, Scaled Composites plan harkens back the to   NASA's X-15  experimental rocket plane flights of   the early sixties . Like the X-15, Spaceship 1 is ferried aloft by a larger conventional jet airplane. Upon reaching approximately 60,000 feet, it detaches and fires a rocket motor for over a minute to propel the spacecraft to 2,500 miles per hour and a maximum altitude of 60 miles. When the propellant is used up, Spaceship 1 becomes a glider and floats down to a runway landing about an hour later.  Unlike most of the X Prize teams, Scaled Composites actually has all the components constructed and in the testing stage. Last month the mother ship White Knight took Spaceship 1 to 47,000 feet and released her for a   controlled glide  back to the desert runway. And just last week the rocket motor was   successfully fired . Next step, mounting the rocket motor to the spaceship and running more in-flight tests.  While Scaled Composites has set no firm launch date, rumors about that they plan their launch to commemorate the 100 th  anniversary of the   Wright brother's  Kitty Hawk flight. That happens on December 3 rd , only a few months away. A new era in space flight may be upon us.
