I just purchased tickets from L.A. to St. Louis over the internet. It was a cheap price and I got 2,000 bonus miles for making the purchase online. This is probably the third or fourth time I've bought tickets off the internet.  I've lost count of how many things I purchase online. Seems like most everything.   Books ,   music ,   hardware    ,   software ,   computers ,   food ,   gift certificates , stuffed animals, toys,   car reservations ,   plane tickets ,   pr0n , just about anything and everything. I've do my   banking  online, I applied for and pay my   credit    cards  online. I buy   stocks  and manage my   401k portfolio  online. It is an integral part of my life. I could not be who I am without the internet. Life on this island would be quite meager indeed without the wonder of online shopping.  Last year for Christmas I got a couple people in my family gift certificates from Amazon and a couple other online places. They both expressed well fear and disappointment that I got them something they would have to redeem online. They both asked the same question:  Is it safe?  Is it safe?? That was a good question to ask in 1994, but in today's world it marks my kindred as 21st century   Luddites . I was leery of placing orders online many years ago too; in fact the first couple orders I placed I paid by check. But the delays in shipping to Guam proved too great, and I switched to online transactions. Now I don't think twice about placing an order online - hell I prefer the internet to 1-800 numbers. Especially since many companies use convicts as their   customer service reps . Giving my credit card number to an incarcerated felon makes me nervous, not using 128 bit encrypted SSL over the internet.
