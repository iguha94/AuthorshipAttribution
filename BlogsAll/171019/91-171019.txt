     What's Your Outlook on Life?     brought to you by   Quizilla    To Miss     Donna Vong    - UCSB Charter #10..(warning - picture intensive entry)  Happy 23rd Birthday!! (dude, I remember when we were celebrating our 20th birthdays...have we gotten that old??)  I've known you since Fall of 1999..living on the 7th floor of San Nic..wow, soo many memories - I really don't know where to begin..we weren't that close starting off when we first met (maybe it was the animosity that we shared the same first name) but we definately grew and went through our ups and downs but all I know is that it only made me love you more and you've redefined the true meaning of sisterhood.  We went through our I.R.I.S. days and you forever will make fun of me not being crafty but it's okay - no one can be a craft nazi like you :cool:  We went through the Gamma Chapter lambda lil sis process and got Tseng...and then, Charter pledgeship (You know that I'm always behind you!)  And once you got your car, you were always down to drive..whether it be in rain or sunshine and whether it be to SLO or to SD...and FOOD - man, we always ate together (must be Annie's influence)...I know exactly what you always order at Jack in the Box..and FOOD coma days...and living wtih you at Garden Court for that one summer where you took care of me when I was sick.  And when I stressed out or wanted to cry, your arms (and chest) were always there for comfort...you gave me the most amazing gift of my twins - Junko & Maggie, and I will be forever grateful to you for that....your letters from England had a "Open Me with a Smile" on the back and managed to cheer me up - you put up with me and my boy-craziness and 'player' stage...and now with our NAB days...yeah, 'nuff said...  Now, despite the distance, you still prove to me over and over again that our friendship does last and grow over time...you've been that solace that I seek out still and words could never describe how much you mean to me and how much we've gone through.  Love you, Don - and I wish you nothing but the best on this special day!                       From Presents to Charter Installs to Alpha Installs with our big bro Tseng                                                   Wow - I'm looking at our pix...we've been all over California - NorCal to SoCal and Texas (twice) and Vegas...more trips!  More Trips!  Happy Bday, Don!  Miss you and love you lots!
