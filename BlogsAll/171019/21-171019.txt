Gosh...there is too much to say.  First and foremost, thank to those of you that have supported me.  I cannot begin to express my gratitude.  I'm sorry for those of you that I hurt.  Sometimes, those sacrifices that count the most are the ones that are unspoken.  They don't feel like sacrifices because you love them so much that you would do anything for them.  My sisters, these past few days, I have shared so much with you that no one else could ever understand and that is what bonds us.  I looked at each one of you last night and I had tears welling up in my eyes as I realized the very reasons why I chose to pledge.  My sisters.  My pledge sisters.  There's so much going on and there's so much happening, but with you guys here for me, I know that I'll be okay, I hope.  I have tears streaming down my face right now.  My family, I'm so sorry that I'm not there.  I wish with all of my heart that I could be there and show you guys how much I love you.  I do love you so much but right now..things are so tough.  I feel as though I am at my weakest physical point ever.  I'm so scared because I don't know the truth yet.  I don't know the future.  I can't even rely on myself.  Health-wise, I hate the situation that I am in right now.  I don't want to say anything but at the same time, I hate the inability that I'm feeling.
