Hmm..where should I begin?  Know love. Know happiness. No love. No happiness.  What can I say?  My dearest ladies, I am very happy for you..ps Jenn and ps Steenie and ps Mey(tco)...  I smile for you sisters.  You deserve the best and I am so happy to see you happy.  Hang in there..to all my buddies, best of luck on finals (and if you're already done or don't have finals, don't tell me..I still got five of them to take...got that?  Five of them) *hugz*  Anyway, other than that...If you never make mistakes or your heart never breaks, then youï¿½ll never know what true love takes.  And sometimes, ignorance is bliss.  Have you ever noticed that the worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you and yet you can never have them... when the moment you can't feel them under your fingertips you miss them?  Have you ever wondered which hurts the most... saying something and wishing you had not, or saying nothing and wishing you had?  I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say...  They are the things you get ashamed of because words diminish them; words shrink things that seemed timeless when they were in your head... to no more than living size when they are brought out...  Don't be afraid to tell someone you love him.  If you do, he might break your heart... but if you don't, you might break his.  Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?  Your heart decides who it likes and who it doesn't.  You can't tell your heart what to do.  It does it on its own when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.  Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay closed up because we are too afraid to care too much for the fear that the other person does not care as much, or at all.  Have you ever loved someone and they had absolutely no idea whatsoever?  Or fell for your best friend in the entire world, and then sat around and watch them fall for someone else?  Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?  We tell lies when we are afraid...afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.  But every time we tell a lie... the things we fear grows stronger Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump Don't be a person who has to look back & wonder what they would have or could have had.  No one waits forever..  Sometimes, I've realized that once you have loved someone, you can do anything for them.  Except love them the same way.  When do you begin to realize that it's time to stop fighting for what you believe in?  Do you ever stop fighting for what you want?  Or do you take a step back and realize that you're being selfish?  And maybe what you want isn't what the other person wants.  Maybe that other person wants to be let go of.  That other person wants you to stop fighting and you realize that you're just fighting the truth..you're fighting yourself.  Is that worth it?  What is worth it now?  I thought that I once knew.  But now?  I know that you cannot take anything for granted.  Nothing is for sure.  Nothing is definite.  The only true thing in this world is the Lord and that's it.  Just Him.  I miss my family and with everything going on, I wish that I could be there for them.  I miss Duy and I wish that I could be there for him, too.  I miss my friends back home and I wish that I could be there for them.  I miss my friends here and I wish that I could be there for them.  I wish for so much and I try but I've learned that I can only do so much.  And sometimes..you have to stop fighting and just give in.  Sometimes, you have to sacrifice in order to really realize what you had...
