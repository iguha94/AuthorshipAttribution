I saw you yesterday smiling and laughing through the pain. The sun was once shining, but now pours the heavy rain. But keep in constant mind the sun will rise again, A glorious rainbow will reappear And we'll forget about back then but keep you in our hearts forever and you'll live on and on We'll live lives to their fullest worth  [forwarded message]  this isn't the forward that I've been searching for, but it's just as important. If you have a forward that says something like, do you think a year is important, if not, then ask...but I know this is in there for sure, do you think an hour is important, if not, then ask two lovers waiting to meet...all I can remember is about the value of time....  Remember to always say what you mean. If you love someone, tell them. Don't be afraid to express yourself. Reach out and tell someone what they mean to you. Because when you decide that it is the right time,it might be too late. Seize the day. Carpe Diem. Never have regrets. Sometimes, you just have to either take the risk or the regret. And most importantly, stay close to your friends and family, for they have helped make you the person that you are today. Thank you guys so much...   Each life is a precious gift - a miracle, merging together of two wonderful people, Take it and live it. You only have one life . . . tell others that you love them; apreciate them; thank them...love them Oh, by the way, I love you for who you are.  Thank-you for being alive.  Thanx.
