Time is... money, or is not??         Imagine there is a bank which credits  your account each morning  with $86,400, carries over no balance from day to day, allows you to keep no cash balance, and every evening cancels whatever part of the amount you had failed to use during the day.  What would you do? Draw out every cent, of course!          Well, everyone has such a bank. Its name is time.         Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds. Every night it writes off, as lost, whatever of this you have failed to invest to good purpose. It carries over no balance. It allows no overdraft.  Each day it opens a new account for you. Each night it burns the records of the day. If you fail to use the day's deposits, the loss is yours.       There is no going back. There is no drawing against the "tomorrow".       You must live in the present on today's deposits. Invest it so as to get from it the upmost in health, happiness and success!          The clock is running. Make the most of today...          To realize the value of ONE YEAR       Ask a student who has failed his final exam.          To realize the value of ONE MONTH       Ask a mother who has given birth to a pre-mature baby.          To realize the value of ONE WEEK       Ask an editor of a weekly newspaper.          To realize the value of ONE DAY       Ask a daily wage laborer who has ten kids to feed.          To realize the value of ONE HOUR       Ask the lovers who are waiting to meet.          To realize the value of ONE MINUTE       Ask a person who has missed the train.          To realize the value of ONE SECOND       Ask a person who has survived an accident.          To realize the value of ONE MILLI-SECOND       Ask the person who has won a silver medal in the Olympics.          To find the value of ONE LIFETIME       Ask someone who missed their chance.          Treasure every moment that you have!          And treasure it more because you shared it with someone special...  Special enough to have your time... and remember, time waits for no one.         "We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give. "                                  ~     Winston Churchill
