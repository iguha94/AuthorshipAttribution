I don't know where to begin...  I was so scared yesterday morning when Joe's mother called.  My mind was all in a whirlwind.  I could barely stand up and I felt dizzy and lightheaded. The shock factor still hasn't worn off.  I don't know...I really don't know.  What a tragedy.  My heart and prayers go out to all that have been affected.  I hope that you and your loved ones are safe tonight...I can't really sleep.  To my east coast sisters, especially Maryam and Sheetal...what a close call; I'm glad that you ladies are okay.  *hugz*  To Tracy, I'm still praying...I wish that I could say 'don't be scared' but I can't because I'm scared, too...but I have faith that God is looking out for all of us.   Gloria and Issay, thank you for your support and kind words in my moment of fear and panic.  Edward Thomas Wong, you had me soooo scared.  When I heard your voice, I started crying and you know it, too.  Just so much shock and concern...    As for what's been affecting me here on the west coast, Joe, I wish that I could take away your headache; you've been this amazing source of support and friendship to me.  Yesterday's phone call scared me....how we were woken up to be told about the WTC tragedy...the whole day was torture trying to figure out what was going on..now, you're being put on stand-by by the marine corps.  I don't know how to respond..just trying to be here for you.  *hugz*  Much love and support to all....all I can do is keep praying...*hugz*
