I just need to vent.  Love is Sacrifice.  Always.... Sometimes, you care so much and sometimes, you have to let go.  Letting go is so hard...and sometimes, holding on is even harder.  When do you know when to let go and when to hold on?  No one can decide that but you.  Is it worth losing something incredible over something so small?  Or it is not so small and you're not being completely honest.  Sometimes, you'll look back and you'll regret what you did.  You'll regret how you never took that risk and tried to hold on.  Yeah, love is sacrifice but at the same time, it doesn't always mean to let go and sometimes you just have to learn it the hard way.  Just because love is sacrifice, it doesn't mean that you just give up.  That is not sacrifice.  Sacrifice is not giving up or quitting.  Sacrifice is an act out of love.  By giving up on someone...how is that an act out of love..it can be...but at the same time, you're not sacrificing.  You're being selfish and you're not willing to work things out.  You're not ready to truly sacrifice...  Sacrifice your pride.  Sacrifice your stubborn streak.  Sacrifice yourself to understand the other side.  Loving, knowing that you are going to get hurt is like living knowing that you are going to die.But not loving so you don't get hurt is like killing yourself before you die.  That is sacrifice.  Not giving up on something special.  That is not sacrifice when you did NOT even try...  Your destiny doesn�t pick you. You pick your destiny. Your destiny doesn�t come to you. You come to your destiny....is this the destiny that you want?  Because if it is, you better stop complaining.  Do not categorize anyone or judge anyone by a simple characteristic.  If you look at it from a third person point of view, she gave so much to you....she sacrificed so much for you.  She TRIED for you....she was honest and she was open.  She gave you everything that you asked for.  She put up with your ultimatums...and in the end, you did not respect her...her as a human being...her as being who she is...  She canNOT control how she is...how 'hyper-emotional' she is...that's just the way she is.  You told her once that you accepted her for who she was.  Emotions and all.    We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are....Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart ... Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside awakens....Destiny is not a matter of chance.   It is a matter of choice: it is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved..  Whatever you want to do. Do it now. There are only so many tomorrows...  Fate only takes you so far. Once you get there its up to you to make it happen..Mistakes are not intended to down us rather they make us stronger..Are you weak?  Because I see you as a coward..one who ran from something that he feared...unwilling and unable to accept his fears.  I believe...When you love a person, you are giving him the power to hurt you....Love is having to see more than what meets the eyes...You never lose by loving. You always lose by holding back...Trust takes years to build but only takes seconds to destroy it...�	How beautiful is friendship that turns into love, but how painful is love that turns into friendship....Sometimes we stare so long at the door that is closing that we see too late the door that is open...Love comes and love goes. But if it was meant to be. Eventually it will come back and for sure you�ll know..Just because someone doesn�t love you the way you want them to doesn�t mean they don�t love you with all they have...Always tell a guy how you feel because you never know if he feels the same or not. It�s better to know than to hold onto something that isn�t real...  The love in your heart wasn�t put there to stay because love isn�t love until you give it away!  The way to love anything is to realize it might be lost.-G.K. Chesterton Audi partem alteram.(Hear the other side)-St. Augustine  It's what you do unthinking that makes the quick tear start. The tear may be forgotten but the hurt stays in the heart  if you run away from everything that scares you in life . you'll be running forever..I'm learning..I'm learning not to run away...I'm learning to stand up and face it.  As much as it hurts, I'm trying...I'm trying not to run away...can you say the same?  When you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself.  What isn't in us doesn't disturb us..love never dies . it just changes..  until a man has found something to die for . he is not fit to live  If you never make mistakes or your heart never breaks, then you�ll never know what true love takes...you'll never realize what true love is until you hurt...�a journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step..if you keep on running away...you'll never realize the truth, and it may be a long path before you'll be truly happy, but it does take one step.  At the same time, I still believe that you're running scared and you don't want to handle the possibility that you could get hurt...it hurts to love someone and not to be loved in return . but the most painful thing is to love someone and never having the courage to let them know how you feel...�The only things in life that you regret are the risks that you never took...  Trouble is a part of your life, and if you don't share it, you don't give the person who loves you a chance to love you enough..  once again, i'm going to share this... Have you ever noticed that the worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you and yet you can never have them... when the moment you can't feel them under your fingertips you miss them?  Have you ever wondered which hurts the most... saying something and wishing you had not, or saying nothing and wishing you had?  I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say...  They are the things you get ashamed of because words diminish them; words shrink things that seemed timeless when they were in your head... to no more than living size when they are brought out...  Don't be afraid to tell someone you love him.  If you do, he might break your heart... but if you don't, you might break his.  Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?    Your heart decides who it likes and who it doesn't.  You can't tell your heart what to do.  It does it on its own when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.  Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay closed up because we are too afraid to care too much for the fear that the other person does not care as much, or at all.  Have you ever loved someone and they had absolutely no idea whatsoever?  Or fell for your best friend in the entire world, and then sat around and watch them fall for someone else?  Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?  We tell lies when we are afraid...afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.  But every time we tell a lie... the things we fear grows stronger   Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump.  Don't be a person who has to look back & wonder what they would have or could have had.  No one waits forever..  Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship...Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk..have you NOT learned anything from all of your accomplishments??  Or are you just scared to achieve a great love?  Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values..Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer and sometimes, there is a reason for the silence...don't be so quick to judge that silence...In disagreements with loved ones, deal only with the current situation.  Don't bring up the past....Remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds your need for each other..Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it.  Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than yours...Don't be afraid to love, you have the memories forever...You know you're in love when the same person who makes you so happy can make you so mad..The first duty of love is to listen...The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, it must be felt with the HEART..We are each of us angels with only one wing, and we can only fly by embracing one another...Love is not losing freedom, it is sharing freedom with another..Life is a journey, and love is what makes that journey worthwhile...To love is to place our happiness in the happiness of another...Love is an act of endless forgiveness, a tender look which becomes a habit   In the degree that we love will we be loved..
