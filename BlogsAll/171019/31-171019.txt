I still don't know where to go.  What can I say?  Eddie, just breathe...stop panicking and freaking out on me.  You shouldn't be so negative.  I don't know what else to say.  I admit that yes, I am scared.  And I will put everything else ahead of what I'm feeling.  I would rather deal with everything else than my own personal situations.  I would rather delve myself into work or school or anything else...as long as I don't have to deal with my personal sh*t.  I don't know how else to put it.  And in doing so, I fear that I will end up hurting people as I have done in the past.  I lag on dealing with my personal issues which does end up hurting people.  I care a great deal about this person.  When I am with this person, I'm always smiling...he's been there for me when I've needed him, but at the same time, my stupid fear comes along and I'm scared.  Maybe my actions seem like I'm pushing him away.  I fear hurting him, but I feel that I already have.  I can't be innocent again and just go along with things as if everything is okay.  I don't know how to describe it..  On the other hand, I'm so caught up in other stuff...that I want to care...but I find myself working myself doing so much other stuff that I'm so tired....
