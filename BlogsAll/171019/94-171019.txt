I can't explain it.  I just feel so damn drained.  I don't want to talk to anyone.  I don't want to see anyone.  My body feels like crap.  My mind feels even more like crap.  My stomach is growling but I'm too tired and too lazy to make myself any food.  I've been at work for 13+ hours.  And after seeing next semester's schedule - that doesn't make me feel any better at all.  It just makes me feel tired looking at it.  I don't know what happened.  I just feel like ...zilch.  I feel emotionally empty.  I feel mentally drained - so much that it hurts and I just have this pounding headache.  And physically?  Physically - lemme see - my joints hurt...it's raining again - at least, it's snowing like it was a couple of days ago...my shoulders and neck are cramping again and spasming.  I wish that I could go in for a treatment but I can't - I'm just so busy.  Busy busy busy.  Dang.  I'm trying not to cuss.  I'm really trying to be good.  You know how sometimes, you start acting more and more not like the way you used to be.  I know that it's a good thing to change and grow but some changes - I just don't like them about me.  I miss certain things about the old me.  But there are things that I knowt hat I've changed that are for the better.  But I miss how I was so much stronger back then in the sense that I could just do it without complaining and wihtout whining and without stressing.  I just handled it.  I used to excel.  I hate it when I don't excel - I hate it when I feel like I'm just doing average.  and life goes on.....
