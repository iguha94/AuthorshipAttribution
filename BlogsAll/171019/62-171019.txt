Okay...recap: Friday: CONGRATS to UCSB aKDPhi's Gamma class - Christine & Jessica headed off to Midway airport to meet up with Tessa and yvonne and we watched First Knight on our way to Houston...(pic coming soon)...got picked up by Michelle & Nette...at the hotel, we picked up Don and then, we went off to the Lambda/KDPhi mixer at the chinese buffet place...met up with Tammy..the alumnae felt old and weird when little 18 year old Lambdas tried to meet us.  Saw Julie & Danny (yay spring 2k1)..went back to the hotel - greasy Chinese food gave me a headache...met up with Kristin and Angela..they were starving and tired (luckily Kuan was able to help us find a food delivery place via the internet) and ordered some more food...but then, Ang's room was bombarded by Lambdas so she came over to crash...  Saturday: meetings...more meetings...business...business...brief intro into the actives meeting..more meetings and business...dinner at this delish South American place and they had yummy mojitos!!  :)  And then, bonding time with Nette and then, to this club called Go.  :-)  Spring 2k1 shots with Chihae and Don.  More drinks with National Board..heehee...and dancing around with Diana, SoCal KDPhis, UIC, Tessa, Petra, and everyone else...basically a very KDPhi filled weekend (no boys since I already have Kuan and everyone else seems to pale in comparison) but fun stuff...  Sunday: flying out...being soo freaking tired...meeting up with Chris, Frank, and Jon at Joy Yees and got them addicteed to the boba there..heehee...and then, off to Second City (but Donna with very little sleep...I started nodding off during the improv *sigh*) and then, back home..home sweet home  Today: woke up at 4ish in the morning to walk Frank and Jon to the blue line - thank goodness they made their flight!  Even tho Jon scared the crap out of me and forgot his wallet!  Anyway...now, I'm at work and then, I have class tonight from 6-9:30pm...*sigh*....I'm so tired.
