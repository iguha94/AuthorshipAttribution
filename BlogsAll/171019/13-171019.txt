Right now, I'm trying as hard as I can to focus on the important things in life: the things that are happening right now.  I'm trying to plan for this summer, but it's hard to.  Right now, I'm torn between staying here at UCSB or going to UCI for summer school.  It's a big decision and I cannot seem to make up my mind.  I guess that I should list the options for each one.  Living-wise: UCSB ~ I'd be an RC (Resident Coordinator) for the single student apartments which means that I have a 1bdrm apartment fully to myself, all utilities, phone, cable, everything paid for plus a $160/month stipend; UCI ~ I'd be living with my best friend, Cathy *^_^*  School-wise: UCSB ~ offering a deal of all units over 8 units are free!!!  Dude, I'm taking 15 units and only having to pay for 8 of them?  That's pretty tight...plus in addition to that, UCSB could possibly give me financial aid for those 8 units and oh, yeah, no registration fee at all since I'm already a Gaucho...  UCI ~ I'll be paying for the full 15 units and everything but at the same time, I can take Chinese with a friend plus that means that Duy and I can take that digital arts class together and we can also take ballroom dancing, too...  Work-wise: UCSB ~ found an internship for my minor in Professional Writing; UCI ~ I can do substitute teaching in Orange County  Social-wise: UCSB ~ all of my sisters won't be here :(  Most of my friends will be gone..have a few but not much...  UCI ~ Cathy will be there and Bryan and Jenn and Andrew and Ling and Chris and Stephen and DUY and Mark and Cianar and Justin and home will be soo much closer, too..  That's about all that I can think of right now but what choices..*SIGH*
