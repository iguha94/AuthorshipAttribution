Well, I woke up early - as usual but for some reason, I have no desire to brave the cold and go to work.  I don't know what it is but today is just not one of those days that I can just jump out of bed and can't wait to get the day started.  Today is another long day where I have class at the very end of work.  But this song came on and for some reason, I'm thinking of my boyfriend and how lately, I just haven't had the time for him.  I know that actions speak louder than words but it does make me sad...when on Thursday, we had a date.  We ate and came back to my place and passed out.  And then, yesterday - prime example.  We woke up early and went downstairs to watch morning cartoons and I made breakfast for us...and then, we went upstairs and we napped some more...went to his house...had lunch and then, I was reading and I fell asleep downstairs so I went upstairs and passed out in his bed...he joined me and we were asleep for a good 2-3 hours (man..and his parents weren't home then which could have meant *wink* but no, we were good and ASLEEP)...we watched the SUper Bowl and I fell asleep during it...I don't know why but I was sooo tired and last night, I went to bed at 2am - normal time and woke up early and now, I feel so blase.  *sigh*  and now to disappear this week...got another test this wednesday - I will resurface on Thursday after my test.
