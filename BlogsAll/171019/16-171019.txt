Where do I begin?  Bad news?  Good news?  Random thoughts...let's start from the bottom of that list.  You know when you meet someone and there's just something that intrigues you about that person that you almost want to go out of your way to get to know them?  Ehh..anyway, man..what a day!  I worked from 5:15 to 10am; went home and showered and then, went to a doctor's appointment at 11, had work from 12-1pm.  Then, I had a class and then, another class...where gosh...I biked like a madwoman home just to sit there and pump out a four page paper in 35 minutes where whether or not I get into English 106 depends on.  Gosh, I really want to get in..*fingers crossed*  Then, I went to Asian Am 142..have I told you how much I adore this professor?  He is sooo awesome!  Ambi is great.  This is the third quarter in a row that I'll be taking him.  I went to go contest my grade from last quarter when he pointed out that I received the highest grade in the class...*shrug* Alright, not complaining anymore.  Anyway, what I'm so psyched about is the huge play that I wrote last quarter for his playwrighting class...well, he's putting that into production and I get to direct my own play.  I'm so excited!!  To add onto that, for Playsia, I'll be acting in four plays and directing my own play.  I'm so excited about the whole situation!!  *^_^*  And all of you out there that can make it, I better see you there on June 4th when we put our final production out.  It's going to be so wonderful!!  Now, to the bad news...my godfather is dying of liver cancer.  Gosh, I dont' know what to say.  He treated me like one of his children.  Actually, he has three sons so I was like his daughter.  I don't know.  He did so much for my family back then.  I plan to go visit him.  He lives in Foster City, California.  If possible, please pray for him.  His name is Peter Lai.  Please pray for him...I'm going to go now because I've got tears in my eyes =o(
