I should be happy that it's Thursday and it's so close to the weekend but I'm feeling tired and blase.  I can't explain it - I just feel drained.  Yesterday was nice...I forgot about my Anatomy class...ehh...went home - got picked up by my boyfriend at the El stop so I didn't have to wait for the darned bus to take me home.  We dropped by the comic book shop..watched a bit of a Spanish movie and then, watch Bedazzled while I made ribs and corn for dinner - yeah, kinda lame but whatever - food is food....  Finished off the night with some studying, some time online, and chatting it up with my roommate, my biggie Leng.  I'm really going to miss her when I move out.  We've had some crazy times...heading to my old office to use the internet, "running" to the ice cream parlor - Margie's...running around Chicago ringing people's doorbells asking if we could see their place, moving in pains, late night talks, and always always EATING.  We've honestly seen each other through our bests and worst...I wish that I could say that we haven't seen each other through some of the worst times in our lives but we have.  She's been there for me when I felt like I failed kdphi and lost both my charter lils...and when I was hospitalized, she was there holding my hand and just overall, she's become like the closest friend to me here in Chicago besides Kuan - but it kinda makes sense that Kuan would be my best friend but she definately comes a close second.  *sigh*  I'm moving in three weeks...so crazy.  There's so much stuff to do.
