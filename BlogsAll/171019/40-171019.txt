I don't know where to even begin...    tornado...really worried about tim...  and then, there is   this link   Other than that, there is something that I need to blog about.  *sigh*  I think that I just made a decision that I know that I will look back upon and regret for the rest of my life.  Have you ever cared so much about someone but something inside of you was scared...and that fear enveloped all of you and made you so scared that you chose the chicken way out of things.  You chose to turn around and run away from your problems.  That's what happened to me.  I care so much about this person and want to be there for him.  I want to be patient and caring, but I'm scared.  Scared of getting hurt again.  I don't know what to think anymore.  It is true.  Sometimes, it isn't the person that hurt you the most that you end up regretting.  It is the person that you let go because you were scared, too scared to be with them.  I don't know.  I feel selfish though and I feel like a huge dork.  I keep on telling myself that I'm not going to cry and I bite back my tongue and try...I try to hold back my tears.  I don't know...I don't know if I can keep on talking/writing without wanting to cry some more..
