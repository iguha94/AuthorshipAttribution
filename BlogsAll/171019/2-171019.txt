I'm so tired.  I'm still tired.  And I'm stupid.  I'm stupid because I overworked my body.  I've pushed my body to a point where it's just giving up right now.  The whole day has been revolving around my two papers.  I turned in the first one and that seemed to be okay..I haven't touched Vivarin in the longest time just because I didn't want to end up addicted to them as I was in junior high.  All of yesterday and the day before, I was just surviving off of pure necessity that I had to stay awake.  It was imperative for me to finish off my papers.  Anyway, so the whole day passed until 4pm and I was just rush rush rush..all panicky.  I stopped for a good half an hour to sit there and pray.  I prayed and I prayed for those close to me.  I prayed for enlightenment.  I prayed for strength.  And I praised God for being alive.  I praised him for allowing me to feel things.  I praised for allowing me to cry when I needed to cry.  And I prayed for His guidance.  I was working on my second paper when my body just gave up and I fell asleep and missed turning it in.  *fudge*  I realized that 72 hours of no sleep is a bad thing.  *sigh*  So, I'm just kinda screwed over right now.  I'm so tired..two more weeks and then, I'm going to be on my way to Chicago.  Home sweet home!  Anyway...I'm going to go study some and go to bed soon since I do have work super early tomorrow..
