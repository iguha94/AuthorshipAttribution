Well..I need to get into this one program and L. and R. are both using it.  R. is incredibly  busy and L. is just shooting random info around and managing to just annoy me.  I'm sleepy and tired and just want to go home but I have this 6pm appointment.  WtF is wrong with me - I should just call her and be like, I can't do it.  Argh!  Man, what a night this is going to be.....  L. has managed to work my last nerve today.  He was so unprepared for his meeting this morning - I ended up typing up the agendas and I ended up doing the minutes because if i didn't, it just wouldn't get freaking done.  I feel like my day has been very packed.  I had a total of a whopping four appointments today not including my 6pm one.  Hence, it's looking to be a very very busy week for me.  Tomorrow, I have four appointments and Thursday, I have four in addition to some meetings, too.  *sigh*  Damn L.  He cracks these STUPID jokes that no one else finds funny.  I need to really ignore him because he's starting to get on my nerves AGAIN.  He hasn't had any appointments in the past two weeks except for the one appointment that I couldn't make so I asked him to take over her appt instead.  Honestly...how can he be my supervisor when he acts so incompetent and he's so lazy...I need a leader to follow by example.  Having him around makes me frustrated and makes me want to be lazy and stuff, too.  *sigh*
