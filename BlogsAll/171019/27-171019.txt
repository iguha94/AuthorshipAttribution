For those of you in Love, or getting out of Love, here`s something to think about:   One of the most valuable truths in love is that you never know that you will find around he next corner. Try as we may to understand the peaks and valleys of romance, it seems that as humans, we inevitably end up scratching our heads. Fortunately, there is always hope and a deeper truth to be found in love`s game. I think Woody Allen put`s it best when he wrote,� The heart is a very resilient little muscle.� I have often wondered where our souls fit into this grand plan. Many have asked me, over the years, to define the term `soul mate". Defining this word coupling proves itself a difficult task. Most people`s understanding of this concept relates to their belief that in life, we all have one "true love". I have heard many people say they are seeking their "other half". Artists and poets alike have brought illumination to the subject through literature and songs. Indeed,  throughout the history of humankind, lies an inexhaustible fascination with the mysteries of the soul. Fate plays a big role in the hand of love as we search for connection, familiarity and destiny. We all seek a love that is "meant to be". According to karmic traditions, a soul mate is someone we have known in a previous lifetime. Our friends in the present are companions from the past. In Hindu traditions, karma is interwoven with the relationships and experiences you have with people in your life. Following this formula, our souls evolve each time we learn a lesson. If we act with good conscience and truth, we will come back in our next lifetime on a greater spiritual plane. (Our purpose here on earth is positive work and giving of ourselves to others because we  won`t get another chance to do so, not because we want to earn a brownie or two. Reincarnation is a pile of *bleep*.) Yet, theology is not a defining factor because in the global community, we all embrace different traditions and teachings. The universal truth is thatwe all seek love by joining with others, bringing along our individuality and  our uniqueness.  I have fallen in love a few times, finding only one certainty:  - Love is an inextinguishable force. It arrives when it wants and departs  when it pleases.  - Love manifests itself in every unique and wonderful possibility.  The perplexity lies in recognizing love, finding the real thing. Finding a connection with another is not difficult if your heart is open. The "knowing" is the hard part. In life and in spirit, hope springs eternal and love must be part of that. Considering our fantasies and longings, we need to believe in the mystery of companionship and eternal love. There is no doubt in mind that in order to find love, we must first believe in love. It is always  faith, which delivers the answers. Hope springs eternal when we meet someone with whom we find that connection. A sense of wholeness abounds as we sail on the ship of love, destiny being our ocean. Through years of personal exploration, I have grown to believe that soul mates are about more than the heart. I believe that a soul mate is any person who enters our lives with greater meaning and purpose. Our souls evolve through loving others. Our lives evolve through the paths we choose. What counts in life and in love is the ability to know individual truth. If you make love your journey, finding your soul mate will be the destination
