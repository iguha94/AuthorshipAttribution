It was always a hot summer  In the days we used to play  I could say it doesn't matter  But I'd give me all away  Now an autumn has passed and another one, too,  There will be many springs now,  All without you.  Our California winters won't see you again  And neither will I  Till my seasons will end  What hurts selfish me is not that you've gone,  But that I am still here,  And I'm all alone.  Spring, winter, fall run into each other  I hope where you are it is one endless summer.  In our hearts forever . . . till the end of time.  Waiting for the time we will be together again.   "Heaven's Tears" tonight, as the rain pours, drops fall from my eyes, selfishly missing you, it seems as though the heavens cry, the earthly loss of one so treasured, but the celestial gain of a precious soul Denial runs its course thru my mind; A knot clogged in my throat, strangling my cries and screams, Knowing but not fully accepting, the fact that you're gone: yesterday so beautiful, youthful, and vibrant, today - no longer here. I know the sun will rise and keep on shining through dismal clouds As a ray breaks past the gloom, I feel your presence and warmth; Living Forever and ever until the end of Time in our hearts and memories.
