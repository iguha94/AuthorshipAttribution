Okay, I'm going to try to write more just because I realize that this past summer has been my Internet off time and I hella miss it!!  *^_^*  heehee...I can hardly wait to go back to Santa Ynez but at the same time, I really like Garden Courts, too.  This weekend has been an interesting one so far.  One word for now.  Genevive.  No further explanations though.  Other than that, Jin, babe, thank you soooo much for everything...for being there for me and for helping me undergo a makeover.  heehee...I can't really explain it, but this weekend was the weekend of all weekends for physical change.  I felt that I needed to change something so I decided to go for my physical appearance.  Really trippy thought actually.  Jin kept on saying all of last night how I would be the last person to ever dye my hair since I have 'virgin' hair....never dyed before.  And then, just a different makeup style...=oï¿½  I don't know why but I needed to do something different and drastic...can't really explain it.  Other than that, we met up with Karyn, a Baylor University alum, akdphi charter, baybee!!  *^_^*  And we got a little taste of Lambda Phi Epsilon etiquette.  *^_^*  heeheee...Karyn, it was great meeting you and your bf ~ hope that your date went well and you two had fun...have a safe drive back to Texas!  *^_^*
