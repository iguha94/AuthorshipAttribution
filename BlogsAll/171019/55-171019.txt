Each one of us hides an awful secret.  Buried deep within every human soul throbs a muted pain that never goes away.  It is a lifelong yearning for that one love that will never be found, the languishing in our selves for an all-consuming intensity of intimacy that we know will never be fulfilled, a heart-need to surrender all tat we are to a bond that will never fail.  The silent churning at the core of our beings is the tormenting need to know and to be known, to understand and to be understood, to posses and to be possessed, to belong unconditionally and forever without fear of loss, betrayal or rejection.   Nothing is inherently annoying, yet you can choose to be annoyed by just about anything. Similarly, no situation is inherently embarrassing, or stressful, or frustrating. Embarrassment, stress, and frustration are some of the many ways in which you can choose to respond.  Keep in mind that your response to any situation is always your choice. After all, it`s you doing the responding. And it is in you best interest to choose wisely. Those who consistently respond with anger or envy, annoyance or frustration will reap the bitter rewards of those bitter responses. Yet when you choose to respond with understanding, with patience, with confidence and courage, the rewards will be far sweeter.   The situation does not determine the response. You determine your response. In every moment, in every circumstance, you can choose the response that will move your life positively forward. As such, nothing can bring you down unless you choose to be brought down. Nothing can annoy you, or frustrate you, or keep you dismayed.   You always have the choice to respond in the best and most positive way. Each time you choose your own positive, creative, empowering response, whatever the situation may be, you move yourself and the whole world forward.   -- Ralph Marston
