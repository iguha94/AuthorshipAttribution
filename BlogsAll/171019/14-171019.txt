Hello world!!  *^_^*  I am FINALLY home to my baby and back from Chi-town.  What can I say about my trip?  Andrew, Gina, Kristine, and Lisa ~ OMG...I missed you all soooo much!!!  *HUgz*  To all of those that I could not visit, I am sooo sorry but maybe another time.  This time I was just limited in everything ~ time, mileage, energy, etc...I'm so sorry.  To Duy, thank you.  Thank you for putting up with me and my no sense of direction, my bad map reading skills (skills?  what skills?  exactly...), my inconsiderate lack of common sense, my absentmindedness, and just everything else!!  THANK YOU...*hugz*  Andrew ~ thank you for being so understanding and great.  I wish that we could have gone to church together and bonded through our common love of Christ.  But I guess lunch will do, huh?   *smilez*  Gina aka GiGi aka Georgie aka Silver aka G-Dawg..heehee...omg...thank you sooo much for everything from the 'steak and beer' for Duy and the 'authentic Viet cusine' even though you had the Thai pad thai.  *winks*  I had fun going to your English class and I hope that Professor Katz does NOT remember me..gosh, how embarrassing...I got caught falling asleep in a classroom thousands of miles away from my own school.  Oh, yeah, Gina, please thank Katie again for me.  Kris aka Marvie, babe, hope that your studies are going well..I'm sorry that we didn't get a chance to hang out more...and sorry about what happened...  And last but definately not the least, Lisa, babe, I LUV you!!!  Dude, the tears in your eyes made me start bawling.  I can't get over the similarities between Don and Duy and their whole 'you have no reason and logic!!'  heehee...man, you had Duy busting up over the whole comparison thing the next morning.  *hugz*  Besides these shoutouts to my buddies, i'll talk more about the trip later but I'm really pooped right now.  I was going to take another bus back to Isla Vista, but screw that...I ended up taking a taxi instead.  Now, I'm just beyond pooped. *bleah*  I'll write more later...*promise*
