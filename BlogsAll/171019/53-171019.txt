"Life will only come once, so make the most out of it." God didn't give us all things to enjoy life, but life to enjoy all things Mistakes are not intended to down us rather they make us stronger Each friend represents a world in us, a world not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born God might not always answer you when you call. But whenever you need him he�s always on time  God promises skies. But he doesn�t promise they�ll always be blue When you have nothing left to say. Nothing left to do. Cry on.
