What a weekend.  It is not even over.  Where do I even begin?  Our presentations were this Friday and oh goodness, thank you to all those that were there.  Thank you for coming all the way out to Santa Barbara, especially to those who traveled a long and arduous road battling traffic and the rain.  Thank you, my Big Sis...*hugz*  You spoiled me rotten with your gifts.  Thank you, my p.sisters and as I stood alongside you, I was fighting back tears of pride and tears of joy and tears of amazement.  I broke down crying a few times that night.  I don't know what I would have done without you by my side.  You were my strength that fueled me and kept me going.  All of Friday was spent with you and you alone know how precious that means to me.  But seriously, thank you to everyone that showed up.  I was a little intimidated and shocked and surprised to see so many people show up.  It meant alot.  It was a pretty big deal and to see so many lovely ladies touched me.  When I spoke my words, my heart was bursting with emotion and nervousness.  Other than that, Milton, thank you.  Thank you for coming down to visit me this weekend.  It meant alot to see you and spend time with you.  Thank you for being there for me and listening to me rant and rave.  I can only wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and hope that all goes well for you.  Two words for you Milton: Interesting and amazing.  You and your hella nor cal slang.  =oï¿½  Anyway, though, it really touched me that you would come all this way down to spend some time with me and I hope that you have a safe ride back up.  I enjoyed spending time with you and I guess that I'll see you again before the end of the quarter.  If I can't come up for that one weekend, then, I'll be seeing you once we're done.  *hugz*  Take care..  Well, I need to get going now to Church..Palm Sunday.  *^_^*  Other than that, I'll be volunteering at the Special Olympics and then, meetings afterwards and sometime, I need to find time to write up that four page paper for Ambi's class and the eight page paper for Prof. Corum's class, too..*sigh*
