Man...Leo pointed out how I have begun nearly all of my blogs with "I'm so tired" ~ He said that I should go get some rest and I couldn't agree more, but I can't.  I don't have the time!!  And it's my fault that I don't have the time.  I can hardly wait.  Two more weeks and then, I'll be back in Chicago.  Chi-town ~ home sweet home...man, I get tears in my eyes.  I guess that I'm just a sappy emotional person.  I cry when I tell my mother and father that I love them.  I sniffle when I tell my siblings that I love them.  I get tears in my eyes when I look at pix of me and my p.sisters.  *^_^*  They make me smile and cry at the same time.  I'm telling you, in May, I'm going to be bawling once it happens.  We've been through so much together, babes.  No eye makeup for me that night because it's all gonna smear!!  I'm totally looking forward to tonight and volunteering tomorrow at the Special Olympics.  I'm getting tears in my eyes right now just typing this.  Other than everything else...the situation with my grandparents just isn't getting much better.  They never change and maybe, it is because they're old-fashioned and traditional, but it's not really fair to me that they're still judging me based on my gender and how I'm just automatically wrong.  It's not fair but I'm not one to judge them or anyone else for that matter.  That's the Lord's job and He will punish and He will uphold those in His Name.  *sigh*  Just thinking about how great He is makes me smile.
