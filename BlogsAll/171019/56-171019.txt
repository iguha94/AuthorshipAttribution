On a lonely night when the cold wind blows in the window,  I want to warm my frozen heart,  replaying that summer.  You look so happy playing on the beach,  A video of memories of just the two of us,  I view alone.  While feeling a little shy  I murmured "I love you",  your lying face is blurry  with the color of my tears.  I`m miserable over you! Sorry, but this way,  even now, I`m leaving behind my feelings.  If everything about us is in this light,  Can I still rewind, to that day?   Both hands full of memories I had believed,  I count them again and again, and yet  I get no further than my little finger.  Please be by my side, say "It`s not true!",  and embrace my heart.  If everything about us has disappeared,  Right now I want to rewind, to that day.   "We all want to fall in LOVE. Why? Because that experience makes us feel completely alive...Where every sense is heightened, every emotion is magnified, our every day reality is shattered and we are flying into the heavens. It may only last a moment, an hour, an afternoon. But that doesn't`t diminish its value. Because we are left with memories that we treasure for the rest of our lives." -Unknown   Some people come into our lives and quickly go. Some stay for a while and leave footprints in our hearts. And we are never, ever the same."   "The path of life has many crossroads, and at each one it`s difficult to say goodbye and go our own separate ways, choosing the direction that is right for each of us. But the memory of being together will always remain, and there is always the chance that our paths will cross again."   "The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart."   "We all take different paths in life, but no matter where we go, we take a little of each other everywhere."   I would like a simple life  yet all night I am laying  poems away in a long box.   --Anne Sexton   This is the hardest thing of all: to close the open hand out of love,  and keep modest as a giver.   --Nietzsche        "When you know the universal language, it's easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, whether it's in the middle of the desert or in some great city. And when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant. There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. Without such love, one's dreams would have no meaning." -Paulo Coelho         Be more concerned about your character  Than your reputation because your  Character is who you are and your  Reputation is what others think of you   �*:�.People are going to talk about you  Especially when they envy you  And the life you lived  Let them..  You affected their lives  They didn`t affect yours...�:*   Each new day is a blank page in the diary of your life.  The secret of success is in turning that diary into the best story you possibly can. Have pages on understanding and tales of overcoming hardships. Fill your story with enthusiasm, adventure, learning, and laughter. And make each chapter reflect time doing these things:  Follow your dreams. Work hard. Be kind. Do what you can to make the door open on a day that is filled with inspiration in some special way. Remember: Goodness will be rewarded. Smiles will pay you back. Have fun.  Find strength. Be truthful. Have faith. Don`t focus on anything you lack.  Realize that people are the treasures in life, and happiness is the real wealth. Have a diary that describes how you`re doing your best, and... the rest will take care of itself.  To The Friend I wish I had   I wish you saw me I as I wish I were  I made my mistakes As you did too  Though forgiveness is hard to give  I gave you the world with life  The pure gold of richness  In return you gave me sorrow  I see many obstacles to overcome  One so many that you are needed  Trying so much to have you here  You tend to disappear like thin air  Like the stars up above  You tend to be lost and bright  As I may run to find the light  You stand there watching me  Running and turning I fail  I fail to be guided towards you  I made my wrongs moving further  Further and further you get dim  Dimmer and Dimmer you are to me  As life is now starting a new  Though the precious gifts we receive  I shall cherish forever  So as you the lost friend  I shall one day go in search  Searching for a new path  Trying to head on back to your light  Of the friendship we once had  Til the end of day I shall know  I shall always know you are there  Somewhere in the skies  In search of a friend like me  Til we meet once again
