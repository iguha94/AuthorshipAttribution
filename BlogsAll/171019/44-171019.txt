Okay, enough of my silly ramblings and stories and poetry...  I want to share about my weekend.  *^_^*  Where should I begin?  To my e-board, I luv you guys and I luv how we hang out and discuss everything.  I think that it's wonderful *wink*  To my pledge bro, Matt, thank you...heehee..I know, you had to put up with 12 hours of me on the train to San Diego.  But it was definately worthwhile.  We now know who dominates in Big Two and we both had a good 'active' weekend.  *smilez*  I went to an exchange with the UCSD aKDPhi and the UCSD PAPhi.  Dwight, I know that I was supposed to chill with you and have a few beers, but I ended up hanging out with the girlies instead..sowee!  But Paula is so kick-@$$ and the girls are so great to be around...I kinda couldn't help it.  I just wanted to wish the Rho Pledge Class best of luck and much love...I hope to see you all on other side!  Despite everything, oh, yeah, Faustine and Kathy, thank you for keeping me company..but I have to admit one of the best parts of the evening was Stephanie's sudden surprise cop entrance.  =oï¿½  Saturday's UCSD PAPhi Alpha/Beta Class Installs was definately something sweet.. Once again, congrats to you all...to my Big Bro, Arthur, *HUGZ*  Hope that you liked all of your gifts...I know that it's not much but just remember..it is the thought that counts!  And to Robert, my West H.S. buddy...we'll be talking later..but *HUGZ* thank you sooo much for going all to LA for a favor of mine.  In addition to that, hope that you like your gifts and put it to some good use...thanx for dropping me off at the salon to get my hair done, too.  heehee...we're such brats when we're together...from attacking each other..you know that I didn't beat yo sorry @$$ so you would still have some face in front of Lisa.  *^_^*  Oh, and thanx for the lil' mention of me in your program..it's nice to know that I talk so much on my cell phone that I'm going to give other ppl brain cancer..And thanx for taking the picture with me on your back.  I hope that you and your bros liked the 'pineapples' that we made for you guys.    thank you again to the ucsd kdphis for helping me out cuz there is no way in heck that i could have passed out gifts to all the guys and made it look all smooth and shiz.  Annie..my pledge sis and my president..heehee..you're so awesome!  I felt so much better once I saw you.  There's always something about a pledge sister, especially you, Bookworm!  Thank you for representing UCSB with me.  Last but definately not the least, Dwight, thank you for asking me to be your date.  I truly enjoyed the whole weekend.  It was very relaxing and if anything, it was exactly what I needed.  Like we both said last night, this weekend took us both by surprise and it was very nice.  Heehee..thank you very much for picking my pledge bro and myself from the station..thanx for the beer *wink* and thanx for being so hospitable...thank you for my puppy..once i get him back today, i'll figure out where i'm gonna put him...hope that you liked your gift..even though you already have so many letters *sigh*...thanx for the boba fix..ask robert, he knows how much i crave my boba after being in sb for so long!...thanx for picking me up from the salon...and heehee..thanx for not laughing at me when i wanted to run from the pledges because they scared me by rushing me..heehee...thanx for listening to my cheesy jokes..especially the one about the elephant in the safeway....haha...LOL!...thanx for putting up with my headache throughout installs and then, me ditching you once it came to open presentations..putting up with me running out on you right before i escorted you out...man, i can't get over how she had me going and so scared for a moment there...heehee....i got you out on the dance floor!  heehee...thanx for the dance..and omg..thank you soo much for taking care of me saturday night and what a brat i was to you...*blah*  i can't believe that you put up with it..thank you...and thank you, above all, for all the time that you put into making my weekend as wonderful as it was.  i truly will treasure it.
