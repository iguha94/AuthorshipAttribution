Oh, gosh, I feel so tired.  Leo was right.  I always do start off most of my blogs complaining about how tired I am.  And Pat, you were right.  Me giving up whining for Lent is like you giving up swearing.  It's not plausible.  Anyway, this quarter...is definately going to be something.  My classes?  There isn't a single one that I don't enjoy.  Man...that means that I'll be going to all of them.  I have the same professor for two of the classes which is pretty cool.  Professor Corum for my creative writing class..oh, gosh, even though I have an 8 page paper due on Monday, I get excited writing the paper.  I'm nearly down with my paper already.  Crazy stuff, huh?  And then, Professor Waid?  Gosh, I never thought that I could enjoy Twain as much as she put it into perspective.  *^_^*  She truly makes American literature interesting and enjoyable just by throwing in perverse points in Twain's writing.  Ambi...what can I say more about him?  I've purposely taken a class with him every quarter this year.  He's so great.  He's the one who wrote me every single one of my internships from the one in Illinois to the one at UC Berkeley.  He's great.  And I totally look forward to putting on Playsia and seeing my production take form.  It's going to be exciting.  So, school is good....  Work, on the other hand...gosh, if I didn't need the money so badly and if the family was doing better, I wouldn't be worrying about it.  I'd just want to take this quarter off of work.  I don't know.  I used to enjoy working but right now, I know that this sounds stupid, but I kinda just want to concentrate on school.  I want to concentrate on my tests for graduate school.  I want to be able to have the time to pick up the internships for my major.  I wish that money wasn't a factor.  I don't know.  I still have my health bills to pay off, my medical loans, and to top it all off, there's so much crap happening with the family that I have this obligation and desire to help out as much as I can.  I know that I came out of the beginning of this quarter with an extra two thousand, but Duy, don't get mad at me...I loaned my mother all of that.  I know that I could have used that money otherwise, but what can I say?  My family has given me so much and the least I can do is help out when I can.  My sisters...I love you so much!  There's so much crap happening from my medical condition and fears to my work-related problems and other personal things...but seriously, when I am with all of my lovely ladies, I start smiling...or through the worst of it and when we're stressing out together, I feel more comfortable knowing that I'm not alone.  I'm never alone with my p.sisters.  *hugz*  Being with you is like being in a separate entity where all my other problems cannot touch me.  To my friends, thank you so much for being so understanding and supportive.  The Lord truly blessed me with kindred spirits like you guys.  To the divas, truly and forever I have been grateful for divas like you two.  I look forward to Florida, Teeners and Cats, I promise that I'll try to come down and visit with you.  This summer will be one to remember.
