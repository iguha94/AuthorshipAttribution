$20 Bill- A well-known speaker started off  his seminar by holding up a $20.00 bill. In the room of 200, he asked,  "Who would like this $20 bill?"  Hands started going up.     He said, "I am going to give this  $20 to one of you but first, let me do this."     He proceeded to crumple up the $20 dollar bill.    He then asked, "Who still wants  it?"  Still the hands were up in the air.     "Well," he replied, "What if I do  this?"      And he dropped it on the ground and started to grind  it into the floor with his shoe.     He picked it up, now crumpled and  dirty.     "Now, who still wants it?" Still the hands went into the air.    xXdExtEr4mEEhXx (11:05:22 PM): "My friends, we have all learned a  very valuable lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still  wanted it because it did not decrease in value.     It was still worth  $20.      Many times in our lives, we are dropped,  crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way.     We feel as though we are  worthless.      But no matter what has happened or what will happen,  you will never lose your value.     Dirty or clean, crumpled or finely  creased, you are still priceless to those who DO LOVE you.     The worth of our lives comes not in what we do or who we know, but by WHO WE  ARE.     You are special - Don't EVER  forget it."
