Oh, goodness...I don't know where to begin.  Right now, I'm so tired of everything.  I'm struggling deep inside to find the strength to continue carrying on.  Sometimes, I wish that my life could go back to normality instead of worrying about mindless things that I do worry about.  I'm really looking forward to seeing my sisters tonight.  They manage to make me smile.  I don't know how but they do.  When I'm with them, I feel a lighter load upon my shoulders.  I'm also really looking forward to AACF this Wednesday.  I really need it.  I can't fully explain it but I need it.  I need the fellowship and I need the sweet release.  I'm determined this quarter to bring up my grades.  I mean, seriously, I didn't do that bad last quarter but I didn't exactly ace last quarter.  It was so hard..and I brought in mostly B's which isn't satisfactory for the honors program.  I don't really want to go into detail about what's wrong right now but I'm sure that God does everything in my life for a reason.  I just pray that I'm strong enough and I pray for strength to be stronger.  I worry about my family so much and I wish that I could be with them right now but at the same time, I don't know if I could handle everything, too.  *sigh*  I'm just so tired right now and sleepy.  I was up until 2am but I had work at 5:15am...and I'll be out tonight until midnight with classes until 8pm and other things going on, as well..I don't know..I'm going to stop whining and go back to unpacking from my norcal trip.  Oh, yeah!  To the UCSC aKDphi, thank you for everything and your hospitality.  The brief time that I spent in the glow of your sisterhood is inspiration enough and I hope that my sisters and I can grow as close you all are with each other.
