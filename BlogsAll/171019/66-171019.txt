Again, I'm annoyed at L.  I don't know how he manages to piss me off sooo freaking much!  I'm in the middle of interviewing a quality student who is taking A LOT of energy out of me...and her appointment with me started at 10am...and just ended - right now, it's freaking 12:30pm and I'm STARVING but no...I have to interview another student because L. sucked up an hour of my freaking time.  We're busy talking and I'm answering questions and L. shows up and is like "so, I was wondering if you'd be interested and blah blah blah" and L. starts talking about all this bullsh*t and starts to drone on and on and to be honest, I'm really sick of hearing about his past and his background.  Honestly - all that bullsh*t can be summarized in two minutes instead of freaking 20 minutes.  It really pisses me off.  L. is sad and pathetic.  L.  has no life outside of his wife and what he can call "work".  He doesn't do any work.  When was the last time that he had an appointment.  He hasn't done anything for our upcoming open house.  L. just annoys me because he just complains and complains and talks way too much about irrevelant bullsh*t.  If there was anything that I have to complain about this job is just L.  I despise the fact that he was suddenly made my supervisor after 1.5 months of him being my equal because he complained too much.  I despise the fact that I work longer and harder than him and yet he tries to take the credit...did I mention how he has been trying hard to steal students from me....bastard.  I'm off to another appointment and hungry as heck.  :(
