I don't know if this will work but it is worth a shot.. Happy aKDPhi Founders Day! Happy 24th Birthday to my boyfriend!  :-)  It all started on Thursday when I took him out to dinner to Heaven on Seven and Friday, off to Purdue for some bday celebrating...and now, I'm at his place for some family bday cake and stuff. ::Edit::  I guess that he's not taking me home tonight cuz he's tired..that's what old age will do to you.  It's kinda interesting..I was talking to someone and I realized that my mother has had a stronger effect on me than I realized.  My mom is a whopping six months (exactly) older than my dad and all the while growing up, she always said "Never date anyone younger than you...even your own age is stretching it"  hence I've never had a boyfriend younger than me...and rarely have I ever dated a guy that was even my own age.  And it seems that way with Kuan cuz I'm always stretching his age.  Before his birthday, when people asked me how old he was, I'd be like "Oh, he's almost 24...."  heehee...now, I can say that "Oh, he's almost 25"...maybe it's just me being weird. ::Another edit:: Random trip to Purdue..my grand lil and me at BW3 for wings..(hey Venus...we look really tired :-P )   NU party at Las Palmas     And then, the bday celebration in Purdue..first of all, look how innocent he used to be...AWWW...and then, now..    And then, Yugo LICKED my boyfriend...   Then, the Purdue KDPhis and me (the two Dianas, Miss Iron Chef, my grand lil and me - dang, my grand lil is so red!)         Cindy and me - a year later we take a picture together...except this time, you're hiding behind me again!   And then, time for some couple pictures..heehee...Kuan and me looking normal and then, our regular goofy selves and then, my grand lil and her birthday boyfriend         and then...the results on Saturday morning..     And then, the "normal" family bday celebration :-P hope that you liked your gift, hon!  ;-)  His sister, brother, and I teamed up and got him a digital camera :-)
