A Mom is driving a little girl to her friend's house for a play date.   "Mommy," the little girl asks, "how old are you?"   The mother looks over at the little girl and says, "Honey, you are not supposed to ask a lady her age, it isn't polite," the mother warns.   "Okay," the little girl says, "how much do you weigh?"   "Now really," the mother says, "these are personal questions that are really none of your business."   Undaunted, the little girl asks, "Why did you and daddy get a divorce?"   "Enough questions now, honestly!" The exasperated mother walks away as the two friends begin to play.   "My mom wouldn't tell me anything," the little girl says to her friend.   "Well," says the friend, "all you need to do is look at her driver's license. It's like a report card, it has everything on it."   Later that night the little girl says to her mother, "I know how old you are, you are 32."   The mother is surprised and asks, "How did you find that out?"   "I also know that you weigh 140 pounds."   The mother is past surprise and shock now. "How in heaven's name did you find that out?"   The little girl continues on triumphantly, "And... I know why you and daddy got divorced."   "Oh really?" the mother asks, "why is that?"   The girl replies, "Because you got an F in sex.
