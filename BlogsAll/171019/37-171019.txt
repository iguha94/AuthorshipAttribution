I wrote this three years ago and I still go back and remember the reasons behind it... Have you ever noticed that the worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you and yet you can never have them... when the moment you can't feel them under your fingertips you miss them?  Have you ever wondered which hurts the most... saying something and wishing you had not, or saying nothing and wishing you had?  I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say...  They are the things you get ashamed of because words diminish them; words shrink things that seemed timeless when they were in your head... to no more than living size when they are brought out...    Don't be afraid to tell someone you love him.  If you do, he might break your heart... but if you don't, you might break his.  Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?  Your heart decides who it likes and who it doesn't.  You can't tell your heart what to do.  It does it on its own when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.  Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay closed up because we are too afraid to care too much for the fear that the other person does not care as much, or at all.  Have you ever loved someone and they had absolutely no idea whatsoever?  Or fell for your best friend in the entire world, and then sat around and watch them fall for someone else?  Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?    We tell lies when we are afraid...afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.  But every time we tell a lie... the things we fear grows stronger Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump Don't be a person who has to look back & wonder what they would have or could have had.  No one waits forever..   All of this makes me think back and I want to share a few quotes with you... 	I love you and not---not in a friendly way, although I think we're great friends. And not in a misplaced affection, puppy dog way, although I'm sure that's what you�ll call it. I love you. Very simple. Very truly. You are the---the epitome of everything I've ever looked for in another human being. And I know you think of me as just a friend and crossing that line is--is the furthest thing from an option you would ever consider but, huh, I had to say it. I just--I can't take this anymore. I can't stand next to you without wanting to hold you. I can't--I can't look into your eyes without feeling that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels. I can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are ... there isn't another soul on this fucking planet who has ever made me half the person I am when I'm with you."     Holden, Chasing Amy (I loved this part of the movie..*sigh*) - Love is when you care for someone even if there were no emotions. Passion or romance involved. You just love the person for who they are. Without that you would never know what true love is - Immature love says " I love you because I need you " but mature love says " I need you because I love you " - One of life�s disappointments includes meeting someone that meansthe world to you. But only to find that in the end it was never meant to be and you just have to let go �Letting go of someone you love is the hardest thing to do. It�s going to hurt and you�ll lose that someone but you�ll never lose your love for him or her. That love is endless �How beautiful is friendship that turns into love, but how painful is love that turns into friendship... �If it feels so good to love the wrong person, imagine how it would feel to love the right one. �Just because someone doesn�t love you the way you want them to doesn�t mean they don�t love you with all they have �Always tell a guy how you feel because you never know if he feels the same or not. It�s better to know than to hold onto something that isn�t real �Don�t cry because it�s over. Smile because it happened �if you run away from everything that scares you in life, youll be running forever �some things are better left unsaid �If you never make mistakes or your heart never breaks, then you�ll never know what true love takes �a journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step - Lao tzu � it hurts to love someone and not to be loved in return . but the most painful thing is to love someone and never having the courage to let them know how you feel �The only things in life that you regret are the risks that you never took  - Grumpy Old Men �Trouble is a part of your life, and if you don't share it, you don't give the person who loves you a chance to love you enough. - Never frown even if you are upset or angry b/c you never know when someone is going to fall in love with your smile...as long as he keeps smiling at me, my day can't get any better... - Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Hope you find the one that makes you smile. ~ side note from Lady: "If I could hold a *star* for each time you  made me smile, I would have the whole evening *sky* in the palm of my hand" "Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than yours..." - We are each of us angels with only one wing, and we can only fly by embracing one another.- Luciano de Crescenzo  - Many things in life will catch your eye, but only a few will catch your heart.  - If you want to know what love is, give much of yourself.   Be honest. Be sincere. Be thoughtful. Be understanding. Be patient and still. Be ready to get hurt. - Sometimes you know in your heart you love someone, but you have to go away before your head can figure it out. - A friend will help you move.  A good friend will help you move a body. - "You don't love a woman because she is beautiful, but she is beautiful because you love her."  - "Nunc scio quit sit amor." Lat., "Now I know what love is."-Virgil  "Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength; loving someone deeply gives you courage."-Lao-Tzu - A baby is born with its hands clenched as if to say, "The world is mine, I shall take it."  A man dies with open hands as if to say, "I could take nothing with me." "We all dream; we do not understand our dreams, yet we act as if nothing strange goes on in our sleep minds, strange at least by comparison with the logical, purposeful doings of our minds when we are awake."
