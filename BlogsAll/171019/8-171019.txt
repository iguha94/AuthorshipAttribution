What a day today has been.  I feel good as though I have accomplished alot.  When in reality, there is still much to be done.  I guess that when I woke up this morning and had more than my usual amount of quiet time in reflecting over the Bible and after reading the Bible, I was stretching out and I had this feeling inside of me that everything was going to be okay.  Throughout everything, the one constant thing in my life has been the steady growth of my faith.  Christ has been amazing to me.  No matter what has happened, He has been there by my side.  I worked six hours today and went to four hours of classes.  In addition to that, I found enough time to run errands and relax a little bit.  I even took a little nap.  *^_^*  heehee..and now, I'm getting ready to head on out to study/work.  Does that make sense?  I get paid $12.75 an hour to sit there and eat free food and drinks and study?  It's okay..it's one of my jobs.  =oï¿½  Anyway, I'll be with my sisters and nothing else could be better.  They're so wonderful.  I know that I cannot talk too much about them but what can I say?  Words fail to describe the entity of the euphoria that they have brought to me.  Actually, it's not completely euphoric because there is no such thing as perfect except in Christ.  What my sisters represent to me is this amazing timeless friendship.  And all friendships go through their ups and downs but it is those pitfalls that make a friendship stronger and through our mistakes, we all learn.  awww...I miss you all!!  And to all those other sisters who are supporting us, I thank you for everything and I thank you for giving us a chance and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity like this.  *^_^*  heheee..okay, time to go to work and see my sisters!!  PS: babe, Happy Official Five Months!
