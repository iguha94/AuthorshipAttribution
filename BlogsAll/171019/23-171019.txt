Six papers this week...five down and one more to go...amazing.  Amazing.  That's all I can say at this point in time.  I'm still on my natural high and feel invincible.  *^_^*  I'm sooo loving this right now.  heehee...Seriously, I still can't get over everything right now..I mean, I've been writing papers like mad and going about my life as usual except for wearing my letters every day. Playsia 11: Riter's Blok was a hit. I loved performing in it and the ones in my play, thank you for giving me this opportunity to write and direct my first play. And for all the others in that class, thank you. Thank you for helping me learn more about myself and the capabilities that I had but wasn't aware of. A belated happy 20th birthday to my pledge sister, STINA!! *^_^* heehee...and to my big sis, Marcelle, yay!! You're done with finals..so happy for you. Hopefully, I'll be in that same boat soon. To my friends, *hugz* once again, thank you sooo much for coming up. It meant so much to me to see you guys here to share in an epoch moment for me.  To my pledge sisters, *hugz* When I think about us, tears still come to my eyes and I still get all happy and that warm feeling inside pervades my very soul! I love you twelve strong lovely ladies sooo much!! As soon as I can, the website will be up and we'll be showing off our UCSB aKDPhi pride..heehee...*^_^*
