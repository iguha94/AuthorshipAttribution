Here's a wing update from the wingman Kuan and me... Gamekeepers (Armitage & Lincoln): Thursdays 10 cents wings Overall Rating from Donna: 9     Overall Rating from Kuan: 9.5 When we first got there, we were slightly thrown off the emptiness of the place (but it was also ten degrees below and snowing) but the waitress was super nice and she was at every beck and call.  The setup was very sports bar like.  Just lots of bar space and setup - Kuan and I sat at a small table and ordered their cajun fries smothered with cheese.  There was no drink minimum (woohoo) and they had FOUR types of wings - homemade BBQ, mild, hot, and d*mn hot!  ;-)  Since I have such a low tolerance for spicy stuff, we ordered a dozen bbq and dozen mild.  We also got a pitcher of michelob ultra (ya know - low carbs and calories!) FOR ONLY $7.  FOOD was a 10+++  The wings were bigger than even McGees and they were DELISH which also included a side of celery and carrots, too.  Their ranch was a little sweet but still really good.  They gave us a LOT of fries, too.  Surprisingly enough, the 24 wings was enough for the two of us.  (Hey, $2.40 - not bad at all)  So, current rankings: Monday nights: Hawkeyes (Donna: 7.4 and Kuan: 9) Tuesday nights: McGees (Donna: 8  and Kuan 7.5)  Wednesday nights: Kelly's Pub (Donna: 4.4  and Kuan: 5)  Thursday nights: Gamekeepers (Donna: 9  and Kuan: 9.5)
