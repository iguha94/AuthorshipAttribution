here's another update copies and pasted from xanga...only cuz it has pictures :-) I'm happy...I'm really happy - a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders..I've decided on the job.  I've decided to stay with PCOM.  Money isn't going to make me happier...if anything, it's just going to me stabilize myself fiinancially but it's definately not going to help me stabilize emotionally or career-wise and location-wise.  So, goodbye to 17 people underneath me and reporting to me..goodbye to my own personal secretary...and goodbye to $65K/year..and NO REGRETS.  Instead, I am happy with where I am in life.  I have a stable job where I enjoy what I'm doing...I'm in a great part-time program where it's not only benefiting myself personally but it's benefiting my career...I have a wonderful boyfriend (enough said about him)..  I have a great support sytem (my parents - as kooky as they can be, Mom said to go for the money and my Dad said to go with my heart...my sibs...my pledge sisters...my HS buddies...my greek sisters)...and yesterday was just the icing on the cake...after I made up my mind about the job, I got to hang out with the Midwest Alumnae at Gamekeepers (I love their 10 cent wings!!  Such a great deal)!!  Pictures coming soon...  and on that note, Happy Friday the 13th!  :::EDIT::  I know that I haven't been online lately - basically, at work, they upgraded all of our computers and usually, I'll sneak in some side work (like KDPhi stuff and some personal stuff)...anyway, the new IT administrator added some new features to our computers, including the fact that I can't download anything and install any new programs which sucks...but the worst part is: he installed this program that takes a screenshot of my computer once an hour and then, sends it to our administration - so they know exactly what we're doing and which programs we have running.  I didn't get caught but one of my co-workers got caught checking personal email, another got caught applying for another job, and another one got caught for chatting....so, I'm being good now at work.           AND I found the perfect studio and turned in the application for it...if all works out, I'm living in a highrise right by Lake Shore Drive with a gorgeous view of the city AND the lake...*sigh*  It's beautiful and spacious!
