Man...I'm so lame.  I typed out this huge thing and then accidently deleted it.  *bleah*  Anyway, first and foremost: "When I find myself fading, I close my eyes and realize my friends are my energy." to my sisters, things are hard, but with you by my side, I can go on and we can face ANYTHING together..just stick together..nek��y�l� Rocky - ch�z�b� *^_^* for the shake and for being a buddy..heehee..hey, once you cross, can you adopt me as your lil' sis?  and ba.an hay qua' john, C�m on anh!!  Okay, other than that.  Why am I lame?  I'm a silly ole' girl, too.  This morning, since I really didn't sleep, I was working on my paper, I brought my keyboard up so I could rest my elbows and then, next thing you know, I fell asleep at the keyboard and *sigh*  I woke up an hour later with the indentation of the keyboard on my forehead and face with about 32 pages of random gibberish from my face.  *ugh*  Okay, about Sunday and back to my frustration.  Well, after church, I spent the rest of my afternoon just staying at home and working on my papers and studying and doing homework.  Just being a good lil' girl.  Oh, yeah, ch�z�b� Rocky again for being a buddy.  Anyway, my boyfriend called me and I was pretty happy to hear his voice.  Anyway, we were teasing and kidding around about stuff.  He teased me and asked 'What happened to the sweet innocent girl that I first started dating'  In retort, I accidently said 'So, what happened to the sweet romantic guy that I first fell in love with?'...bad idea.  He got pretty mad about the whole thing.  So, we got into a 'fight' but I don't know if you could really call it a fight.  So, I provoked him, but I wasn't fighting back.  Alot of the things that he said hurt my feelings.  So, with each word of anger that he said, a tear rolled down my face and I was choking back sobs because I didn't want him to hear me cry..  I don't really want to repeat the things that he said.  Basically, he hung up on me.  My first instinct was to call one of my friends and try to resort out my feelings, but I stopped.  This problem was between my boyfriend and me.  Not my friend and me.  So, I picked up the phone and tried to talk to him, but he said that he didn't want to talk and then, hung up on me.  I was so frustrated and sobs were just dying to burst out of me.  So, I threw on my blue windbreaker jacket and exchanged my boxers for my blue running shorts and just ran out the door without even saying bye to my apartmentmate.  *sigh*  I was just sobbing and crying and running like a mad woman.  I ran all the way out to the pier.  I ended up sprinting down the pier in the pouring rain completely soaked to the bone.  What did I realize while I was out there...  I've been doing some thinking and I owe him a major apology.  I realized something today.  I love him.  But besides that, I love him for who he is.  I shouldn't have said all that stuff about him not being romantic anymore, because that's not why I fell in love with him.  If anything, he's just human and I fell in love for all those human qualities, and faults, too.  I fell in love with him for who he is ~ stubborn, independent, pretty boy, yet at the same time, caring and simply wonderful.  Guys are lame.  Hear me out why.  Guys are romantic and sweet when they're pursuing a girl, but once they get the girl, they begin to take her for granted.  They stop being romantic and sweet and their excuse is that there is no need to do such things.  They spoil a girl and then, expect her to still be happy with just the guy.  They go back to being lazy and they expect the girl to be happy with him when he's hasn't really changed but gone back to being his normal self.  He's comfortable enough with her to show her the real him.  And I realized something..I am stupid.  I love my boyfriend for who he is and I cannot seem to stress that enough.  All that extra romantic stuff..that was sweet.  But that's not why I fell in love with him.  Anyone can do that stuff but nobody can be my Duy Ba Dinh, my honey, ~ the man that I love.  *^_^*  I know how corny this is beginning to sound, but...I don't care.  I have spent more dates with him at a computer show and have had more fun than dinner and a movie with him..no offense or anything meant, hon.  But at the same time, there is so much going on and all I ask for is his blind trust and I know that's a difficult thing to ask for, especially long distance..but I know that we can work out..I just need him to try...  I was still very upset and crying as I was running in the pouring rain and I saw this car coming towards me and I jumped out of its way, but I guess that I didn't fully get out of its way.  The side mirror hit me and I went stumbling forward.  I thought that I had regained my balance but instead, my foot tripped over the speedbump and I was a mess.  I limped over to my closest friend's place and Pat said that I showed up with blood on my hands and leg and sock and shoe and snot and tears all over my face.  Icky, huh?  Anyway, he didn't have any band-aids so I ended up going to the hockey game so I could clean up myself.  I'm glad that I went.  My hockey boys cheered me up and I was proud of their win ~ so proud that I baked them all cookies..heehee..  But yeah, my boys are great..heehee..congrats Pat, Son, Rocky, Randy, and Dinh!!  The game was so great.  Randy was totally on fire and Pat had some pretty awesome saves.  Son scored!!  *^_^*  this time, he scored for our team =o�  And Rocky aka the old man did pretty well besides being all pooped out..it's okay, old man.  *^_^*  ANyway, despite my frustrations, my friends aka my sisters or my hockey boys help me feel better.  So, now, I have a bad cough and kinda sick from running the rain and my knee aches sooo badly and I have an ankle brace on...my lesson?  I need to find a new safer method of releasing my frustrations.  *sigh*
