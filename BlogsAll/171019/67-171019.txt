To clear up a lot of confusion or rumors...no, I am not engaged.  Yes, my boyfriend and I are deeply in love with each other and we do see a future together, but it's not like that.  We're taking things step by step.  Our relationship has always been unrushed and taken when we are ready.  I know that we talk about all these things...we talk about our kids and how we're going to raise them...we talk about our dream house.  BUT...at the same time, we're not both not at a stage in our lives where we're ready to commit and settle down.  I see myself still trying to get myself out of debt for another two-three years.  I see myself wanting to buy my condo first before I do anything else...and yes, I would like to get my driver's license before marriage :-P  Some things just need to come first.  I just started my job at PCOM and I would like to get myself settled and ready to start moving forward with this job.  Kuan just started with Cornerstone America - for goodness sakes, he just got his business cards last week.  For him, I know that he needs to financially stabilize himself first.  Yeah - financial stability is a very important aspect in both of our lives.  So, yeah - I do see Kuan as my future, but at the same time, I am focusing on my present and that entails: my career, my schooling...heehee...definately working on my massage license is another focus of mine, as well, and saving up for my condo.
