omg....I got off of work and managed to score myself a free queen sized mattress off of Craigslist - I swear, I am sooo addicted to CL.  :-)  I love how easy it is to post stuff on there and also how easy it is to exchange things, as well.  It took Kuan and I about 30 minutes to set everything up - luckily the place was only like 5 blocks from my house which was pretty cool.  I'm excited - it's only a year old and it even has a pillow top and looks pretty new, too.  YAY!  Afterwards, we went to KMart to get some clothesline rope to tie the mattress to the top of his car...and we saw this deal with Little Cesar's Pizza...one large pizza with one topping for only $5 and crazy bread for 99 cents....yup - that's what we had for dinner.  We were supposed to hit up this networking mixer at the Union Bar but we got there and drove around for like 45 minutes looking for parking and in the end, we just scrapped the idea and drove by my new studio...and Kuan mentioned how much it's gonna be a pain in the butt to find parking when I move into my new place.  We'll see, I guess.  Dunno what else to say.  Sacrificing the boyfriend's request to have decent parking wasn't in my top priorities when I was house hunting.  came back..got some cuddle time with him and then, I passed out.  Omg...I was sooo tired and then, I woke up two hours later panicky cuz I haven't packed yet for this weekend's trip to baltimore!  *sigh*  So I'm taking a break from packing to blog.  *smilez*  And now, back to packing!
