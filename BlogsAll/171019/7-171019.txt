I'm so tired and frustrated.  Frustrated about what?  I don't know anymore.  Well, actually, I do.  I guess that I'm just in denial over the whole thing.  I want to believe that everything will turn out okay.  I guess that I should go down the list.  School.  Gosh, I don't know anymore.  Finals are upcoming and I should be worried.  I guess that I'm just so braindead from all these papers.  I turned in two yesterday and two today and I have two more due on Thursday.  Crazy, huh?  Sometimes, being an English major just isn't fun at all.  *bleah*  I'm doing okay in school.  I know that I can do better but this quarter isn't just only hard but I'm so tired.  I'm tired from working so much.  Work.  Another tiring task.  I don't know anymore.  Honestly, I like working.  I enjoy working, but I guess that I have come to a point in my life when I just want to stop working and just concentrate on school and concentrate on other things.  I'm very worried about my standardized tests for graduate school.  I graduate in a year and I need to take those darned tests.  I just don't know anymore.  Just so tired.  What else?  Fellowship and Christ.  My walk with Christ is improving as time goes on, especially lately with all the tragedies taking place and especially with my sisters there by my side to pull me thorugh everything and to help me out.  They have been a tremendous amount of support to me.  My sisters.  They are so wonderful.  I know that things aren't easy but with them there, I know that we can do anything as long as we are together.  I know that I cannot say much but not that much needs to be said.  Through thick and thin, we'll make it through!!  My family.  When am I not worried about them?  I guess that if anything, I just feel worse because I cannot be there for them, especially my siblings...  but the frustrating thing right now?  Gosh, I want to talk about it..but not right now...the timing isn't right yet...I'll tell you about this weekend another day...
