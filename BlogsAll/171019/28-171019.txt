Have you ever thought about this...I was talking to this one guy friend of mine...well, technically about a few months back, he used to like me but I was currently in a relationship back then.  Anyway, I'm all talking to him and he keeps on mentioning how he wants to go to SB to go hang out or something like that.  Okay...and then, during our conversation, another friend that I have that knows him ims me and she and I start chatting up and she mentions how she can't stand him because he's so whupped by his gf...he never mentioned his gf to me so I wanna know the story cuz I love hearing love stories *^_^*  heehee...anyway, so I start questioning him about his love life and he totally denies it.  UGH...why would he deny such a thing.  So, my friend ims him and those two start talking about his gf...he tells her that he's going to go drive down later tonight to see her and stuff.  I don't get why he can't just tell me about her.  It's not like I'm jealous or care about him having a gf.  I'm happy for him but it's kinda hard being happy for someone if they won't share.  My friend thinks that he still has feelings and he doesn't want me to know about his gf....I don't get it.  I don't think that I ever will get it.  Oh, well.  *bleah*  Kinda bugs me but it kinda doesn't.  I've got other things on my mind.  Some stuff that I'd rather not share but this I guess that I'll blog about...  I'm not sure if any of this sounds stupid or what, but here goes.  Whenever my crush calls me or when I talk to him, I feel alot better and I always smile when I hear the special ringtone that I have set up for him so I know that it's him calling.  I'm scared sh*tless though that I might get hurt again.  I totally want to trust him and just let go.  I know that I'm not fake around him and if anything, I get kinda giddy but overall, I'm pretty me.  I'm the simple basic Donna.  =oï¿½  But at the same time, a part of me wants to hold back, scared to let go and scared to risk getting hurt again.  And another thing...I don't think it's fair for him.  I don't know what to think.  I feel bad in the sense that I don't have this whole heart to give to him.  I've loved before and I've lost, but a part of me has remained in the past.  I know that I've left that behind in the past and now is now.  I don't even know how to say this.  Things have already begun moving for the two of us.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know if I could just say, "no, this isn't going to work out..let's just go back to being friends" because if I say that, it's just me running away from a chance and me denying myself a chance to explore this...is it worth the risk though?  dayam...so scared.  At the same time, what if we do try something and it doesn't work out.  What then?  I lose him as something more...and I lose him as my best guy friend...and I lose a part of my heart all over again.  As much as I will deny that I hold back from him, I already have loved him as my best guy friend.  I don't know what I'd do if I lost that...  I don't want us to fade into the past....I don't want us to be just a fling.  I don't want a fling...I don't want a temporary thing anymore.  At first and for a while, I didn't really care and I had this huge fear of commitment.  Don't get me wrong.  That fear is still very strongly there, but I know this much...I'm willing to try...which is more than anything that I've done..  I don't know what I'm saying anymore when I really should be doing my homework...well, guess that I'll be off to the computer lab to do my Chinese labs.  *bleah*
