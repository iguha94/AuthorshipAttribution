Lady Mamoru: and for that, i want to despise him so much Lady Mamoru: "A relationship is like a rose, How long it lasts, no one knows; Love can erase an awful past, Love can be yours, you'll see at last; To feel that love, it makes you sigh, To have it leave, you'd rather die; You hope you've found that special rose, 'Cause you love and care for the one you chose."  Lady Mamoru: Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength; loving someone deeply gives you courage Lady Mamoru: i don't feel strong..
