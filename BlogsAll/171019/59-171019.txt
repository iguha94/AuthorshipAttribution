oh gosh...  I feel so horrible right now.  My phone bill has been skyrocketing lately and I'm not sure where to really cut down.  It was really high in November because I was talking a lot with an old friend who was going through some troubled times...and it went up in December because I was just stupid and wasn't aware of my minutes...and now, I have this $500 phone bill...and they disconnected me last night.  Which I was completely unaware of and I thought that my boyfriend was just taking a break and was having one of his nights out since he said that he'd call me later but he didn't.  It turns out that he did try calling me like 4/5 times but it said that my phone was disconnected; shortly after I went to bed, he called up my roommate.  And then, this morning, I really had to use my cell phone..so what happens?  Sheesh...I had to pay off all $500 of the phone bill which has me freaking nervous cuz I have a bill that is going to come through on the 21st of January and that's the day before my payday.  :(  I'll just have to call them up and see if they can pull the check out on the 22nd, instead.  *sigh*  Life is one big whirlwind and I hate how money can affect so many of our lives.  I hate how money always manages to run life...how much you can enjoy it..how much you can hate for it...about it...stressing about needing more money...working your butt off to get more...and hurting...cuz you don't have enough.
