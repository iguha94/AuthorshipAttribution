All of my teams won last night - WOOHOO!! Yay for Oklahoma cowboys, especially!!  And St.Joe's! (Kuan has them going to the Championships...but I have Okie beating them out next game)...yay for UConN!!  And yay for Alabama - who would have guessed it?!  But yay for them!!!  I have them going to the final four..hahah..wishful thinking, eh?  Oh, well..It's POURING rain outside and I have no desire to get up to go to work, BUT I do know that there is some money waiting to be made for me.  I'll prolly get my butt and at 'em in about another 15 minutes.  I woke up this morning to the plip plop of rain on my skylight - yeah, I dunno about having skylights when I buy my own place.  True, it really does save you on electricity and heat but the summers are practically unbearable unless you have a window, too.  Anyway...I worked out last night - went running before the crazy rains...and this morning, I did my usual crunches (110 to the front...60 to the right side and 60 to the left side), my pushups, my ab roller thingy for 11 minutes and then, I showered and crawled right back into bed.  I always worry about Leng waking up in the middle of my little workout and giving me a funny look.  It still surprises me that she hasn't done that yet.  Oh, well.  I kinda wish that I went out with them last night to the Apartment but I also know how tired I am..plus I really wanted to watch my basketball games...and I also had homework to do and stuff to study for in Anatomy.  *sigh*
