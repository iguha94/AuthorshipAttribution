What is love? When we claim that it's love that  we have for someone, are we correct?  Here some things to ponder upon.....  ** Are your palms sweaty, is your heart racing  and is your voice is caught in your chest?  It isn't love; it's like.  ** You can't keep your eyes or hands off of him,  am I right?  It isn't love; it's lust.  ** Are you proud, and eager to show him off?  It isn't love; it's luck.  ** Do you want him because you know they're  there?  It isn't love; it's loneliness.  ** Are you there because it's what everyone  wants?  It isn't love; it's loyalty.  ** Are you there because he kissed you, or held  your hand?  It isn't love; it's low confidence.  ** Do you stay for their confessions of love,  because you don't want to hurt him?  It isn't love; it's pity.  ** Do you belong to him because his sight makes  your heart skip a beat?  It isn't love; it's infatuation.  ** Do you pardon his faults because you care  about him?  It isn't love; it's friendship.  ** Do you tell him every day he's the only one  you think of?  It isn't love; it's a lie.  ** Are you willing to give all of your favorite  things for his sake?  It isn't love; it's charity.  ** Does your heart ache and break when he's sad?  Then it's love.  ** Do you cry for their pain, even when he's  strong?  Then it's love.  ** Do his eyes see your true heart, and touch  your soul so deeply it hurts?  Then it's love. ** Do you stay because a blinding,  incomprehensible mix of pain and relation pulls  you close and holds you there?  Then it's love.  ** Do you accept his faults because they're a  part of who he is?  Then it's love.  ** Are you attracted to others, but stay with him  faithfully without regret?  Then it's love.  ** Would you allow him to leave you, not because  he wants to but because he has to?  Then it's love.  ** Would you give him your heart, your life, your  death?  Then it's love.  Now, if love is painful, and tortures us so, why  do we love? Why is it all we search for in life?  This pain, this agony? Why is it all we long for?  This torture, this powerful death of self? Why?  The answer is so simple cause it's...LOVE.  It is so addictive that even people who are not  having it wish to experience and share it with  someone. That's what God gave us, love.
