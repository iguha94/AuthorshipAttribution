So much is running through my head but it's nothing that I feel like sharing.  I can't fully describe..actually, I can't describe it.  I just feel so lost and confused.  I just went out and ran and ran and ran until my body couldn't run anymore (which yes, I know, I can't run very far as Joe can tell you since I'm so darn out of shape *sigh*).  I don't know anything anymore and I realize how confused I feel.  To my pledge sisters, thanx for being there and still supporting me despite me.  To my family, I hella miss you all.  I wish that I could have spent more time with you. I'm going to try my hardest to be able to go down south next weekend to be with all of you again.  I hella miss you all....To all the aKDPhi sisters that I met and hung out with this past weekend, you all are so wonderful *^_^*....UCR, you ladies hosted an awesome retreat ~ greatly appreciated!  I guess that I need to get something off of my mind.  I feel that I have been running away fromt his one problem for a hella long time.  In fact, I've been running away since March of this year.  Because of this problem, I've avoided going back and I've been keeping myself hella busy in Santa Barbara with school, working two jobs, and pledging.  Because of this problem, other problems surfaced.  For the past few weeks, I've been feeling so guilty and I feel as though I've been this terrible persona nd haven't been there to support people that I love.  I had a family member call me up tonight to tell me how disappointed she was in me because I haven't been there for anyone.  I've been too busy and selfish here in SB.  I dunno what to think right now.  I'm just feeling hella down and I think that I'm gonna go shower and maybe crash...or maybe run again..
