Lemme vent about our Receptionist....grrr...his name is R.  just R. for now.  Okay, I've worked in professional places before...you either have a freaking receptionist to ANNOUNCE phone calls or you just have an automated system that redirects you.  He never announces phone calls, NEVER - lemme just repeat that and he's a dumb@$$.  He redirects the most unworthy phone calls to me - for example, some lady wanted to contact an old teacher that we fired.  And she wasted a good 10 minutes of my time.  Oh, another thing - if I'm in a f*cking appointment/interview, do NOT direct calls to me - are you retarded or something?  The most distracting thing is when I'm in the middle of interviewing someone and my phone is just ringing off the d*mn hook.  You retard - just freaking redirect it to my voicemail - is that so freaking hard to do?!?  And today...I get into work and there is a main printer right next to my office and I'm printing up some reports and I pick up two extra papers...and they're freaking cover letters for job applications from R.  How freaking retarded are you?  First of all, he just started here two weeks ago and he does a sh*tty job already.  And he's applying for jobs at his current job...Second of all, if you're going to print something personal, HIDE IT....or freaking go to the printer as soon as you print something to grab it off the printer.  Man....I'm ready to fire his @$$ before he even quits here.
