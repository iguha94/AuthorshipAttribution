I should feel better cuz it's Friday but I'm not... I'm super sore from my acupuncture treatment I'm sleepy and I did not sleep well.  I'm so busy with work and school and I have no time.  No time to freaking concentrate and work on anything...I'm gettiing so frustrated and I'm ready to just throw in the towel right now.  I'm tired of people taking me for granted and people not appreciating my time and effort.  Fawk you.  Fuck you for not being appreciative and being so damn demanding.  Everything is getting on my nerves.  I took my cell phone off of AIM - people pissed me off way too much.  On a side note...I guess that I'm finally getting around to taking care of some things.. Picture Update :-) Midyear 2004 (Houston, Texas)... on the plane with Purdue: Tessa & Yvonne (Essence & Elite)         And you got the National Alumnae Board holding it down...and of course, below, the Spring 2K1 Charters, then, me with my Donna :-P (btw, Don - the pic underneath is for you!)         And wow...I used to be VP Internal (a long time ago) when these two girls were pledging....and look at them now as the new and improved VP Internals!      Now, for my weekend trip to Purdue (after work on Saturday)...I was greeted with this hot charter...      To everyone that I saw - good seeing y'all - my Spring 2k1 (Connie, Elise, and Linda), Purdue KDPhis (congrats on a great first party, girls - and sending you girls much love and support always), UIC KDPhis (especially my biggie..as if I don't see you enough ;-) ), UIUC KDPhis, TaoTao holding it down for UMich, Tracey representing UPenn, and all the boys, of course.           haha...pictures that I am not posting on my other xanga but I'll post here..
