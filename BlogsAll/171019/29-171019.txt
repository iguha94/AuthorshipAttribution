I am feeling so drained right now.  Last night, I definately needed it.  Thank you, my girls, my pledge sisters for a great meeting.  You all made me laugh and I felt good again.  It was a good break from the frustrations of life.  And Eddie, thank you for last night.  Thanks for not getting too mad at me for falling asleep on you even though you just sat there on the phone in absolute silence for 45 minutes.  =oï¿½  heehee...and thanx for putting up with my funky rambling and weird thoughts...  There's still so much going on and the little bits of relaxation that I do get are greatly appreciated.  Right now, I'm at work.  I really do enjoy my job here so much..here at the writing department is like my little oasis away from a problem filled reality.  I don't know where to begin...there is just alot on my mind.  Chinese 3 is almost over..now, it's just alot of cramming tests and last minute reviews before the final on Friday.  In addition to that, just all this other stuff is consuming my time.  I constantly worry about my family and I wish that I could be there more for them.  There are other personal/social obligations/situations that I don't really feel like delving into that are constantly on my mind, too.  I guess that I am my usual busy self that feels slightly overwhelmed right now....
