Okay, so Kuan and I drove down to Purdue for the Lambda/KDPhi party  okay...when we first got there, he dropped me off at the hotel so i could nap and he could go eat with the charters...but i couldn't sleep..i got this weird vibe that someone was watching me...and the curtains over the window wouldn't close all the way...  So, Kuan comes back; we get ready for the party; go to the party; go to the Lambda house afterwards and come back to sleep at the hotel...I passed out first...and had this trippy dream.  I dreamt about some sort of book or whatever and I was with this group and they were talking about seances and spirits and stuff.  Towards the end of the dream, I dreamt that there was someone sitting at the coffee table in the hotel room with me and he was staring up at this dead body hanging from the ceiling - right by the window.  That's when I wake up and I shake Kuan to tell him that I just had a nightmare and when he asked what it was about, I said "Ghosts"...he shuddered and groaned and went back to sleep...when he woke up, he said that he had problems sleeping and for some reason, he felt like someone was watching him when he turned off the lights...so he was watching tv for like two hours before actually going to bed.  And the weird trippy thing is that he felt like someone from the window or that corner by the table was watching him.......*SHUDDER*
