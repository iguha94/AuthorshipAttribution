Oh I get it   Apparently   John Manley  is in the running to replace Lord Robertson as secretary general of NATO.  I posted a couple of weeks ago about Manley's withdrawal from the Liberal leadership race. I drew the uninformed conclusion (by some standards) that it was just a crapshoot as to whether Copps or Manley would pull out first. A relation of mine, who has been known to play football with the Minister of National Heritage, noted that "Copps is a gritty woman and is in a fight till the end".   As I have never attempted to block a full body tackle from an unpadded, cleat-shod Ms. Copps, I suppose I have no claim to authority in the matter. It's just as well as I really have no claim to authority on anything that I write about, but that's another issue.  I've got no real point here, except to mention the reason that the story caught my eye in the first place. I read the headline as:    OTTAWA - John Manley is being considered as a candidate to replace Loyd Robertson as secretary-general of NATO.    I just couldn't remember when Loyd Roberston became such a diplomat. I mean, he's got great hair and a voice like hot buttered sex, but Secretary General of NATO?   After realising that is actually "Lord" Robertson who is in charge of the organization I decided that it wasn't going to be a funny post, unless I made you all picture Sheila Copps levelling a shoulder into my brother's sternum during a quiet Sunday game of touch.  Heh.   "hot buttered sex" and Sheila Copps in the same post. Let's let the search engines try to sort this out.
