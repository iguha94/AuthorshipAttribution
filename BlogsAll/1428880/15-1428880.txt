One step forward, and a few leaps back   My girlfriend and I went to   the Pride parade , on Sunday in Toronto.    I think my favorite moment was when the "Pride in our Bodies" group marched in front of us; They were 8, completely naked men, some of whom had fanny packs and water bottles tied around their waists.  It was a little breezy out there on Bloor St., so it came as no surprise to anyone when the metal cart they had constructed to carry their belongings (as they had had no pockets) blew over and crashed to the pavement.  So here's 8 naked men who had to first, jump out of the way of the collapsing, oversized metal rickshaw, and then try to figure out how to put it back up.  That's part of the problem with being naked: if a big metal cart blows over and catches you on the way down, chances are it's going to leave a scuff.  No one was hurt of course, but there was a lot of squatting and bending during the gathering up of the promotional pamphlets and the righting of the cart.  Men will apparently continue to be men, even when they're standing naked in the middle of a major downtown arterial.  On that subject,   there is this reaction  from the States to Canada's endorsement of homosexual marriage.  So if it is formally proposed, and passed, it would make homosexuality essentially illegal in the United States.  That is to say if it is  unconstitutional  for two men or two women to be a recognized couple, it is the penultimate step towards making homosexuality illegal.  Someone once told me that I complain too much about Americans.  I'll promise not to complain, but just line up the evidence and let it rest.  How can I make fun of a country that lives its own hypocrisy every day?
