Nunziata's timeline   So   here's the story from the Star  where the York Region police lay out what Mr. Nunziata says happened in the "inducement" scandal. The first call was at 3 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 28. It came from a Toronto lobbyist who, according to sources, was the person who allegedly tried to get John Nunziata to drop out of the race for mayor. What's interesting is Nunziata's reaction to the offer: John Nunziata, who has spoken about the incident but not named names, has said publicly he was outraged at the offer. Sources describe his reaction that evening in this way. "He went ballistic. He immediately wanted to go to the police. He even suggested that somebody wear a wire and try and get the offer on tape."  Nunziata's advisers calmed him down, and Naldini was instructed to call Pellegrini back with a refusal.  "Tell him I am not for sale, I am not a quitter," Nunziata said that night. Obviously, I have no knowledge of any of this, but   here's the way-back-machine story  from the Star on September 22 of this year, where Nunziata is quoted as saying this: "I know the other camps would like to see me not be in the race. But I can give you my unqualified, solemn commitment that my name will be on the ballot; I will be there," Nunziata said, adding: "And let me tell you another thing: The Nunziatas are not quitters. I'm not a quitter." Maybe I'm the only one who thinks that Nunziata was approached with some kind of offer before he says he was, on the 28th of September.
