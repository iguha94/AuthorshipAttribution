Heh     Nerd pop.   I first heard these guys on "  Le Show " hosted by Harry Schearer (the very same).  I love the customer reviews on Amazon.ca.  They're pretty useful when you've "kind of heard good reviews" about something but still don't know much about it.  "See all customer results" and pick "Lowest rated first", then see if you can live with the faults of your potential purchase.   High Rating   "Fountains of Wayne are todays only masters of the three minute pop song. Welcome Interstate Managers is 16 tracks each with a sweet hook. I was singing along to songs the first time I heard them. The bands songwriters Adam Schlesinger and Chris Collingwood are a bizzarre modern day version of Lennon and McCartney. They pay homage to sounds of the past while putting their own stamp on each song. With their intelligent/funny/sweet lyrics and endless melodies Fountains Of Wayne should be one of the biggest bands around, but since the charts disagree they can just be your secret."   Low Rating   "After hearing Stacey's Mom and Bright Future in Sales, I rushed out to get this cd. Unfortunately, I was disgusted after hearing the rest of the tracks. This is a joke. There is no seriousness at all to this album. The songs are so corny and such jokes that they sound like Weird Al Yankovich. This is definately one of those albums with two good songs and the rest god awful."   So, to review, I looked at the "faults" of the potential purchase and decided "Yes.  I can still enjoy a CD even if it sounds like Weird Al Yankovich".
