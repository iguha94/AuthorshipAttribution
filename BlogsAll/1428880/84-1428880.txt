Election Day   Go out and vote now.  Please.  There's too much at stake in this election for anyone to be "too busy" to vote.  The advanced polls have been busier then they've been in years.  Voter turnout is slated to be high throughout the day, so please don't let anyone else take your place.  Get out and cast your ballot in this election.   Where on earth do I go and vote?     Click here , and type your address into the little boxes.  The magical computer elves will tell you where to vote today.   Oh my god.  I didn't receive a voter notification card....   Yeah, you and half the city.  Most of us young-type people generally flit from apartment to apartment across this town, so we're more likely to NOT have received a card.  Because I'm a civics geek (and because I work in City Hall) I went and filled out an "Application to Amend the Voters List" about a month ago and got my card.  Because you didn't, you'll have to take some   identification  to your polling place (see above) and you may have to swear an oath that you are who you say you are.  You swear a lot anyway, so it should be natural.   Yeah, but I haven't really been paying attention.  Who should I vote for?   If you haven't heard about the election issues, or any of the candidates, then you should really cut back on the weed.  Or at least the Joe Schmo marathons on Spike.  Off to the   left hand side**   of this page you'll see a list of mayoral candidates with websites.  Try and focus for a few minutes and peruse the info on there.  There's also some other opinion blogs for you to check out.  Ready?  Enjoy today because the City changes tomorrow morning.  ** Update  (Seems I need to lay off the whatever as well.  That should read...."Off to the right hand side of this page.....")
