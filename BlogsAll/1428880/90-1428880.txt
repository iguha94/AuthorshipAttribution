Edward Q. Broadbent   No, I don't know what his middle name is, but everything's catchier when there's a Q involved.  From this morning's Globe and Mail, former NDP leader Ed Broadbent   lays out his reasons  for getting back into national politics.  And here's a twist, he's running for leader of the newly united right: Instead of slashing social programs such as education and health to compete, as Mr. Ibbitson would recommend, these countries correctly see such expenditures as providing a competitive advantage. General Motors and Ford, among other reasons, choose to invest in Canada over the United States because, as a result of publicly financed health care, they don't have to provide their workers here with health-care benefits.  If I'm nominated and elected, I will work flat out with Jack Layton to rid Canada of the pre-1940s economic and social policies currently being pursued. Jack Layton's priority on the cities did not wait for an election year.  He has also shown how we could be combining environmental and economic concerns by building fuel-efficient cars. While Paul Martin was evading a clear answer on Kyoto, Mr. Layton actually led the battle in Toronto to put the new wind turbine on the city's waterfront. While Mr. Martin conducts seminars on the "politics of achievement," Jack Layton acts. Just kidding.  He's not running for the   Conservalliance .  Come on.  That's a great name.  Any takers out there?  Stephen?  Peter?  Preston?  How about the Alliancervatives?  Did someone already do these?
