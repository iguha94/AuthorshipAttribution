God I love this   There was a canadian group back in the 70's and 80's called the Rhino party.  It was told to me (because I can't remember back that far) that the Rhino mandate was to get apathetic voters interested in politics.  They did this by running candidates in federal elections, on crazy platforms: "A national bake sale to eliminate the debt" or "Raise all streets 30 feet off the ground to prevent pedestrian fatalities" or "Build a bridge from the mainland to PEI".....  The candidates were usually younger, but the point was that through humour, they raised the interest in political issues from apathy to "I wonder how the other candidates would deal with the issue".  I can only assume that   Simon Shaw  was either a former Rhino party member, or someone who admired their style of campaigning.  Here's a quote from his website under the section titled "Environment": Wind turbines by the 100's located approximately .5 km south off the shore of Lake Ontario.  No eyesores close to shore with environmentally friendly energy generated by wind.   Now...I'm no physicist, but I think if you put "100's" of wind turbines approximately 500 m south, off the shore of Lake Ontario, they might sink a little.  Just a little mind you.  Perhaps Candidate Shaw was considering building an island or draining the lake enough to give them stable footing.  I'm also unclear how putting hundreds of wind turbines 500 meters into Lake Ontario, would  not  be an eyesore.  He also states: I want our beaches back.  For my entire life I have been told not to swim in lake Ontario.  Will it be ok for my grandchildren to swim in it.  The answer will probably be the same if we do not act now.  We must push ourselves and our neighbors to the south to act with environmental responsibility.   Well.  If the lake is filled with hundreds of wind turbines, im not sure where our grandchildren are supposed to swim.
