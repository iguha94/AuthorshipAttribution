Ah the famous JDBGMGR.EXE virus   I had temporarily forgotten the panic that   hoax virus warnings  can create in an office filled with people who are generally unsure about computers to begin with.  For those of you who haven't received this one yet (and I find it hard to believe that you haven't), it's the one that tells you about a virus that has infected your Windows operating system, and will unleash it's terrible fury after 14 dormant days on your machine.  The hoax lays out careful instructions on how to find the file (type the file name into "find" and there it is).  The icon that you find, is a little teddy bear icon, and is an *.exe file that is actually a java debugging program.  The email tells you that the teddy bear is actually a virus, and must be deleted from your machine.  Oh, and forward the email to everyone in your address book, because the virus has already forwarded itself to them ahead of your warning.  This one takes an interesting turn however as it was originally forwarded by an IT staffer who does a lot of programing for our databases, and even caught the eye of our resident computer expert on the floor.  It also made its way to the masses, including one Chicken Little who marched down the floor from cubicle to cubicle telling people about this virus that had mysteriously infected everyone's machine, and left nothing but a cute teddy bear icon behind.  The Chicken Little in question had already phoned the person who forwarded it to her, the IT help desk, our departmental IT staff, and of course, the General Manager.  It remains to be seen as to whether all of these people have deleted the file or not.  I suppose I shouldn't be so critical.  After all I am the man who was convinced that "whitehouse.org" was the actual White House web page, and proceeded to   forward this , ensuring everyone that it was a legitimate questionaire from the American government.
