Prepare to humble yourselves   There's a protest happening outside of City Hall right now.  There is a proposed by-law that will ban residential pesticide use in the City of Toronto.  As people are inherently abhorant to change, there are loud and sometimes low-brow arguments from both camps.  As an example....both use  children  in their protesting.   Anti-pesticides  (Pro pesticide ban):  Pesticides are environmentally persistant.  We are spraying chemicals on the lawns and fields that our children play on every day.  Why do you want to poison our children?   Pro-Pesticides  (Anti pesticide ban):  Most of the "ban pesticide" arguments are based on faulty science.  Without proper care and control of lawns and fields, our children will have no place to play.  Why do you want to take these green pastures away from our children?  Much of this harkens back to the "this union hates children" argument from our colourfully, ignorant mayor.  Personally I think anyone who envokes children to deliever their side of a debate are petty, pseudo-child pornographers, who aim for the lowest common denominator of uninformed public opinion.  But hey...that's just one blogger's opinion.  You can find out what all the fuss is about by   checking out the motion  from Economic Development and Parks in the agenda for today's City Council meeting.  You'll note that item (c) is the one pertaining to the potential pesticide ban.  Item (a) of course is the one pertaining to the   2004 visit by the Dalai Lama to the City of Toronto  .    Yeah...THAT Dalai Lama.    Yeah...THAT Toronto.  Man.  I stayed out of town during Pope-a-palooza last summer, but next year?  I'll go and see that.
