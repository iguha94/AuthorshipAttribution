The Geek Riseth   I say to my brethren, that we have found our way to power.  Warren Kinsella is a senior Liberal party strategist, adviser to Chretien , McGuinty and, given time, Martin.  And given even more time,   Sutherland .    This is the kind of thing Warren Kinsella posts   on his blog : December 12, 2003 - This ran in the Ottawa Citizen today, apparently. Found it online, but haven't seen the paper, yet. Hope the photo shows me with lots of hair!  ...  SECTION: Arts; Pg. D1 LENGTH: 170 words HEADLINE: Lord of the Rings SOURCE: The Ottawa Citizen BODY:   Warren Kinsella, author, lawyer, campaign adviser to Jean Chretien and Dalton McGuinty.  Q: When did you read The Lord of the Rings?   Kinsella: I confess to having read it while in the throes of adolescence, when 16 or so. I was a student at Bishop Carroll High School in Calgary, and - not surprisingly - I hung out with a lot of weird people. It was only natural, therefore, that we all read The Lord of the Rings. I seem to also recall that we also made use of some, ahem, imagination accelerants while reading the books. I have been advised by my legal counsel to say nothing further in that regard.  Q: If you were in The Lord of the Rings, who would you be?  Kinsella: Stockwell Day might say I was Grima Wormtongue, but I like to think of myself as Sam, Frodo's pal - you know, a good hobbit to have on your side when engaged in a pitched battle with the forces of all that is Evil and Corrupt.  Everything you need to know about The Lord of The Rings: See the special supplement in Saturday's Citizen.  GRAPHIC: Colour Photo: (Warren Kinsella) A geek on message.  Now there's a scary thought.
