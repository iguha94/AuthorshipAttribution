Remembering John.  Forgetting Irony.   Below, the readers of the   Toronto Star , remember Actor/Comedian John Ritter:   "He was good entertainment for everyone, especially in the times we are facing."  "I will always remember John Ritter best for his brilliant performance on Three's Company. I also enjoyed the movies that he did and also thought that 8 Simple Rules was a great comeback for him. Most of all, I will remember John Ritter for his kind eyes and gentle smile. Today the world has lost some of the laughter it so desperately needs at this time."  "He made us laugh, he made us smile; but no one is laughing or smiling now without his company on our television sets. God Bless him, his family, and friends."  "He was good entertainment for everyone, especially in the times we are facing."   It has become clear that:  a) We are living in difficult/chaotic times. b) We need humour to help us feel better about the world. c) John Ritter, apparently, made us feel better about the world.  Seriously now.  John Ritter.  The guy who played Jack Tripper on Three's Company.  The guy who starred in the Problem Child movies.  The guy who was third in line behind Howard Hesseman, and Drew Carey any time ABC needed a host for a TV sitcom retrospective show.  Will there be an equal outpouring of grief for Problem Child co-star Gilbert Godfried?  Will Pauly Shore be remembered as "one of the greatest comedians of all time"?  Says one reader "Three's Company was just one show that people tuned in to in order to escape from the politics of the day. It was the age of innocence."  Yeah.  The late 1970s was truly the age of innocence.
