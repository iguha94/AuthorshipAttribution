Is it clear by now?   There are 11 people on our floor today.  11 out of about 40 or so who would normally be milling about.  This should explain the sharp spike in blog posts from yours truly.  If I stand up in my little veal fattening pen (thank you Douglas Coupland), I can see 6 offices all with their lights out.  On this floor that means that no one has been in to that office in the past 20 minutes or so, to trip the motion sensor that turns on the lights.  It's a very special time of year in the City.  It's the time of year when nothing gets done for 2 months solid because everyone is on vacation.  It's not to say that everyone takes vacation at the same time; that would be much more efficient.  Everyone takes a week here and there through the summer which means that everytime I make a phone call to move a project along, or get approval for something I'm met with " Actually I'm just filling in for her, you'll have to wait till she gets back.  I can't really say 'yes' or 'no' to that ".  It's doubley special this year, because even after people get back, City Council disolves after it's September meeting in advance of the November 10 municipal election.  This means that no new committee reports can be drafted, considered or passed until the new Mayor appoints the new committees, and until they meet for the first "real" time in February.  Don't look for any change to the complex issue of litter jurisdiction untill next March or so.
