Mayoral Notes   There were 3 mayoral candidates in the Pride parade on Sunday.  In order: David Miller; John Tory; Barbara Hall.  Hall had a float, a DJ and the largest throng of supporters, including Toronto Centre-Rosedale councillors Pam McConnell and Kyle Rae.  Rae's Executive Assistant Chris Phibbs is running for a seat in Ward 30 (Riverdale South), and was heavily endorsed on stickers proclaiming "Dykes Lyke Phibbs".  Tory had a group of supporters around him who were all wearing orange t-shirts.  I'm not sure if it's just because "Orange is the new Black", or if Tory is trying to pass himself off as left wing.  Miller had a large group of supporters, most of whom spilled back into the OPSEU crowd sporting "I support Miller" on rainbow backed picket signs.  I don't belive Tom Jakobek, John Nunziata or Don Andrews were present in, or in attendance at, the parade.  Ever wonder what a "Nationalist" campaign platform looks like?    Here's one .  Most notably (I've added italics):  - Will introduce a motion to officially declare and proclaim European Heritage Week in the City of Toronto;  - Will set up an educational program to keep the city sidewalks clean,  especially in selected ethnic neighbourhoods;    - Will introduce a by-law to have English translations provided on all commercial signs in all parts of Metro Toronto;  - Will establish a special fund to aid homeowners to preserve the cultural integrity of their neighbourhoods;  - Will work to increase the size of Toronto's police and work with them to establish a New Immigrant Crimes Unit;
