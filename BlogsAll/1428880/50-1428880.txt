In which the author makes another shocking admission   So I'm watching WWE Smackdown on Thursday night...  The "  A-Train " comes out and does what a lot of heel wrestlers do: He badmouthed the crowd.  Now other wrestlers stoop to insulting the local hockey or basketball teams, in who's stadiums they are currently performing.  But that wasn't for A-Train.  He grabbed the mike and marched around the ring proclaiming that he could beat, in order:  Brock Lesner (current champion)  Kurt Angle (disputed champion)  Or any one of you (points to the crowd)  The crowd naturally reacted to each of his statements.  The crowd does not like A-Train.    The crowd's reaction was, in order:  Loud booing, some shouting (Him? he's 20 times better then you!!) Louder booing, more yelling (the crowd really likes Angle) Screaming and Yelling from every individual in the stadium.  From the platinum blonds wearing the bicycle shorts, right through to the 300lb trucker wearing the "Fuck Fear:Drink Beer" t-shirt in the front row. Like for an instant every one of them would have lept into the ring with the 6'7" 350lb wrestler, simply because he said "I can beat you".  Now I'm not down on wrestling crowds and, as I can testify, most of the fun of being at a live wrestling show is cheer and boo along with everyone else.  It's just that it was such a funny pantomime-y thing for the crowd to react so much more emphatically when this en-masse challange was made.
