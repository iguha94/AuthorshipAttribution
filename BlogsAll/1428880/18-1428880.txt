The things Eves says   In honour of this latest Ontario/Califonria style heatwave and power crisis, I thought I'd post a comparison between two statements.  The environment minister said on Tuesday that we should cut back on outdoor barbeque use in the midst of the heatwave.  He claimed that barbeques contribute to the smog problem, so we should all cut back.    Premier Eves lent his support to the confusing request,    quoted in the star : Meanwhile, Premier Ernie Eves said he is doing his bit to reduce smog by not using his barbecue. "I happened to order in Swiss Chalet last night instead of barbecuing," he said.  There were a lot of statements made (in the same article I think) about how it's not in fact barbeques that are contributing to the smog problem, but say, the Lakeview coal fired generator that's belching out tonnes and tonnes of particulate matter.  Or maybe the amount of cars that flood the road every day on the way into work, and every evening delivering roasted chicken to our Premier.  I would argue that based on Swiss Chalet's own   description of how their chicken is made,  that Premier Eves' choice of meal on Tuesday night was in direct contravention of his Minister's policies: Our signature Rotisserie Chicken is slowly roasted over an open flame so it can baste in its own juices until crispy and golden on the outside and tender and moist inside, just the way you like it.  So we can either barbeque our own chicken, or have someone else do it, and then drive it to us.  The Premier prefers the latter.  Perhaps the Premier believes that there are some atmostpheric clensing properties inherent in Swiss Chalet's famous tangy dipping sauce?
