Wait a minute, wait a minute....   Are you telling me, that a municipal politician, accepted favours from a bidding vendor, in exchange for potential influence,   and then lied about it ?  Here?  In Toronto the Good?  Ok, it's not like he   killed the woman he was having an affair with  and then hid her body.    But let's be clear.  This is a man, who is running for mayor of the largest city in Canada;   who spent his time on council as budget cheif cutting and eroding the budgets of some of the most basic programs;   who, in   a front page interview  with the Toronto Star quoted the man administering his IQ test as saying his results were: " High Tom, very high ";   and who, in the same front page article showed contempt for the inquiry which he now bows before, indicating that the MFP inquiry hasn't " got anything " on him.  This is a man who, when asked by several media outlets whether he was on a private flight to Philadelphia to see a Leafs game, payed for by the computer leasing firm MFP, said over and over again " I was not on that flight ".  Keep in mind that this is the same flight that Dash Domi said he was "fairly certain" Jakobek was not on; this is the same flight who's manifest records list Jakobek as on the plane.  When it was suggested that his failure to come forward with the truth actually cost the municipal taxpayers a lot of money, Jakobek replied " I will agree with you that I may have indirectly caused an expenditure which may be picked up by the taxpayer ,"  Indirectly folks.  Indirectly.   This is Mayoral candidate number one.  We have 4 other "serious" ones and a multitude of transvestites, buskers, and assorted licorice to wade through   before November .
