Welcome to September   I flipped my   NOW  magazine calendar this morning at my desk.  I won it, while standing in line for opera tickets last January.  The pictures on the calendar are all NOW cover images from 2002.  All celebrities, local or otherwise, and all black and white photography.  April was Woody Allen.  August was Sam Roberts.    September is Ron Jeremy.  Wearing a white suit, with windswept hair on the top of a building in Toronto.  Holding a fake, plastic rooster in his left hand.  At the bottom of each calendar month is a quote from the currently pictured celebrity:  " Let me see John Gielgud do Hamlet with a boner.  It's not easy. " - Porn actor Ron Jeremy.  My closest (geographically) colleague's desk calendar features sad looking, adoptable cats and dogs for the SPCA.  Another has a Gary Larson calendar because "That guy is so funny.  I don't know why he ever stopped drawing cartoons.  He's so funny".  Over the course of a month colleagues, and managers drift to my desk to ask about work, or input on projects.  Each month, when met with yet another featured celebrity that they've never heard of, I am required to explain.  "Him?  Oh he's Sam Roberts.  He's a musician from Montreal."  "Oh.  Ok.  Why do you have a calendar of him?"  "It's a calendar of cover's from NOW magazine...."  "Wow.  That's weird."  I may deny knowledge of the current celebrity, and see who recognizes him over the course of a month.  The hedgehog continues to headline, on floor 25.
