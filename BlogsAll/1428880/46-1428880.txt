Tory thinks you're a slob   From the Tory press release dated August 5:  Pick Up Toronto!   Tuesday, August 05, 2003  Toronto mayoral candidate John Tory today announced his Pick Up Toronto! initiative that will clean up the citys streets, parks and public places with the help of students, the public and private sectors.   As mayor, I will declare war on litter, garbage and graffiti, said Tory. Pick Up Toronto! means dramatically reducing the garbage, litter, posters and graffiti in our public spaces. It involves City Hall, schools, businesses and citizen volunteers. And it will combine public and private funding.   We now spend about $16 million a year managing street waste, and yet, youd hardly know it from the litter in our public spaces and the graffiti on our walls.   Tory plans to hire 1,500 students next summer to clean up garbage, litter and graffiti. Pick Up Toronto! will engage the private sector (including fast food chains whose product wrappers are a major source of litter), to play their part in cleaning up the city. Citizens will be involved through Adopt-A-Park initiatives. Tory will also cut bureaucracy at City Hall and make one city department responsible for garbage, litter and graffiti, instead of the current five.   As mayor, I offer new leadership for Toronto, and an action plan to clean up the city, and clean up City Hall, so that once again, Torontonians can hold their heads high and know that they live in the city that works.   I will lead by action and example. I do not offer endless consultation and dithering and I do not offer grandstanding and confrontation. I offer action and results.   Pick Up Toronto! is John Torys third major policy statement and follows Criminals Out, a plan to protect our neighbourhoods, and A Clean Start, a plan to restore trust in government.
