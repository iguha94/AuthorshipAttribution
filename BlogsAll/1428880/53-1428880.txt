Still confused about blogging?   Perhaps Paul Martin can   explain it to you . What is a blog?  No, its not a swamp creature. Its a term used to describe an internet trend that has exploded over the last decade. A blog is a small web page made up of short, regularly updated messages that are arranged in chronological order  like a whats new page, or a journal.  The man credited with inventing the World Wide Web, Oxford scholar and research scientist Tim Berners-Lee, is said to be the first to keep a blog back in 1992, although he didnt realize it at the time. It wasnt until five years later, in 1997, that a man named Jorn Barger actually coined the term weblog, which has since been shortened to simply blog. (Get it??) Barger is said to have paved the way for most bloggers, as the authors of these sites are known, and his blog site, Robot Wisdom, is considered one of the most visited and comprehensive individual blogs in existence. (Netscape also introduced a Whats New page in 1993 that would later be identified as a blog. It also exploded in popularity).  The authors and purposes of blogs vary. A blog could be Joe Citizen  or a group of Joe Citizens  simply wanting to vent about something. Or it could contain commentary and links about whats on the web. It could be ongoing news about a person or idea, or it could even be a photo, essay or poetry blog. Whatever the purpose, they are characterized by the fact that they are typically focused around a single subject, an underlying theme or a unifying concept, and have a high concentration of repeat visitors.
