The Armchair Torturer   The text from the "Speak Out" forum on   thestar.com  today:    Musical torture  First they used heavy metal to rattle Manuel Noriega. Now there are reports that U.S. forces have used the Sesame Street theme - played over and over at excruciating volume - to disorient Iraqi prisoners prior to interrogation. The moral implications of this practice aside, what song or music would you use to irritate your enemies? Just so we're clear, we're not talking about playing music at high volume and shining bight lights into a compound in Waco Texas here.  We're talking about playing loud,   crappy music to prisoners of war  prior to their individual interrogations.  The Toronto Star is asking for your input.  They're asking how you, the reader, would torture someone.  I'm all for pushing the envelope, and being a little controversial, but really.  Torture?  Just try to remember this little tongue-in-cheek forum topic the next time the editors express their moral outrage over something that's meant to be a joke.    If I know the Star's   Speak Out  section there will be a few responses from people who think the Eves' government is going too far with cuts to education, some who include unintentional irony in their statement, and at least one guy who thinks that welfare recipients should "get off their collective duffs" and earn their cheques by torturing Iraqi prisoners.
