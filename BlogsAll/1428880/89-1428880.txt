WDO funding for municipal recycling programs   Mr. Andrew Spicer knows all about this stuff.  Hell, he's even done research about   product stewardship .  I'll be reading that over the holidays.  Spicer took note of Wednesday's announcement as well,   and writes : There are several reasons why this new regulation is good news. The simple story is that municipalities are going to get a sizeable sum of money to offset their waste-disposal costs. The bigger story is that producers will now have to factor these costs into the decisions that they make, thus encouraging them to reduce costs and waste over the long term.  Unfortunately, the system isn't complete. Soon, producers will be responsbile for paying part of the costs for recycling their blue-box material packaging. However, I don't know of plans to charge them for their non-recyclable packaging. Making garbage is free, but if you make something that is recyclable, you have to pay. It should be different: if you make something that you reuse you don't have to pay, if you make something that is recyclable you pay, and if you make something that is not recyclable you pay more. This whole situation is a great start, but it only involves companies who make, or sell items which end up in the blue and grey box streams.  Expanding this kind of stewardship to other areas like household chemicals and paints, tires, motor oil, and other items that aren't in all municipal recycling programs like styrofoam and plastic films.
