David Miller   It's been a couple of weeks since I have been to   his site , but David Miller has redesigned, and generally improved his mayoral website.  I hope that his   Policies and Issues  section will grow over the course of the campaign.  Miller is clearly the "TTC candidate", and I think he'll be recognized for that.  I just hope that he doesn't pigeon-hole his campaign to that issue alone.  He's got 3 councillors who support him directly (Bussin, Johnston, and Pantalone), and a few others who have written letters of   recommendation  and support.  Most notably, famed   urban planning  theorist   Jane Jacobs  who writes:   Jane Jacobs  Letter to supporters January 2003  I'm working for David Miller because I believe this is the most crucial election in Toronto's recent history. Left and right stereotypes are irrelevant because David understands that, as he says, "the city can't work socially unless it works economically". What he has already accomplished tells us how much David can achieve in the years ahead:  - David Miller fought for the public inquiry we now have into the scandalous MFP computer leasing deal.  - David Miller is a leader in the campaign against the Island bridge and expanded airport, which will destroy this City's waterfront heritage.  - When TTC fares were raised, David Miller came up with a plan for companies, hospitals, and schools to get cheaper rates when they buy TTC passes in bulk.   The time has come for new ideas, a new way of conducting business, even for a new generation of politicians. I support David Miller wholeheartedly and with great personal enthusiasm. I believe he is the only person with a coherent vision of Toronto's future, with the ability to do what needs to be done, and the energy and will to do it.
