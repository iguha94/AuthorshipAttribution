Bloogle   I just figure that's what they'll eventually call it.    A little while ago   Google bought Pyra Labs  (the company that owns Blogger).    If I understand the issue correctly, Google is looking for a way to reduce the "noise" created by blogs in their search results.  If 3000 idiots like myself complain that "Gary Coleman running for Governor of California is proof that society is in an ireversable downward spiral that will only end with the physical destruction of the planet", then all of those comments may show up in people searching for "Physical" "Society" and "Gary Coleman".  Opinion laden blogs are seen as "noise" in the vast, completely accurate, landscape of internet publishing, and therefore would need to be filtered out.  Soon aparently.    The Register  has a story (from a couple of days ago) about Google's efforts to categorize blogs as blogs and not webpages.    I'm actually really looking forward to it.  I'd love another tab on Google.    We'll be able to search for "Gary Coleman" and get a list of fan sites, and various   "Gary Coleman Ate My Balls"  spin-offs.  Then, after clicking "image" we can get pictures of Gary, then news references about Gary, and finally blogger opinions about Gary.  Cheap target I know, but it was the first thing that came to my mind.  And believe me, that alone is scarier then any suggestion that I'm a pop culture hack.
