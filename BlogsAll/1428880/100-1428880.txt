My joke does not go over well   So the council debate today is about the   bridge .  Mayor Miller is trying to convince council to re-examine whether a fixed link to the airport should be built.    There are equal pro-bridge protesters and anti-bridge protestors downstairs.  The pro-bridge side have construction workers who are just trying to make an honest living for their families.  The anti-bridge side have doe-eyed children and asthmatic kittens who will no doubt deputate eloquently about increased pollution, noise and traffic.  I went down for lunch at 1:30 and got a coffee with my lunch.  The cafeteria offers barista style lattes, and the milk steamer is louder then all hell.  Louder then say....increased jet traffic to the Toronto island.  My joke, aloud to anyone standing within earshot: (shouting) "Boy, is that what the waterfont is going to sound like if that bridge goes through today?".  I thought I was going to get hit.  Two men to my right glared at me as I smirked back at them.  Their "A Deal's A Deal" buttons indicated their particular stance on the issue.  I nodded to them and got the hell out of Dodge.  I feel no remorse.  Every time council's public gallery is filled by interest groups, all the good sandwiches in the cafeteria are gone by 12:30, and I have to have a a date square for lunch.  I swear to god, they even ate all the egg salad.  Stupid bridge.  I hate date squares.
