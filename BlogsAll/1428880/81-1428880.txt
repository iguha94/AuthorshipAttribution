Zoom out one level   Peace, Order and Good Government, Eh? (  pogge ) has posted an open letter he   wrote to our new Premier .  I like what he's thinking, and I especially like the idea that efficiency for efficiency's sake is a attribute of business; and it should not be an attribute of public services. Dear Dalton:  I read with interest of your intention to keep the Balanced Budget Act and abide by it. "We've got to balance our budgets, and we've got ensure they are transparently so, so that people have faith that when we say the budget is balanced, it really is balanced," he said. Transparency has nothing to do with the numbers themselves. They're two different issues.  I can understand that you found the $5.6 billion deficit sobering. And I'll acknowledge that the secret deals the Tories made have left you fighting for the public interest with one hand tied behind your back. But you appear to be beating too hasty a retreat when you embrace a piece of legislation that you, yourself, have mocked and discredited.  Running a reasonable deficit during an economic downturn in pursuit of sound policy shouldn't be a crime. It's too easy to imagine circumstances when this would be a viable option. The corporate world's all consuming fixation with the next set of financial reports isn't something that government should emulate. Shouldn't you be thinking farther ahead than the end of the year?  By keeping this legislation, you effectively agree to play the game by Tory rules. Falling back on the Tory record every time you back away from a promise becomes a losing proposition because you've chosen to play by those rules. You might want to rethink this one, Dalton.
