A letter with a wild twist that will have you rethinking what you just read...   In this morning's Sun a letter from a reader who takes issue with political correctness.  Keep reading till the end, because it's got a crazy twist: TOMORROW I will be attending the staff Christmas party at the school where I teach. It is called a "Christmas party" and no one objects. In the evening, the students at the school will also join us for a "Christmas party." Again, no one objects. We have a "Christmas tree" in our school. We exchange "Christmas presents." The school is decked out in "Christmas decorations" and, again, no one objects. Tonight I will play "Christmas carols" in class. The streets in our city are decorated with "Christmas decorations." Most people will welcome Santa Claus on Christmas Day as he brings gifts to their children. There is no politically correct movement against the celebration of Christmas. I find this ironic as last year I heard talk of "seasons greetings" and "holiday trees." Last year I was in Canada. This year I live in Japan. Merry Christmas.   Tom Browne   Obihiro, Hokkaido, Japan   (Many Japanese don't really understand Christmas, but they love the festivities) Yeah see...it's all you political correctness wags out there who are ruining Christmas for this man.  Can't you see?!?  Can't you see how your inclusiveness has gone off the deep end, and he just can't love Christmas, and Christ, the same way that he could as a kid?  You're ruining ice cream for him too.  And puppies.  Why don't people like this write to scientists, and cancer researchers, when studies   like this  are released?  Why aren't there letters to the editor complaining that "I  used  to be able to enjoy a corned beef sandwich with mustard and Swiss, but since these do-gooding eggheads want to "stop treating cancer" I guess all the fun has gone out of meal time.  Thanks a lot guys."
