That little feeling   I am starting to understand how New Yorker's felt.  I'm not implying that the Uptown theatre collapse and the World Trade Center attacks are in any way comparable, but I am saying that I am starting to understand the civic pride associated with a disaster.  Those were our firefighters on the roof of the collapsed building searching for survivours.  Those were our police running dogs through the rubble.  There is even a twitch of pride that comes through when you see a competant mayor, generally informed of the situtation, giving live interviews from the scene.  I think this kind of pride is easily co-opted, and corrupted in the wrong hands.  This civic, local pride can be easily turned over to nationalistic pride and jingoism, but I can't imagine that happening in this case.  Toronto's response will focus on learning from the results of an investigation, and support for those injured.    A friend  emailed this clip from Joe Fiorito's column in the   blue box  this morning: Nobody was seeing movies at the Uptown. At the Odeon Varsity cineplex, across the street from the ruined theatre, these films were among those on the billboard: "21 Grams," which is reckoned by Hollywood to be the weight the body loses at the moment of death; and " The Missing." At that moment?   One dead, one thought to be missing." The old Union Pacific doesn't come by here much anymore...
