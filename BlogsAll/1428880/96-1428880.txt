PS2   So I'm doing some shopping online and while reading game reviews I came upon this text from an Edge Magazine reviewer who gave "Ratchet and Clank 2: Going Commando"   a 70% : Edge Magazine Ratchet & Clank 2 shows all the signs of a game that's been focus tested to death; at no point will you have to repeat a section more than three times. It's a frustration free journey but sometimes feels anodyne. [Dec 2003, p.97] Aw come on.  Honestly, who uses  anodyne  in a video game review?  I shouldn't have to   look up a word  when I'm reading Edge Magazine should I?  Well, aparently I do.    When I went to   Edge-online.com  and clicked on "about Edge Magazine" I found this description: The world's leading interactive entertainment magazine, Edge is at the cutting edge of video-gaming technology. With its clean, sophisticated design and informative, erudite writing style, Edge is no conventional videogame magazine.

I think I might be retarded.
