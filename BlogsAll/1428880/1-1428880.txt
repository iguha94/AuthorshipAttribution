The Gaberdeen Army   I took a different path to work today.  For those who don't ride the streetcar in the east end, I'll let you know that the 504 now takes Broadview to King, then King to Church.  It's at this point that the streetcar embarks on a magical mystery tour of the downtown core, making lefts and rights on Richmond, Victoria, and Queen.  That little "jog" takes about 10 minutes, and as I found out this morning, it takes exactly the same amount of time to walk from King and Church, get a coffee and a muffin, and arrive at work, as it does to keep my fat ass in the seat and ride it out.  Walking up Bay, with the flood of passengers from Union Station, was a new experience.  I suppose I had done it before, but I don't think I was ever "on my way to work" with the rest of them.    There's a certain militaristic feel to the march of the upper middle class.  I thought "If Canada was ever at war, and the Lawyers, Bankers and high level Sales Associates of the world were called into service, this is how they'd march".  Cell phones in hand, the soothing swish of gaberdeen pant leg on gaberdeen pant leg.  With designer shoulder bags containing freshly laundered workout clothes, and hands filled with coffee purchased from suburban Tim Horton's on the way to the GO Station.  No guns of course, just a frightening litigous stare.  And running shoes over socks and pantyhose.  And for the record, here are the phrases I typed into Google this morning alone:    "gaberdeen wool" "litigous" "running shoes over socks and pantyhose"
