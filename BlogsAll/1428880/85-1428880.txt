I have a serious problem   I watch election coverage.  Last night, after watching a reasonably good debate on the CBC, I switched to the  other  CBC and watched Saskatchewan election coverage.  It's not the first time I've done it either.  I've watched election coverage for the recent Quebec and PEI provincial elections.  In 2000 I spent an entire evening watching election coverage from another country, and then continued to follow the aftermath of the non-results.  There's something so very universal about how election night anchors cover the evening's results.  They dance from one riding to another and say things like "the incumbent has a huge lead here, no surprise" or "This is one of those bellwether ridings, and it's a race that we'll be watching closely all night.  This one's going to come down to the wire".  I watched the Liberal party's leader give his concession speech after his party was completely shut out of the Legislature.  The final tally of the night saw the 3 term NDP government return with 30 seats, and the right wing Saskatchewan Party bring up the rear with 28 seats.  I'm basing the "Right Wing" statement on a single line from the Saskparty platform (which I also looked up last night):  Establish strict discipline boot camps for chronic repeat young offenders who steal cars and break into homes;  My brother asked me the other day "What are you going to talk about when the municipal election is over?"  I don't know man.  I just don't know.  I guess I'll have to follow the Newfoundland election campaign....
