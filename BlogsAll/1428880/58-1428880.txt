Yet another election   God knows you people don't want to hear about ANOTHER election, but I thought I'd throw this one out in the media awareness file.  Actually I guess it would be in the "logical consistancy" file.  I just got "MSNBC" on cable and I celebrated by watching "  Buchanan and Press " last night when I got home from school.    Pat Buchanan  was interviewing   Pat Robertson , and thanks to the good people at   The Drudge Report  I have a small excerpt of their conversation:   Pat Buchanan:     LET ME TAKE ANOTHER PROMINENT CANDIDATE, ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER. HE IS PRO ABORTION HE IS PRO GAY RIGHTS, HE'S GOT A LIFESTYLE WE COULD CALL BODYBUILDIER LIFESTYLE THAT YOU'VE BEEN READING ABOUT PAT ROBERTSON SHOULD CHRISTIANS IN GOOD CONSCICENCE, CAN THEY VOTE FOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER?     Pat Robertson:    WELL YOU KNOW, I'M A BODY BUILDER. I DO SOME PRETTY HEAVY WEIGHTLIFTING, SO I THINK THE WEIGHTLIFTERS OF THE WORLD NEED TO UNITE. I TELL YOU WHAT THOSE GUYS IN CALIFORNIA COULD USE A BIG BRUISER TO KNOCK SOME HEADS TOGETHER. I MEAN THEY'RE OUT OF CONTROL OVER THERE. SO WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? I MEAN YOU GONNA HAVE BUSTAMANTE WHO IS SORT OF THE GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS LITE? THEY DONT WANT ANYMORE DAVIS, SO WHO ELSE YOU GONNA PUTT IN? I THINK YOU DONT HAVE ANYBODY ELSE THAT'S COMING UP ON THE RADAR SO THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS JUST STAY HOME   Some things to keep in mind:  1)  Pat Robertson is a body builder.  2)  Arnold Schwarzenegger has not identified himself as "Christian" in this campaign at all.  3)  Pat Robertson identifies himself as a Christian, as well as a spiritual leader to Christians.  4)  As a Christian Pat Robertson would normally condemn Schwarzenegger's past, personal behaviour, and would normally continue to condemn Schwarzenegger should he refuse to confess his sins and show remorse for them.  5)  Pat Robertson endorses Arnold Schwarzenegger for Governer of California.
