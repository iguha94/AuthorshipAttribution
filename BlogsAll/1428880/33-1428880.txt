The internet   There's a statement about the internet that has stuck with me:   "The internet is a place where people can bask in pure, unadulterated earnestness. "    The link that followed that statement was   this one .  I'm sure you've seen it, or seen parts of it before.  The long and the short, is that it's the webpage of a man who likes to dress as Peter Pan.  Would we have access to this man's obsession in any other form?  Without the internet he'd have to have a TV show, or write a book, or be featured in a magazine article; and even then we'd only have him for 15 minutes of his fame.  But now, what would have been done in private for most of his life, can be displayed prominently for all the world to see.  He can now take pride, and bask in the earnestness of his creation.    For all the "bad" comments about the internet, the one, general "good" comment, is that it's a global forum for the exchange of ideas.  Here's a site that breaks that down to its most basic structure.    Halfbakery.com  is (I presume) a site for "half baked" ideas.  You can post your own idea, and the viewers will discuss improvements or criticisms of your idea.    I've linked to  one of the best ideas I saw on the site.  A friend and I once decided that the term "fuckin' a hole in her leg" is a phrase that  sounds  like a metaphor, but really isn't at all.  Kind of like "Well....That's the Pope for ya." is the ultimate punchline to a joke that doesn't exist.  There's another statement about the internet that's stayed with me a lot.  And while I won't transcribe it here, you can   watch it for yoruself  anytime.  "I mean James, the internet is a place where absolutely nothing happens.  So you need to take advantage of that"
