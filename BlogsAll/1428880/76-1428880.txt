Vote.  Now.   Today is the day.  Pick a candidate and go out and vote.  You're not too busy to do it.  The polls are open today from 9:00 am until 8:00 pm.  Generally on election day I   turn on the CBC  around 6:30 or 7:00 and watch the coverage gear up, and I encourage you to do the same.  If you don't know where to vote, you can find it at the   elections Ontario  website.  If, like myself, you did not receive an elections Ontario card it means your name won't be on the list when you go to vote.  You can still go to your polling station but you must bring the   information outlined here .  I will be bringing my driver's license.  You can also bring a pair of items that show both your signature and your residence (like a water or telephone bill,  and  a credit card or passport).  If you don't know who's running in your riding you can find out at the   election prediction  website, which has the added bonus of telling you what others in your riding are saying about the candidates.  Currently electionprediction.com shows the Liberals with 69 seats, the PCs with 26, the NDPs with 8, and 0 for any other party (Green included).  The site shows that 0 ridings in Ontario are too close to call.  We'll have to see what the final tally is tonight, but all predictions and polls seem to point to a massive Liberal majority.  Massive.
