Dude are you being sarcastic?   Ok.  Here's the scenario:  I'm on the streetcar and two guys get on.  They are both wearing the same red t-shirt that hangs down to their knees.  In iron-on letters both shirts proclaim identical messages: "I've got the bling".  The gentlemen are wearing red white and blue baseball hats (with the NBA logo if I'm not completely mistaken).  They've got baby blue warm ups, big-ass shoes, and yes....bling.  Gold chains, pendants, possibly a watch.  One is white the other is possibly Hispanic.  Both are well mannered, save their loud conversation, even pausing before boarding the street car to help two mothers carry strollers out of the car.    It was their conversation that had me wondering "Are they two actors in character, or are they for real?"  It was what they spoke about that had me confused.  I'd always figured that "real" ganstaz wouldn't be loose charactures of the stereotype.    Here's a verbatim sample: " Yo check it.  I got this sick chain 'aight, and I'm lookin' for some mad bling to hang it.  There's this pendant yo, this sick pendant, and I'm like 'Isat real gold yo? '"  They were just two young men talking about accessories on the streetcar ride home.  I listened and listened and tried to hear if they dropped out of character, to see if they would deny their appearance and confer about delivery, or style, or costume.  We were on our way up to Broadview station, which is close to an improv theatre company.  I smiled as I thought "They're just getting ready for a show tonight".  But were they?  That's what's got me all befuddled today.  Were these two guys wiggers or were they   Fubar -esque charactures of wiggers?
