Not the CNN transcript that I promised, but it will fill the void   Remember that Simpsons' parody on 'personal interest stories'?  It was "Kent's People" and the subject matter "tuggs at the heartstrings and fogs the mind..."  Here's exactly what they were parodying.  From a   report on CNN yesterday :    VICKY DUNCAN, WRTV CORRESPONDENT: This Muncie Burger King's been here 35 years.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tom Ray's here.  DUNCAN: It's safe to say this is Tom Ray's favorite lunch spot.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's done been about the most consistent customer you can imagine.  DUNCAN: Consistent is an understatement. Mr. Ray doesn't have to even order.  TOM RAY, BURGER KING CUSTOMER: Oh, no, I never order.  DUNCAN: Because everyone knows he always gets the same thing.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cheeseburger, ketchup and mustard, apple pie, a handful of French fries and a coffee.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We just like to get it ready for him by the time he gets in here so he can go ahead and go set down.  RAY: That's service. Why would I want to go other places?  DUNCAN: And he hasn't. Mr. Ray's had lunch here Monday through Friday for the last 27 years.  RAY: But I figure it must be something close to 7,000 identical meals. There are a lot of people in this world who like variety. And I'm not one of them.  DUNCAN: Mr. Ray's routine is about to change. No more burgers or fries will be served here after Friday. The restaurant is closing.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It has been a very good restaurant.  DUNCAN: But the owners say it's time for change.  RAY: Unfortunately, about the only thing in this world that's for sure is change.  DUNCAN: And change is what Mr. Ray will do. Come lunch time on Monday.  RAY: A different way of life. But, I'll survive.  DUNCAN: In Muncie, Indiana, Vicky Duncan for CNN.   (cue "Turn Turn Turn".....'This is Kent Brockman......Reporting")  It will be "A different way of life.  But I'll survive"....without a BURGER KING!  The really sad part, is that as stupid as this story was....it still doesn't beat Lastman anouncing that he had never heard of the World Health Organziation, on CNN.
