I think I've got them all   I feel like a kid in a Pokemon store....  Off to the right there, you'll see the "Leadership" column.  Since early June I've been linking to Toronto mayoral candidates who have websites.  Of the 44 candidates running, 21 have websites you can visit to read their platforms.    Joe Fiorito's column  today poo-poo's candidates who simply refer their platforms online, but I have to disagree.  If there's 44 candidates who are serious about being mayor, there should be 44 websites to visit.  There's 2.5 million people in this village, and I doubt any one of the candidates could knock on that many doors, and hand out that many pamphlets.  A website should never replace campaigning, but it's an absolute necessity in this era, and more then half of the candidates running in this election are so behind the times, that they chose not to put up campaign sites.  Here's two more I added just now:    Albert Howell  - One of the two devil's advocates.  He's also the candidate with the best slogan: "Albert Howell for mayor.  Truth.  Honesty.  Not lying."    Ahmad Shehab  - Has quite a resume, including: "Special advisor to the United Nations envoy", "Marriage Counselor at the Islamic Information and Da'wah Centre", and "Black Belt Two Degree Taekwondo".  Oh yeah, and if you type - "Ben Kerr" mayor toronto - into Google, you get   this site .  If anyone out there speaks Persian and can translate it, I'll put it up on the site.  For those who aren't familiar with Yonge and Bloor, Ben Kerr is the kindly old maritimer who stands on the North East corner singing kindly old maritime songs.
