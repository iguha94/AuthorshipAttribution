Into the belly   My girlfriend and I will be traveling for the next 5 days.  We're heading down to Boston area to enjoy the sights and sounds of American Thanksgiving.  We've got two friends from Ontario who moved down there recently, and just think the idea of 4 Canadians celebrating American Thanksgiving in America is kind of funny.  Plus, there will be yams.  I will make an effort to post while we're down there, so you can look back here over the next couple of days for a dispatch from within.  I've been planning and organizing our travel information and documents over the last couple of days, and as I was going through my bag I realized that I had to leave something behind, lest I wish to do time in an American prison.    I'm a man who moisturizes, and as such I had a tube of The Body Shop "  Hemp Hand Protector " in my bag.    I am leaving it here.  It's exactly the kind of thing that can get a Canuck into hot water on the dismal side of the 49th parallel.  We are bringing a Canadian care package for our ex-pat friends that includes:  Tim Horton's Coffee  Red Rose Tea  President's Choice Decadent Chocolate Chip Cookies  Kraft Dinner  Swiss Chalet Tangy Dipping Sauce Mix  The "instant mashed potatos" idea was nixed before it was formed.  Until next time.
