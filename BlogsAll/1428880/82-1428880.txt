Pondering Sacrafice   I attended the Rememberance Day ceremonies at Old City Hall this morning.  Afterwards I walked up Yonge and found a couple of used book stores that I needed to browse through.  Over the course of the morning, I overheard two things that I think illustrate the day.  I don't mean for this to sound holier then thou, but for what it's worth, here's what I overheard:  At the service - 11:30 am  A group of 13-14 year olds are fidgiting and giggling during the laying of the wreaths.  There's a steady drizzle, and they're jockeying and pushing to get space under the few umbrellas that they had brought.  At one point a woman walks from behind me, to the group and lectures them about their behaviour.  She's clearly a complete stranger.  Emboldened by her move, a 40 something husband beside me says to his wife:    "I'm gonna find out what school those little brats are from and call them up after this.  They have no respect.  None at all.  They're just a bunch of little brats."   Sushi King - 1:15 pm  Two women in their 40s dine on a plate of sushi ("No octopus ok?  I hate octopus, so I don't want any included in the order"):  "Yeah, that's the thing about Yoga pants....I mean, I like them and everything but here's something you have to keep in mind when you're buying them.  I usually buy them a bit small so they fit tight, but sometimes they.....(Her cellphone rings.  She has a MIDI version of the theme from "Sex and the City" as her ringtone)...Hello?.....No, no I don't want to see that with you......Because it's stupid and I don't want to see it OK?"
