And a rebuttal   The reply to Tory's calls of "highway robbery" the Miller camp put out the following press release that "clarifies" David Miller's   position on toll roads  in Toronto.  It is copied here on   Andrew Spicer's  site.  October 17, 2003, Toronto, Ontario  &#150; Mayoral candidate David Miller responded to a series of news stories regarding toll roads this morning with the following statement:   "A number of media stories have mischaracterized my position on toll roads. Some have stated that tolls are part of my economic platform, which I released yesterday. That is false. Others have stated that I support tolls. That is false.   What I said and what I believe is simple. We will not solve the transit challenges facing this city without the active partnership - and financial involvement - of Ottawa and Queen's Park. They have a responsibility, and they must be held to it. Rebuilding public transit has been my priority all along, and my track record on this is clear.   I've made it a point to talk straight and be open with Torontonians in this campaign. And I'm not about to stop now. I did so yesterday in response to a question about tolls. The fact is that if the other levels of government, for whatever reason, fail to make their proper contribution, Toronto would be forced to look at a range of other alternatives. That's not a platform position. It's not an opinion. It's a fact.   After years of sweeping problems under the rug, Torontonians deserve the truth. My commitment to them is to fight and work hard to make sure that Toronto's public transit is well-funded, and that we don't have to turn to toll roads. And to keep on speaking the truth, because that's what leadership, real leadership, is all about."

(truth be known, I think this rebuttal was actually the subject of Mr. Kinsella's rebuttal that I   pointed out yesterday .)
