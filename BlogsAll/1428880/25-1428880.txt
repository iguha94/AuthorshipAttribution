You guys remember this right?   Sort of interesting that it's happening now.  Remember when the US attacked and destroyed two Iranian oil rigs in 1987?  Neither did I.  Below is a rough breakdown of the case.    Here's a more thorough  breakdown of the case.  In 1992 Iran   applied to the International Court of Justice  to rule on an incident that took place in the Persian Gulf on the 19th of October, 1987.    Does the date sound familiar?  It should.  It was "Black Monday" in the Western world; the 1987 stock market crash.  Iran claims that the United States Navy, contacted the oil rigs after one of their ships had been hit by a mine.  The navy gave the rigs 20 minutes and then open fire with torpedoes and large bore guns.  Two oil rigs were destroyed.  The US claims it had a right to act in self defense after being attacked by a mine that was in the water.  The US claims that Iran mined the water.  Iran claims that Iraq mined the water during the Iran/Iraq war.  The case has bounced around alot.  There have been orders, and counter suits, and statutes of limitations, and time restrictions.  In the last few weeks of February of this year, the court finally heard the case.  As of March 7th, the court has been in deliberations about the case.  That was 3 months ago, and there will be a decision soon.  Just thought you should know.  I'll post the judgement when it happens.  Do a straw poll of those around you.  Do they remember when the US destroyed two Iranian oil rigs?  I mean....I was 10 years old at the time so I don't recall if it was a big news event or not.  But you might think that it would be referred to every now and again.  The annexing of Poland, and the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand seem to pop up in conversation fairly regularily, you'd think this would too.
