         It always seems easier to refer to yourself in third person. Somehow, it seems more distant, less painful, not so real. Maybe?  So they talk today. They talk and somehow she finds herself crying and sobbing. Breaking down. She hasn’t cried like that in a while, not since him. Not since she told him how he hurt her, not since she remembered how he hurt her.   She tells the boyfriend, just like she told him, that she’s not strong enough for heartbreak again. Promised herself and owes it to him to not have extremes, but knows enough to understand and protect herself yet she’s a different person now, she’s stronger.  But why does she question though? Why are there always some nights where she lets him get to her? And why are there always some nights she feels so terribly insecure?  Dumb really.  The boyfriend wants to help her. Begs her to stop. Watches her, attempts to guide her, sometimes even intrudes into her bubble uncomfortably, desperate to heal her I guess. “Don’t do it baby,” “It’s going to be okay, I fucking swear to you,”   Bulimic fucking reject.  She feels ugly and old. Fat. Oversized and disgusting. Terribly disappointed in herself and the person she is, the person she became.   Why does she let him get to her? Why do the wounds still bleed when he attacks? Why isn’t there such a thing as forgive and forget?  She watches.  She sees.  She understands.  Time to move on, these walls have crumbled and its foundation torn down. He hurts her again.   Live and learn.  Let.Go.
