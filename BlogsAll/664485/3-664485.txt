         See, I’m not a guy so I obviously do not understand the obsession with upgrades and what nots and horse power bullshit so please spare me and do not attempt to explain it to me because it comes out as gibberish. Get it? Got it? Good.  Because my mechanic does not.   My reverse sensors have a mind of it’s own because they seem to beep at the weirdest times, there can be an object ten miles away and the bloody thing will start beeping. This can get awful frustrating and ass painfully irritating at traffic lights and knowing kl roads, there is no place you can go without six millions cars around you. fanfuckingtastic.   So I go in to get it fixed and this dude starts telling me about something or another and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and he won’t fucking shut up. I’m late and it only takes about fifteen minutes to readjust the wires. I spent half a bloody hour listening to his nonsense. Gahhhhhhh.  Screw the independence. The next time I’m just going to let whoever take it in.   And still onto cars…:0  All you bastards that park in the disabled spots should be castrated, shot, wringed and put through the steamrollers. Six thousand and seventy two times.   I was very very tempted to write mean sarcastic notes to the assholes today or perhaps accidentally bang their cheap ass sardine can cars but then I was running late so perhaps I will do that tommorow. In any case though, I hope some day you’re crippled and you have to park 10, 000 spots away from the elevators just so you get a taste of your own medicine.   Meanies.   Man, I have something stuck up my ass…and that just came out totally wrong.  I think all this abstinence has made me horny, I humbly apologize….but it keeps the hits coming doesn’t it?  Boobies! Boobies! Boobies! (thank you evan)  Okay, I shall be returned to my den now.     “How the hell could someone not like boobies? Stop the planet and let me off. Christ.”
