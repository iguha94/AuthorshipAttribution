         listen. smile. trust. love.  strong word; funny things that evoke weird things that offset my heart. sparks and chemistry that seem so right and magical scares me. wanting to curl up to you and watch tv forever and play footsie, wanting to have your hand in mine, and wanting you to hold me tighter and tighter and never let go.  giggling and laughing and smiling and feeling so happy it's stupid.  i laugh because you say all the things i want to say and mean it. i laugh because there are tokens of what you mean to me all around my room, roses on every inch for separate occasions but everything remains superficial to the other gifts you present me.   you help me believe in things i have forgotten to dream about and make me want to do better, come out stronger and fight. you make me patient and trusting, learning to understand that not everything is always my way and that sometimes, deep inside, i am a someone and that someone is worth it.  you push me forward but pressure me in right ways. taking care of me as you say, i want to say i'm fragile and watch out because i break and i want to say so many things, things i think about late at night when the world is sleeping and i am worried but then i look into your eyes and feel your body next to mine and the thoughts go away and the hurt slowly fades away.  healing me.  i'd like to think i'm terribly courageous in this step but it actually feels kinda nice and good. right.  i don't know what grows on what. if love is love or how friendship blossomed but i know that tonight, i'm just happy i have you.  thank you.
