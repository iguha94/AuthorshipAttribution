         he told me to open my eyes and reach for beyond what my mind could ever imagine. i laughed, snickered, smiled our secret smile as if to say, i understood yet i was wary(weary) then took a deep breath, spread my wings and  flew  soared.   it has been so good to be back here (malaysia!). the last few years have inched forward and sped by. multiplying and teaching me so many lessons and things i could never even begin to describe nor tell you. they were like treasures interwoven into one another, each unleashing it's own magical powers through the hands of time.   this whole week alone has signified many new beginnings and tied up a vast amount of endings....there are people i will never forget, that have touched my life in their own special ways and have forever marked their place in my heart. i cherish, and am grateful for all the moments and times lost in eternity spent making those. xie xie.  it's hard to imagine that a week from now i will be back across oceans to a place i once knew. i am terribly excited, yet just a little intimidated by the roads before me, "make the right decisions racheal, make the god damn right decisions!"...but yet before that i will see grandma, very possibly for the last time. it is hard sometimes to say goodbye but it is inevitable. i will miss her just as i will miss a lot of life here too.   take care of yourselves you hear me? i should be back here by the eighteenth or so with a new design(!), stories to tell, retardedness to share and bullshit to phantom. so in the meantime do the chicken dance and go bug these fantastic people...  hugs!        +  a small victory    +  angela    +  austin    +  barbtries    +  bottled bliss    +  brickchick    +  brooklynkid    +  chris    +  closetboy    +  cracks in the pavement    +  daria    +  darkmoth    +  devon    +  digital kara    +  digitalnap    +  empress    +  evan    +  fredshead    +  ghostcassette    +  gray, looking like an ashtray.    +  jared    +  jasmine    +  jay    +  josh    +  loveisabitch    +  lovesadrug    +  manicmoods    +  mark spark*    +  mighty mitch    +  missing pieces    +  moby    +  mystery mona    +  nadablog    +  planting impatients    +  reality remixed.    +  rion    +  sandee    +  screw me    + shaynanagins.    +  sze    +  s!ren    +  subinev    +  tim    +  tinman    +  tom    +  torn wide open    +  trabaca    +  wil wheaton    +  wishful thinking      "the smile on your face is the light in the window that tells people you're home.."
