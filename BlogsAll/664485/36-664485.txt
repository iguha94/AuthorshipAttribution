            [10/24/2002 1:55:41 PM | + racheal]  i need..  to get my nails done  to finish up the set  to get my damn assignments done  to work on my grammar  to rehearse my lines  to schedule the classes for my next term  to balance my checkbook  to finish up my speech  to get on a diet to get the photographs printed  all the my, my, my's and get get get's  terribly conceited now aren't we?    [10/24/2002 1:57:48 PM | + racheal]  every time i have a ciggarette i wonder how much of my lungs it blackens now  then i think about how if i'm being anal about it how i should just quit  then i do for the next six hours or so and start being a bitch  then i cave in and finish a pack  (well not really, but more so than i should have anyway)  then i start again  and think again  and so this vicious cycle fucks me up again.   now fucking indecisive are we?    [10/24/2002 1:59:10 PM | + racheal]  i smell of paint, reek of ciggarettes but am filled with hope  what a fucking oxymoron  or not really  whatever the word is anyway  i like honesty on paper  or words in this case  but it's funny to take it all back  when i think i'm boring you to death  or conscious of what i'm saying  pah  this is retarded anyway  harrumph.  back to the painting..   edited to add: you think that one year of this shit and i would have learnt how to hit 'publish' now won't you?
