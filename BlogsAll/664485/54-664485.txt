           hmm..word play comes to my mind but a million beats to every sentence kinda makes it hard. it has been Amazing.  :)  i hesistate to take down the previous post because every time i come in and look at it, it makes me giggle. :p  we had a sold-out opening night and pretty much the whole weekend! hehe, it's just crazy and funny at the same time i guess, frustrating also because guess who couldn't get tickets?!?  haha, nevermind the fact that he took time off work but hah! lol, he's been making up for it though so it's all good.   hid band had a show on friday night too and i think it's kinda cute how we both had good crowds so we were both on this unexplainable typa buzz like the world is so fucking great thing.   damn, i like this guy.  SHIT!  hehe, i take back all i say about men being generally evil because they're not. and i'm just stupid. and retarded.  but it's all good because it's just kinda nice being just me and not being the insecure fuck head i tend to be so it's a really nice experience and ahhhhhhhhhhhh. :P  weeee!  there are a lot of things that seem to hold me back from this but you know how some things just feel 'right'?  it's as if i am sitting here and for once in my whole bloody life i can tell you honestly that i am not worrying it to death, not because there isn't a point but because there's something about being together and that feeling; i don't know if it's love, and i don't know if it's forever, but i know safe. and this feels safe. warm. secure.   very nice.  about time damnit.   :P
