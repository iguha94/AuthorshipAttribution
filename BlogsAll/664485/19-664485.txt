         i guess many people know me better than i do...because much as i REALLY :) tried to stay away..lol, i'm back. so my so called yet well worth 'intermission' was short lived by the sudden need to come online and write a long ass post and talk about myself. :P  where the hell have i been?   i don't quite know really. so many places and back. so so many things has happened since july the first and it's hard to believe that it has only been sixteen days. there was a little scare of a heat stroke in between but after a proper rest and lots of tlc, we were both back on our feet, on the sand and enjoying the breeze. this is all the reasons why i want to live near the beach again. :) but a bay will do i suppose...i am excited, oh wait, make that assholically crazy excited to go back...it's been so long and getting in touch with all the people i used to know and talking to them again has sorta quenched a lot of the fears i had. thank you mom and dad.   i did a crazy thing yesterday. i can't exactly say it was a spur of the moment thing because i went in there with an appointment and everything and said work your magic! hehe, five painfully long hours later (yes, vanity, thy name is woman blah blah) i came out with a wonderfully textured extremely short cropped streaked two toned hair. as said earlier, photo evidence will come later! be warned though, it's  s h o r t !  we picked up the new ford linux?..lynx? whatever the hell it is...c a r yesterday for the mib promotion and it was ass funny because it really just looks like any other normal car untill of course you put one bum at the drivers seat and let him take you to the track and see what his baby can do. i know now all the reasons why a safety belt is so damn important :P   oh, then we also tried to lure   jasmine  out, dumbfully not realizing that she doesn't work in the building anymore. of course it only turned out to be funny for me. but in any case, it was really really good food. i normally don't really rant about what i eat y'know? i'm  particular  but i don't gush over shit ass great tasting food like i'm about to. and it was cheap! well, relatively anyway...and there is nothing more malaysian and kiasu than having mouth watering lobsters that are cheap and good! heheh...though the picking thing you use to take out the 'succulent' flesh thing really reminded me of the same thing gibson used to pick out the strands of hair to be streaked from the cap (instead of the alluminum foil way-lah) and so much for that, i had dessert soon after.  :)  other "big thing" than being back in this place with a dodgy layout is that i purchased a domain the other night. wa ha ha ha. everything is still sorta under wraps but a hot sexy dude with immense unbelievable graphic capabilities has been manipulated into designing it for me. lol, all i can say is that it looks really good and i'm piss excited! the space at   thewarmcompany  from   chris  will still work as the main ftp-ing place something though...i'm not too sure about the 'technical' side of it seeing as i'm pretty crap with the whole html side of it but basically it's a blog cum personal space cum kids update cum friends join thing with some pretty nifty shit and it's all good honey! ehhe..but i should just keep my toes crossed and not build castles in the air eh?   and if none of that just made sense, go   give     money!    i'm sorta caffiene and pretty good day induced right now minus the fact that i really really need to pee but can't step away because i KNOW that this stupid thing won't be here when i'm back so yeah...but rest assured though, you'll get serious more mellow racheal tonight. in other words, i have a nice long essay and shit of the last few days/weeks/months/years all in my mind but have no patience or time or sense to write it now lah!   so i leave you with photos...bad photos. burnt cow, bitches and wet feet photos. big huge asses too.
