         dressed, sleepy, sorta lazily lounging around, cuddling and not doing much...  she's getting ready and plays around with layers and faces. grins at me through the mirror as i watch her in awe...mesmerized. god, she is beautiful.  i flip channels...and for a while, i almost fall into the category of 'the husband'.  flipping, waiting for her...watching the news...singing to myself.  more talk about war, more talk about rhode island. i turn away to hide the tears but then the glint from hers reflects against the mirror too.   it's silly, two girls dressed and made up crying over a news report..  i almost want to say lets not go tonight...lets just stay in and we'll make pasta and run over to blockbuster and maybe rent a movie or something?  but i know i need to get out...or at least she makes me anyway. she does her little jig, and i cannot help but fall into fit of giggles.   she's almost ready now...i get to drive tonight. (i'm in control!) she's tipsy, little alco...but i log in to say i need to do  something first;  it's pouring outside. i've never liked thunderstorms and this whole fire/club thing just hits too close to home.   be safe tonight okay? wherever you are...take care of yourselves.  it's hard to comprehend...the site is on 'hiatus' right now...part of me likes it this way yet the other itching to get it out again. get out of my corner and preach. drone you with long, long irritating whining posts  i love that a part of me is in this world...it always makes me feel so warm inside to 'come home'.   is this for attention? i don't know. but i got it anyway...perhaps i do like it. perhaps i do like going away every once in a while to be alone and find myself. discover the world around.   take care of yourselves people, it's a cold, vicious world out there.  be safe.  i love you.
