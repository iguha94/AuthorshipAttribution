         i might have majorly worried a few people last night. i don't know what possesed me but i lost it, it's almost funny now, still kinda stings but good to know that i'm still breakable. i really don't know why i had such a bad night because essentially, it was a pretty good day. there was a lot more of tears after that post but they were tears i needed to get out..it felt like there was so much pressure bottled up or soemthing. in any case, things are...i don't know, strange right now, trying to find my balance, will get there eventually i suppose.  in another realm completely though and almost uncharacteristic of me, i went in for alternative theraphy today. the method of torture? acupuncture. it was...interesting. i generally don't like needles but then someone suggested that it might help and so we went in and got it done. i freaked out for a good half an hour before anything really happened but i was still piss terrified none the less. nothing like watching needles stuck down you and connecting volts to it.   i still believe it's all in the mind, but oh well, if it makes me parents happy.  i didn't really feel like doing anything today. to be honest, i wanted to just get away from everything. i think i got burnt out from so much activity and thinking in the last few weeks that i might have tired myself out physically too. and you know that when you're tired just about everything else is wrong too.   but then sakthi and archana came over. i forgot i made plans last week so we just went and got dinner. it was nice to be with them. it's nice to be with old friends you know? people that have known you for what seems to be like your whole entire life. when i'm with them i almost feel unjudged, it's just a nice comfortable feeling. it's almost strange how possibly that might have been what i really needed tonight. just us girls against the world. just us, just me, and i can be sad if i want to or i can be bitchy or just cranky and i know it will be alright. they almost numb the pain if even for a just a bit.  we're going to watch hooverstan(?) next week at hard rock. i don't even know the bands name but apparently they're good. and even if they're not we have to get arch a single hot chick with mind blowingly amazing positions. possibly even an orgy too. i'm just going to shut up and smile, me opening my mouth has caused me quite a bit of trouble the last few days.   right now, david is trying to convince me to go to hk for the weekend. in all honesty, it doesn't seem like such a bad idea but then i don't really want to do that either. running away merely just multiplies the confusion and mess. that much i've learnt. so how to get to the root and fix it?  beats the shit out of me.
