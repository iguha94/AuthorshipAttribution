Blue Skies - Ella Fitzgerald.  blue skies, smiling at me nothing but blue skies do I see.  bluebirds, singing a song nothing but bluebirds all day long.  i was blue, just as blue as I could be ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me then good luck came a-knocking at my door skies were gray but they're not gray anymore. blue skies, smiling at me nothing but blue skies do I see.  bluebirds, singing a song nothing but bluebirds all day long.  never saw the sun shining so bright never saw things going so right noticing the days hurrying by when you're in love, my how they fly.  blue days, all of them gone nothing but blue skies from now on..   ---words and music by Irving Berlin    i have red striped pink toenails. for some reason, they are staring back at me and making me laugh. madness. :D  will this be short lived i hear you ask? how long will good and nice racheal last? i'm planning to keep her around, she makes things fun and sorta interesting to be with.   i'm going to go see the kids, then tonight, have dinner with some old friends and i plan on having a good night.   i could twist it all around, and be upset because i'm leaving. and feel fucked up because at least two kids out of the ward won't make it out alive. i could feel sorry for myself because i had a conversation i didn't want to have today. i could be pissed with gibson because i have very short hair and it feels funny, and i could be angry at god because everything in the last few months have just been crazy...  or i could be grateful that i've had a chance to be abroad, to see things, to experience things...i could go in there and smile and make them laugh and play with them, and if they go, they go to the greatest place around, and it's for so much better, and if for every boo boo they've had, they get a million rewards up above, that while they're still around, i've had time with them. i could take my conversation and stick it in the back of my mind, and understand that it just didn't work out. and know that i'll be alright, and know that it is beyond my control now, that everything that made sense from before still does, i just need to balance it out and see the postive rather than the hurt. if i can place all that energy and time spent brooding over the things i cannot control anymore then it will be right because a closed door just opens up to another world. and learn from this. sure, it's another broken relationship, another tear in the heart but oh well, i'll live you know?...and about the hair, it's been pretty interesting. hair grows anyway and i sorta like it. the whole messy spiky look, gives me another reason to change my wardrobe eh?   and to god, you better bloody have things in control because hell yeah, i'm relying on you to have it all figured out.   so it's just life. :)     "I sat stunned for a moment, then continued on my trip, driving much, much slower."
