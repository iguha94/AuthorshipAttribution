                               yes, you're shit out of luck because i'm still here.   i'm quite afraid that should i play my scratched up album of screaming teen angst and an eclectic mix of the sappiest most pathetic ballads my neighbours might snap. bad. because i've only played it all morning and yesterday night. oops.  and if you look at the time and the fact that it's monday then you should have had it all figured out that we didn't get to the beach. which i really did sorta expect except that well, i was kinda looking forward to it. i think. (sorry)  in other news though, i think i got a lot of shit settled somewhere in between friday night and three hours ago. it feels like i have felt every extreme since then and i'm not bitter anymore, just merely unfeeling.   i wrote a lot of things earlier about i felt but then realized that i am at no liberty to talk about it. in fact, i might have already spoken too much.   things are going to okay. and today, that's all i really care about.     "the heart believes in something else that the logical, calculating mind knows to be true. that i can't carry this forever. that, while you have no spiritual believes at all, and that it may bring you no peace, it must be said. to bring peace to itself. it knows that even though it makes no real difference, that it brings you no closer, and perhaps even pushes you further, that it must come to pass.  you are forgiven."
