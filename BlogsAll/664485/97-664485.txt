         Hold it in, I whisper to myself later.  I watched the car pull away, grow tinier and tinier into a distance then disappear. I retreat back alone into this now cold and empty house and walk into disrupted calmness.  I feel the teardrops slide off my face but I do not cry and smile instead. I think about the luxurious weekend I’ve had and the lushness of her warm body beneath the sheets. Her long, thin fingers wrapped with petite little rings and the way her curls frame her face.  We went to a traditional Catholic mass this morning. Her faith against mine I suppose, I’m Lutheran, or at least my parents are…and though the services are very much similar…there’s still quite a bit of differences in them. I loved the incense and candles, the ritualistic/holistic like atmosphere, the father-forgive-me-for-I-have-sinned kneeling and bowing, holy water…and the constant fervor of blessing yourself and making that cross thing. It was beautiful; to feel so lost in a crowd and found.  To have the world disappear before you…retreating into a lost island in the middle of February and have tornadoes crashing behind your porch yet feeling so surreally calm is breathtaking.   Midnight runs on the beach layered up in four layers and an anorak, laughing and feeling your Nikes sink into the sand. Stopping to pick up sand dollars and feeling the ferocious wind push you forward. Her increasingly passionate moans with the crashing of waves outside your bedroom window as her fingers find yours and you discover love together.  The ‘out of town’ rendezvous packs and your magical weekend ends in twenty-four hours.  You step in and you have to pick your troubles back up at the door but you breathe in deeper, and take stronger whiffs…just so to see if the smell of her is still on your clothes.   It is, and you smile again.  Tired, weary of the world….but walked out a while.   Had a break.
