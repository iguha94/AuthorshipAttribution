           meshes.                          "dear you.. it's taken you a while to get here hasn't it? so much has changed..so many crazy turns have ensued from no where and so i hope this comforts...guides, provides hope if and when you need it.  you need to learn to be more aware and responsible for your actions. you've made mistakes along the way getting here and so you know what i mean when i say every action has a reaction. no doubt, there are things that are sometimes, not up to you at all, that are beyond your capabilities or control but there are others too, that are. and living your life well means taking control of it and having enough of strength and dignity to know that you can get through to the next day with a smile and a pieced together solid heart. it's knowing that at the end of the day, come what may you can hold your head up high and be proud of who you are or even just be grateful for that small little thing and not give up.   you have a tendency to believe the things in your mind. you've always been set in your ways..determined little tyrant, you're used to getting things done your way and i know that that very brute and obscene strength that puts you where you want to be is also, a lot of times, the reason why you're stuck in that hole. the reason why you fall. that balance is precariously positioned that it can only be achieved by one who deserves, by one who does not use her ass to think, by one who is calm and rational. by one who thinks.  your very disabilities can work out to be your attributes if you twist the right key, if you turn the right knob.   you are sensitive. i guess we've always known that. i know things hurt you easily, and i know how easy it is to just fall back into routine. to do the things you're used to. to give up halfway because it gets so damn difficult sometimes. i know it's hard and at times you are so tired of everything and feel so lost, know that at those times, the father up above keeps you safe and is watching, that he loves you even if you're weary, haggard and displeasing to the eye. that he'll carry you through footprints in the sand and pick you up when you are down. that itself is the true meaning of love and trust and faith.  every little hurdle, every trial and tribulation, every damn obstacle was put there for a reason...and it's an open path. you still have to make choices and you still have to make decisions to decide the very road you will walk on, the very path you will take.   when no one else believes in you, i will. when no one else listens, i will. and when no one else is there, you'll still be here. alive.   live it like it's meant to be lived. live it like there is no tommorow. live it with no regrets but most importantly, live it for you.   relationships fall apart sometimes. whether it was your fault or his or the both of you, it is time to move on. let go because if that is the only advice i'll give, then it is the best i will ever give. let go because nobody starts a painting on a dirty canvas. nobody builds a house on a crappy foundation. and nobody applies make up to a greasy face. this is your platform. this is your life. this is your decision. this is your turn that only you can make. it's your time, your moment to decide if you will break and fall, or make it and dance.  i know some parts of you that don't understand and perhaps even, don't want to anymore..then don't hang on to it. you've done a good job the last few days and it is something i can be proud of. because unlike other times where the dirt was just swept under the rug, i bear no grudges nor condemnation but rather bear not anything at all. endings and closure merge together to give in to new skin, new life, to rejuvenate, to rediscover, to relive. to start afresh. new. not forgetting where you've been but merely using it for the better.  live one day at a time, let love rule over hate or anger. let trust rule over being afraid. and know that whatever happens, happens.   take care of yourself and know that in your life, there are many many people behind you, willing to help if you ask. know that while you cloud yourself with the less fulfilling events, that you've been blessed abundantly. and so, it isn't really a solution for there is no one specific queastion but merely just a hodge podge of a series of events linked together spurred by actions and strenghtened by humanity.   hold on to humanity spread love if not only because love is how things will fall into places, for you to make love and not war.  if love were only a will to possess, then it is not love; for love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. "   i wrote this last night before i went out because while waiting, i came across an email i wrote to adrian when things were falling apart for him. and then i figured, if i could tell that to him and want him to believe me when i say that things would be right, how can i turn around and not believe it myself? and so, the above letter was written. the things i knew in my mind but needed to write out. just things filtering through my mind, keeping me sane you know?   and it was strange too, because last night, when we all got together, we were all different and changed and completely just sorta dazed a while because we were almost like strangers. and so, it took a good twenty minutes before the smiles became real and genuine, not put on, before the sync was found and we talked and talked and talked. i had not lost them at all but merely just needed time to know them again. and the thing that struck me the most was when someone said that it was hard to just forget. that we had grown up together, lost together, learnt together and cried together. and though we're all in different stages, different parts of the world, that no matter where we are or where we'll ever be that these nails in my heart are embedded forever and love is how we'll stay together. we're all strange and kooky and crazy and silly but it is those things that you hold dear, it is that brainless foot in the mouth responses that you'll always remember, it is the irritating continuos slap on the back that comforts you, it is that annoying high pitched cackle that makes you laugh out loud too. and i guess it was really just to tell myself that while a chapter closes that things will still be right if You hold on. if you believe.  and so i do.      "Now she does her best to move forward, still awkwardly clutching to the hurt. She knows she needs to let it go. In time she will. The words she thought she didn't have come spilling forth onto the computer screen. She tells the truth, no matter what they think. "
