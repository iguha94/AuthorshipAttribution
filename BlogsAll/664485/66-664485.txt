              “You are a child of the Universe... No less than the trees or the stars themselves, You have a right to be here.”    Nightly visits from the Shallot, my heart dreams of breaking free from this tirade, this charade. Open masks that melt like chocolate…so sweet, so wanted. Eternal ecstacy that breaks from happiness, the need to get stripped and naked torments. The need to peel off the layers and come home hounds; who am I exactly?    Colorgenics  tests I make everyone take, he vehemently denies my theory…only to find an email telling me the truth. Right, right, right, wrong. Honesty is beautiful isn’t it?  It’s as if we are all hidden in our own layers, all locked up into our own fears. You aren’t the only one, you are not alone, it’s okay. Being there and feeling safe, the moments he sheds the image and shows heart. You find the not so strong, not so big side he’s willing to show you…and it is beautiful.  Midnight beach football, soft Spanish music that plays in an old forgotten diner. He sings you beauty in a foreign language, shows you love in friendship.   Broken down again, in the middle of a crossroad trying to find your way. Your place in the world, your mark, your strength. So many externalties cascade you from different angles, and so many fears compound your insecurities.  Casting call today, headshots prepared with only the flaws apparently only your eyes see. Tick, tick, tick, the seconds loom. You are afraid, excited, monotone. Worked out the stress and pressures, ex-boyfriend on campus, gym equipment at my disposal, self-abuse in regalia. Getting in shape, kicking some ass, healing with love.  Safe people surround me, carry me when the days are bad.  I am a child of the Universe yesterday, today and tommorow.  I am a product of Love.  Loved.      "It is here for no reason but to make you ask for a reason."
