          out on the rooftops.  ever just sit sometimes and wonder about life and all it's twists and turns?  amazing.  crazy really, but interesting.  so   he's  left. it's strange, but i'm glad he finally did it. and i hope whatever he's doing now, he's happy.  life isn't too bad you know, chisel off the crusty dirty layer...you might find something worth holding on to beneath it.   emotionally fucked is a good term to describe a lot of situations i get myself tangled into, but that's just me you see. sometimes the very things you try and run away from are the things you are made of.   my new start isn't really a big bang or anything, in fact, if i was really anal, it's pretty much the same. just trying again.   so yeah, i make mistakes. i fuck up. i fall down. big fucking deal.  :)  things are good, now hell, That's scary.  today feels strange. or maybe being content is just a whole new experience, closure somewhat does make you see clearer i guess. so does sleep.   oh yes, sleep very very good.  thinking is normally an evil thing, but i'm glad it happened today. :)  i'm so tired of being a cranky bitter bitch and to choke on my own words, life is precious and too short.  hugs   **ironically, the moment i hit publish, the site fails on me. and as forewarned, will fail quite a bit too in the coming days...pah. but the selfish bitch thanks you anyway..:P
