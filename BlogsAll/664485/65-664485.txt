         Sleepy as fuck and going to bed.  Thank you, you.   Maybe I needed that good cry, or you behind the door knowing I was hurting and begging to be let in. Maybe I needed that extra pack of ciggarettes and that violation of trust I fucked while yelling at you. Screaming at you not to touch me and just go the fuck away then driving back to your place many, many hours later to tell you I was sorry. The glimpse of acceptance in your eyes that welcomed me home, as you shared my phone calls and celebrated in my joy.  You are a gift to many, your friendship is as fragile as porcelain as solid as rock and I am thankful.  You are beautiful. I have your fingers tugging at my heart, your hands at my soul and you are among the reasons why my living hell seems so much more calmer when you are around. I watch while you are singing, proud of you...jumping up and down saying, did you see that? did you see that?   I hurt while you are hurting and I'm sorry he still breaks your heart time and time again. The painful tears you cry when you are tired of the world makes me hurt too. Fathers are a weird specimen on their own aren't they? Don't let him take you down silly, don't shy away.  You are enough and complete as a person. Your dreams are still there just like they were before. You make me a better person, having you by my side teaches me I am worth it. I tell you these things, begging you to constantly believe me yet I violate your trust too when you mention his name. When you bring up pain I turn around with spite and bitch.  I'm healing though, and I know you see it too. One day, I knew I'd see just like you saw me too.  Thankyou.    "she made me a sandwich she walked with me she let me touch her fingertips..."
