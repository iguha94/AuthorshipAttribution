         lol, i just had a weird moment?  hm..franklin and i have one class together. creative writing. and in that class, it's like a bitch fest. you basically take everyone's work and tear it apart and feed it to the dogs and bitchslap each other left, right and center.  martha is also in this class.  martha is my administrative coordinator. see, people that work on campus are allowed to take classes there as well. so it's very strange to have someone like your teacher come down to your level in class and have to critique their shit.   well anyway, martha calls.  it is very scary when martha calls because as nice and wonderful as a person she is, she has also the power to deport me back to malaysia. very very scary.  hell no am i leaving bloody fuck nowhere pensacola now.  but anyway, she wants to know if i'll swing by her office on monday.  i don't know bout you but a million red bulbs are ringing off in my head.  holy fuck what have i done now?  but she says she'd like to work with me on my latest assignment because apparently it is good.  i want to laugh.  because in that class i have been reduced to tears definitely more than once without anyone knowing. except the obvious of course but that's an entire different story completely.  my stories are shit. i am not a writer. i don't write well. i suck at english. and my grammar can go kiss my big fat hairy yellow behind.  so that was a nice interesting phonecall.  and now i'm all weirded out.  remind me again to tell you about this class, boy are there some fucking interesting stories to tell about that damn stupid moronic dumb class.  people are weird.  very weird.  oh wait, shit, i'm in that class.
