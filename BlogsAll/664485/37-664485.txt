           my   host  is an amazing person...i don't tell him very often but once in a while, when i'm feeling lovey and nauseated, i write posts like this to tell him he's special. :)  besides, who else ass am i going to kick in literati and share gory bits of 'paramedics' with?  or yell about my day and expect him to fix the site when i've shoved it up my ass and churned out broken links and garbled html?  and who else can i go to to share the feeling of sweet ecstacy as you sit back and enjoy that fucking well earned drink and  malboro  salem light?  i think he's a cool guy...and i'm very very happy he's back.  :)   "[5/25/2002 5:14:29 AM | chris raettig] once there lived a village of creatures along the bottom of a great crystal river. each creature in its own manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom, for clinging was their way of life, and resisting the current what each had learned from birth. but one creature said at last, "i trust that the current knows where it is going. i shall let go, and let it take me where it will."   p/s: i think   she  is a hot sexy amazing chick too....but don't tell anyone i said that. she might find out and kick my fat ass. :P   p/p/s   girls suck!   (....but men are still evil anyway! )
