            i have dreams of you. sometimes i lie awake in the middle of the night fighting of tears and nausea, but all is good i still say, all is good. i wonder if the sometimes nightmares, sometimes dreams, are trying to tell me anything at all, or if, like maybe you and me, they were just a friction of my imagination. maybe, perhaps, i don't know really. back to moving on..  people tell me things. sometimes i think it's because i seem to have this cloak that makes them figure that there is nothing that they can tell me that i would have never heard before. i don't flinch, don't blink..and when all is done, smile and produce more reassuring hugs and offer another round of coffee. but i lie.  i am afraid.  i hurt me, and beat myself up, and starve abuse myself but that's just me and that's okay.   i don't know. it doesn't make sense really but i want to protect everyone and all around me. but i can't...and that's scary.  i hate hate hate vulnerability.  i just want everyone to be okay and live happy ever after and see them the way i see them and realize how damn amazing they are.  you do know how precious you are right?     "I want to drink and dance and sing, with my friends, Rick's friends; I want to burn wood and smell the smoke and piss in the sea, shout at the moon, cry at the beauty of this world and swear eternal opposition to those who would paint it with blood, again, I want to hold you my friends in my arms and circle around our wounded brother and sing and weep and shout and break the shell of the words. I'm drunk again, by god, and I'm typing with tears running down my rugged goddamn manly cheeks, and I feel so useless. I want to bellow in pain like some big dumb beast, and I want to hold my friend and tell him that he has nothing to fear."     rest in peace rick.
