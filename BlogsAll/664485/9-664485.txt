           empty.                          "no one said it was going to be easy, no one said you won't wake up on days where you will feel like screaming your head off because it's so frustrating and no one said there won't be days where everything will hurt so bad and so you'll just cry and cry and cry somemore. no one said it was going to be easy. but there is hope. and hope is beautiful."   i took a walk alone tonight. just me. it was dark outside, darker than usual, gloomy, i was gloomy. i was down, for some reason. just not in my best spirits. the street lights were out, the moon looked terrible. i walked fast fast faster sometimes, and then others slow slow slowing stopping stride. only it wasn't really a stride. it was a just one more step, just a couple of streets more, just a while longer..you're okay ones.  i took pictures. nothing came out right..it frustrated me, so i walked somemore.   i looked and peeped into other people's lives. i watched the kids play. i smelled the staleness in the air. i passed by the candles lit up for the funeral on the next street. i looked up to the heavens, the clouds, my most favorite thing in the world but there was nothing. only plain cloudless skies. only a half heartedly shining moon. only an empty street.   i looked inside. i searched for the person i was inside but i was empty, i was tired. i was drained from all of today's going ons. i was hurting and holding back the tears that threatened to flow. i was holding on and keeping strong, humming my desolate tune. breaking me it wailed...breaking me.   upload the pictures. write another post. go on away.  i have emails to write. phone calls to make. a bathe to take. things to do.  but for this very moment, i am just curled up in my little corner letting the tears free.  i cannot be strong tonight.  i am only me.   just stupid retarded me..and i am hurting.   just having a bad day.     "If I am not free to fail, I'm not free to take risks, and everything in life that's worth doing involves a willingness to take a risk and involves the risk of failure...I have to try, but I do not have to succeed."
