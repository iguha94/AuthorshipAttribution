          things happen if you try..     hmm..i just woke up.   i strongly, do not at all, recommend running on an hour and a half of sleep a day.  rehersals came out fucktastically late last night because of the run through with the orchestra, we're doing costumes tonight then adding make up tommorow and hopefully, the show should kick ass by friday.  i have to say though, it's been really nice to have him around during breaks; sanity prevailing and comforting so it's good. i guess? :P  we're trying to keep it open, fun and getting to know each other right now, sometimes, when we're walking there's this strange feeling that makes me feel like i've known him forever but it's interesting.  bill came to one of our rehersal's one night and brought me a sweater i apparently left in his place...nevermind the fact that he's from uwf and won't stop ringing..stalker alert? uhuh.   it's always nice to watch the guys get it on and turn on a notch, sorta silly though but the semi confrontation was fun. at least on my part anyway.  private number good.   :P  over the last week i think i've pretty much managed to wrap my past in a little ribbon and tie and packaged it neatly into the corner. it did sorta hurt and make me cry a little, (okay, maybe a lot) but it's all good because i think i've walked away from this a better person, stronger.  friendship runs it's test and sometimes you win, sometimes you lose eh?  kick me hard if i start feeling sorry for myself again, i can get kinda wrapped around my fat arse sometimes.  well anyway, i need to go take a shower and put on some warmer clothes...note to winter: kiss my yellow behind.  :P   p/s the server is expected to continue having pms throughout the week or so...so, uhm, have fun? sorry!    "in short; i think i've largely got my head around the evolving idiosyncracies of the medium. sometimes i still get burnt. i definitely get the balance wrong sometimes. but i tread the line as best i can."
