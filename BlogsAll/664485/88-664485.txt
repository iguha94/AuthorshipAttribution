         You tell me I’m oblivious to beauty…that my four walls of security has confined me. And I blush, stumble over explanations and words, hell bloody shit why am I shy now?   Things are changing in my life, things I cannot predict nor really visualize. At times, it feels as if I am falling and leading myself into bigger trouble, slapping myself in the face with more warts and wounds to cloud my judgment. I am my own being, whatever my decisions, determine the outcome; all my actions are of my own right and doing. I cannot put the blame on others anymore, I must take responsibility….but damn, that is a big load.  I am equipped with different gifts. Talents they say. But many times I have felt as if it was all just a show, a façade, because many times I have failed. My grades come from hard work and the shows honed from countless hours of practice…precision even. It does not come easy, the different languages a barrier…translation goes on in my mind…I feel retarded. Disabled almost.  But I am not. I am whole in being and breathing. Heart beating and life living. I am here and my moments are being executed and made, every second of my life is being recorded in some book above…will I live my life without regrets?  I am a person. I am a being with feelings and emotions…perhaps even at times, way too much sensitivity points. I am person that can be beautiful, can be something, can be someone. Sometimes I want to say I just need you or someone to believe in me, and I catch myself constantly evaluating the people around me, not realizing that all the insecurity lies within. I make my own person, it is me that needs to believe in me and me that needs to know that I can do it. That I am someone to somebody and have so much more ahead of me. Is life gorgeously enthralled in ecstacy? Hell no. but it is quite damn close to at times…the times that I  believe.     "I've never been this happy about someone proving me wrong. "
