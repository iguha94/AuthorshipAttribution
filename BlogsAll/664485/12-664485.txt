           check-mate.                  i wonder if everyone at church feels like the sermon was specifically meant for them or if it's just application or if the pastor was just good at it?  i.  feel.  like.  typing.  like.  this.  why?  because.  it's  irritating.  isn't.  it?  okay, i'll stop now. :P  i'm going to laugh.  ha ha ha ha ha.  see, funny.  :P  i think the heat is affecting my mind.  it's become hot again. no wait, scrap that, it's become very very unbelievably crazily insanely my flesh is burning hot again.  i have a pretty black silk skirt on.   i like it cause it's flowy wiggly.  and nice and shiny but not hookery type retarded.  i can't remember when i bought it.  good buy though.  yay.  i saw a lovely ring yesterday.  it was only 16, 000 ringgit.  which is only about six months of working.  damn.  dah-yum.     and i don't even work anymore.  this is not good.  i think i lost my cell phone too.  because i can't find it.  i've rang it but it's on silent so i can't hear it.  maybe if i put my head to the floor i'll feel the vibration.   maybe i left it in another bag.  maybe someone stole it.  maybe it walked away.  maybe, i don't know maybe.  it was a nice phone though.  a good phone.  rest in peace little phone.   i'm bored, can you tell?  the sermon was good though.  tell you about check-mate later.  i'm too busy kicking jeremy's literati ass.  wa ha ha ha ha   :P     "purple monkey dishwasher."
