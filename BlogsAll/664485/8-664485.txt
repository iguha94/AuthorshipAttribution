           faceless.                         appearance and reality...i find it all too easy and available to simply mask and be... the person i am is multi layered, exposing the different textures in me that can exist. does that make me shizo? does that make me assholic? does that make me indecisive? perhaps so, but it also makes me comfortable.   yet there are times like today, when i look and see and laugh cynically yet ironically at the person i am on the outside and inside. i laugh because it is funny that things can be misinterpreted so and judgement crosses the path i walk on already molded and formed. i cracked up rereading   my testimonial  today, i wonder if perhaps she had seen me inside if everything i have ever achieved mattered. things look too perfect on the outside, too put together. she writes only a couple each year, specifically for the over achievers. how in the hell am i one of them?  then i laugh at me. i laugh because i am a walking talking breathing joke. such a fucking farce...yet i am not angry anymore. i was bitter, angry, and assholic before about having too many facades and having too many faces, i can only accept them now as how i am. this is my version of honesty.  a friend told me once that as long as i was comfortable in my skin, i could be whoever and whatever i wanted to be. selfishness sometimes too is an important part of survival. i take the brickbats, just like i take the backstabs, i take the compliments just like i take the criticism, i take days and hours and weeks away from reality, just like i take those times manifesting in it. i take what i can get for it is me.  i am not sorry that i was upset yesterday, for it made me a better person today. so often we focus on what's easily available, easily conquered, choosing simple over better.   i challenge you to choose difficult. i challenge to change something in you that you've needed to change a while. i challenge you to climb that mountain, cross that sea, swim that ocean. i challenge you to be yourself. just you.   fuck whoever and whatever else. if nobody loves you for just you than there is no point at all.  no, this is not a i'm mad at him because he wants me to be someone i'm not retaliation but rather a i'm me and i can only be me and i will be me no matter how many faces i put up and how many different walks i'll go though for in the end it is just me and so you can only love me for me and not love me but want me to be someone else type of thing.   if that made sense.   :P  nice long understanding working out talks are good.   in other news though, i only had one extra jab today so it was nice..and the kids are doing really really well and we're making shirts next week! :)  you doing good?     "But she felt she truly saw some of his depth that night. She understood so much more. Things she once thought were frivolous suddenly made sense to her. And that was the moment she knew what he could do for her. He could love her, comfort her, keep her safe & warm.... but more than anything he could show her how to feel alive again. "
