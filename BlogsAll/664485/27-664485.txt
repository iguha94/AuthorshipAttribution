         my day started out brilliant with my sun roof deciding to fuck up on me then subsequently, rain. yes, it's crazy ass hot for a good whole week and the one day my sun roof decides to die on me it bloody rains. damn, i must  really  be pissing off someone above.   ahh..but that will not deter me for i went in (afuckinggain!) to get stabbed. :) of course i just squeezed my eyes super tight and chanted and chanted and chanted till they stuck everything in and we played video games till it was over. all good honey! i'm not really sure what todays session was for though, because unlike yesterday where i was anally sensitive, today, the voices in my head blocked the doctors whatever out completely. i also happen to have that god damn bishi bashi theme song in my head i swear i'm going insane.   we're starting on me lungs on monday. oh hell yeah this is going to be fun.   :P  in other news though, it's a friday night!  grace wants to go get dinner at some new place she found.  my brother wants to go clubbing.  chris wants to go for some short film festival blah thing downtown.  auntie jesse wants me to go for cg. (mmhmm)  steve wants me to make chicken soup. lol :P  and i...want to go to bed.   i'm sleeeeeepppyyyyyy.  why the hell do i have a feeling that i will do none of the above?     "No.. I am not just busy, I am in Hell!! If I am ABLE to pull all this off without a hitch, it is impossible that I am human!"
