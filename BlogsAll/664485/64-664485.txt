         I’m busy, busy, busy it’s not even funny. Hell you try maintaining eighteen credit hours, getting fit, keeping the social ‘in’, staying sane and doing the whole movie thing. It’s interesting, crazy ass hectic and tiring as stitch but all good honey!  Auditions on Monday was just absolutely beautiful…the director seemed really nice and it was the best feeling walking out of there knowing I kicked ass. You know how racheal’s confidence level gets but dahyum, that was a good audition. :P  It’s funny how people try to hide how excited they are and mask it with all the talk and crap and you’re sitting there just thinking, hell yeah, you want me don’t you? * giggle *  I do have to say though that being Asian helped seeing as I didn’t see too many other Asians audition for Thai’s part and it is supposed to be apparently written for an Asian girl but I won’t get too excited. :P  It’s nice to feel so happy though. Proud, like I did something right and it feels really good!  Whoop. Whoop.  Now, to memorize those two damn monologues, 55 pages of homework and dinner tonight.   Hehe, god I’m delirious like a little school girl!  :P  I can’t begin to tell you how good it feels to be smiling again after that god of all fuckers week I had…we did this whole new approach with Gayle last night and that whole social stigma thing about seeing a therapist? I can only say that up yours because if I get to figure out as much as I did last night and feel as good as I do now, I’ll deal with it!  :)     "Our bodies are made for pleasure.
