           love you.                       dear che che,  just wanted to tell you that i'll miss you so much. thank you for being the che che i never had, for all the good, bad and fantastic times. love you.  kisses, mei mei.   she taught me how write my name in chinese. how to speak in a horrible irish accent. helped me design my prom dress. braided my hair and tucked me in at night. she's loved me all these years and been there for me in the typical asian subtility(is there such a word?)   she flies back to belfast again tonight. she's officially a mrs now. gonna have cute little semi irish babies. gonna eat chips and vinegar again.  went shopping today. says she'll fly in from london for my birthday. it's my eighteen. thinks i'm special enough and worth it. makes me want to cry.   miss her already. words are so hard between us. we have to stop crying, can only hug and cry some more..it's absurd. she tells me to be good. tells me to take care. i tell her all the things i'm supposed to tell her. and with that she is gone. we wave and stand there a while, just till after she's passed the dreaded customs. she's on a flight tonight. alone. waiting to meet her husband again. she is happy yet sad. i am..i don't know what i am. i am missing her.  have a safe flight home.
