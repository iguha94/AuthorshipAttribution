         No sunlight pierces through, only the sharp stinging ice drops falling. It is bleak and somber, slow…as if almost melodramatic surrealness. I’d like to believe the world stopped turning a while, took a break too…teardrops from heaven they say; why is god crying?   “God because you look at everything and still smile,”   Surprisingly very sober now, flashes of last night makes breaks her into a smile. Their little rendezvous into forbidden land, rolls of raw fish consumed washed away with laughter and good company. Twirling around, she is dancing.  She feels good and bad at the same time, the cold doesn’t help. Her bones ache as she shivers, curls up closer to the fireplace but it’s okay, she reminds herself. As always, things will be right.  All these people coming and going in her life; bad pick up lines that make her giggle and charm that makes her blush. It’s interesting to see how the animals devour their meat, fend off allies that become equal predators….basic human instinct. Fight.  But she sits at the sidelines and observes. Poor silly things, she’s not looking; does that mean she’s leading them on? No, she’s been quite clear about it, she remembers, yet some part of her can’t help but wonder why his hands finds hers as she jokingly yanks it away and wags her finger.   Cock teaser.     It’s Thursday.  …and I know that apprehension. That anxious feeling that makes you want to run.              Especially when everyone who “knows” says you have to do what you don’t do. And you know you don’t – so why don’t they know you know?  ‘Cause sometimes what we know – we don’t.  It’s just talking.              Blogging out loud.  To a stranger’s face that, let’s face it – you might never see again anyway.  Don’t be too smart. (You are sometimes – and you know that.) Too smart “for your own good” – whatever the fuck that is.  It’s just talking.  So talk. You dazzle when you talk. You impress without pressing too hard.  By the time you leave…they’ll know why you’re so confused sometimes.  (Laugh as you drive away…now it’s their problem!)  Love you      you remembered;  .....thank you.       "The most seemingly difficult decisions to make are actually quite easy. Once you make the decision it seems natural and you wonder why it was ever so difficult to decide in the first place."
