           someone said drama?         Because I know you like crazy ass maid stories and laughing at me is always good for you :P   So crazy maid two decided to poison my mom today. With her spit.  Absolutely disgustingly abhorringly revolting. * blech *  See, crazy maid two is a bit senile and retarded and so today, when my mom told her that she did not need to go grocery shopping with nice maid one, she flipped…vehemently insisting that it was of national crisis that she went. My mom of course told her that it was not and that she should just continue doing whatever maidly things she was doing and obey as she was told because that’s what a good maid does right? She listens to her commands. (I feel like god now btw :P)  Then because she’s in charge of making breakfast she  brings  slams my mom her coffee and whatever else and my mom, thankfully, notices a gob of congealed phlegm floating ever so serenely on her nice black coffee. My mom looks at it kinda in disbelief and then tells her to pack her bags.  Lol, it would have been funny had it not been spit and had it not been my maid but considering it is my maid, and it was spit, I can only find this funny ten hours later.   Crazy maid starts yelling and screaming and spitting all over the damn place and all this drama begins of course when I naively, sleepily and regretfully come down to the dining room for what I thought would be just another boring stupid day. Picture me, in my nice bright red pants and all my glory, stepping into the room, nonchalantly going to my seat and then this whole explosion of fury and words and body fluids. Oh yes, it was a great morning indeed.   Nice maid then comes over and kind of protects me because at this point crazy maid is really starting to flip and she’s is screaming. And I mean really screaming. Like seven hundred and sixty five decibels screaming about anything and everything in a flurry of English, Malay and Indonesian and just really flipping. And I’m still trying to figure out, what the fuck?  The guards of course then come running down because of all this inhuman screaming that is coming from the house and then uncle ahmad kinda like restrains her with the rest of them. I swear I felt like I was in a fucking movie. Then suddenly, crazy maid changes tactics and starts crying. Bawling. Sobbing. Begging. She goes mmmaaaaammmmmmmmm, then she goes kaakkk rraacchhhheeaaaallll, then she goes ssssiiiiiiirrrrr and I’m all like, Get. Away. From. Me.   Scariness.  Then of course we find out later that she had to see some guy at the market and that she’d been seeing him for a while now and that they’ve been going out together. I look at my bed and I pray to god nothing happened there. Then we also find out that she’s been giving away our things to the other maids and the other dude as well to sell or use and that she’s also been having parties for the rest of the neighborhood maids on Sundays when we’re at church and sneaking whoever and whatever lunch and dinner…I wonder if theirs were laced with spit as well.   But the worst thing is not knowing if all this while I have been eating my maid’s spit. Nice maid does all the cooking and evil crazy maid is in charge of helping her to prepare though. I’m almost glad I throw up what I eat because this suddenly makes me even more sick. Then if I really wanted to mess things up further I could conclude that it was all a conspiracy by the nice maid because we have previously screwed her in her past life and so crazy maid has been framed. Of course then I’d also believe that I saw purple spotted cows today….but then again.   So that’s another crazy stupid evil maid story for you to be stored into the archives of the out to get racheal list.    Madness.      "I'd slap you but shit splatters."
