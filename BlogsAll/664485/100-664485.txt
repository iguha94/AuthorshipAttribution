         you know, there's nothing like going to the medicine cabinet and finding it empty.  time to go play hide and seek...  or lock and keep?  whatever really.  i've decided i'm going out tonight....i have five places to go to...two in which i don't really care for but have to.  i want to go take a long bath and start getting ready...but there is this imminent fear in having to look myself in the mirror and being afraid i might not be so okay later..  taking a bath normally also means a lot of things..sure, i figure i could just fuck myself and give myself a good time in steaming hot bubbly candle atmosphere...but why the fuck do people have to get naked to take a bath?  i wish i just didn't need to see myself, and just ignore. not feel so overweight and ugly and disgust myself.  why. why. why.  the odd thing is that i'm sleeping over at the girlfriend's house tonight. and she has all these things planned for us..i just feel so numb and sorta blah right now.  i'm not depressed though, just unfeeling.  my choice of music isn't exactly helping either..come on, melloncollie and the infinite sadness?...dumbass.  i had a really  beautiful  fucktastic conversation with the old guy tonight though...kissing and making up is fun. painful but really nice..  and for some really odd reason, the new major and i ended up having lunch then went shopping together. very interesting. nice though..i enjoyed it anyway..  hm..time to make voodoo cutouts of the ex...  bitter? me?  hell no.
