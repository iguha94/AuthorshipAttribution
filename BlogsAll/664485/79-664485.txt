         I used to be a writer…an artist. I used to sit and type for hours and hours, reliving tales and baring my soul. I was less cynical then, more opinionated then worried about being exposed. Art was my means of expression and so daily, I wrote in thoughts and opinions, daily, my feelings were transcribed into words, my moods captured in slides and the very  core of my being dictated my strides. My strokes. The beauty of heavy, wet paint brushed onto a white, clean canvas.   Free to be explored and altered, free to be manipulated and created. Free to do anything for everything was in my hands.   I was nimble and open, but years passed by and made me older. More cynical. Less forgiving. The shitless porcelain vase that stands broken thinly held together by only a film of adhesive...I am that vase that borders on insecurity. Will I fall and break and like Humpty-Dumpty not be able to put the pieces back together? Or will I waver between both sides and always be saved right before? Right before I crash and burn and fall like China cups on cold, wet, tiled floor…guaranteed them smithereens.  Stroke me.   Very gently, rub my back. Touch me. Get inside of me.  Make sweet, hard, soft, passionate love to me.   Don’t touch me.       "There i sat, bleeding thumb held back away from my hand in an attempt to forget that it was conveniently opposable, pressing together the clay i had just so painstakingly cut apart."
