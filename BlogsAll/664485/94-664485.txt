         i picked up a box of oil-based crayons today.  you know, the type with vivid colors that merge quite nicely together but leave your fingers greasy and speckly?  :)  wal*mart trips at two in morning after a waffle house session with everyone and their mothers is great. stupid, silly, retarded and definitely unproductive but there's a distinct feeling of pure utter joy in watching your friends pull up rather coincidentally and having made friends with the table next door that just so happens to be friends of a friend. it's a small world indeed.  as the old man pulls up a chair next to the giggling bobsy twins and escapades are rehashed and retold. colored brightly and painted into someone else's world, the jukebox slammed with quarter after quarter of late eighties gold her father taught her to listen to, country bumpkin crap she's learned to appreciate and a host of pop songs she's too embarrassed to buy cds of.  i just killed my streak of eight wins. i fell asleep.  yes, my literati ass crayoning at this obscene hour just dozed off lying on the floor with my fluffy soft pillow.  well, that sucks. but oh well.  i'll get over it.  :)  scattered around are 'expressions', they call it 'art', i call it boredom at five am and a fascination with colors.   inspired.  so i had this phone conversation today....  :P
