          night falls.  i wonder what it would be like to kiss the sky and dance among the stars. floating hazily in between consciousness and swiftly  wading in between dreams. seeing people, faces; things i use to know but they don't connect. i recognize, but it is only familiar,  deja vu, but nothing significant. nothing i really  know .   good days and bad days. ups and downs. inside and out. open and in. honest and hiding. things will be okay, they have to be,  they must be.   i cry when i hear your voice, it tells me not to cry. your will to protect me pushes me away further, i am scared of life today...i  cannot do this. courage: what the fuck is that? no, but i am strong, i am strong, i am fine, i will get through this, i am always good,  i am fine, things will be right, it is okay.  i toss and turn wanting and forcing my mind to shut down and sleep but i feel the tears well up behind my eyes and i hold tighter  and tighter, and breathe deeper and deeper, and then i let go. sob. again. why baby, why?  fanfuckingtastic show. perfect. utter brilliance. but i don't see your face. i don't get your congratulatory hug. i don't get your laugh  that rings in my ear, i don't hear your voice, i don't see your face.   i am alone.  auditorioum. people. friends. dates.  still alone.   but i wanted this didn't i?  un-attached. single. open relationship, hell yeah.  but still alone.   and that's good right?
