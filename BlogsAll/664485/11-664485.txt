           ready for the world (again).        i really should be banned from blogging at this hour.  i think too much for my own good too.  my new found tom friend is cool. he   writes  pretty damn good.  i made a huge mistake the other night. guilt is definitely not my good friend.   five player scrabble games are cool.  my test results come out on wednesday. i hope i don't need another jab or course of something. it is such a pain to be sick.  i am such a whiny little brat.  it is hard to end a game when you are stuck with all vowels.  i have to bribe the literati gods.  pop tarts at two in the morning make me laugh.  i'm sleepy.  i have a long rant in my head but it won't come out.   i really talk too much for my own good.  my dad's throwing me a party.  i don't really want a party.  sheesh.  and on a more serious note..  i've noticed lately that a lot of bloggers seem to be coming clean. i did that today. i gave an old friend the blog address because she asked if i still had that thing online. i really wasn't sure how she would take it, i am anticipating that she might take it really badly, not because of what i've said here but rather the connection of racheal in the real world and racheal online.   i've struggled lately, to really sorta come to bring them together. that comfortable place where i do not need to pretend nor am i insecure with how much i am revealing.    and it. is. Hard.   i wonder if i want to give out this address to people in my real world. my mom used to read my old blog, i think it was too painful for her but today, she asked me again if it was okay if she came and read this one. i haven't answered her, i don't really think i can prevent her from coming in. it is more of like a trust thing, she knows i will know if she came in here and all i have hanging on it is her word to not come in here and read what i have to say unless i'm okay with it.  i guess i'm really sorta overprotective then. because this really is my baby. i designed it, i made it, i pored over it but most of all, everything inside here is a mirror image of me. i know every nook and corner and what it represents. i have found writing to be my best tool of honesty for faces can decieve and lie.   i am slightly shaken and unsure about this but yet the trepiditation(sp?) of being free to be who i am and what i am excites me. i vowed in my old blog to only write for me but then as the numbers increased and as i began to realize that my written word affected people i started censoring myself. i really hope that does not happen again.  i do not want to use my blog to hurt people. i have done it countless other times before. because writing is mostly my safe place and writing it out is how i make sense of the situation, me using the words that formed sentences onto the screen through my mind at that very moment has made a mark and causes a reaction or a significant effect.   i want this to be a medium of self discovery yet i also wish for it to be a platform for the things i believe in. i like meeting new people and the brilliant new and old friendships that have formed and bonded through this medium has never ceased to amaze me. i am thankful and grateful yet there are times where i wish i could turn back the hands of time and begin again.  i can't but can only turn over this chapter and rewrite my story.  will you rewrite it with me please?  jared and i talked. it hurt but things are starting to look up again, it's ended yet this is a good ending. i think i'm beginning to like life again...now isn't that scary?     "but there's nothing wrong with that. its your site.  you can write long stuff if you want.  you can write short stuff if you want.  you can write 'cheese' in six inch high letters if you want."
