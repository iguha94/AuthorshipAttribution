                                             i figure this cannot possibly be good for me; i am currently running on two hours of sleep, caffienated diet pills, homework, homework and homework, rehersals, school and attempting somewhat a social life. fuck the hell yeah.  i also attempted to quit smoking somewhere in between the hours of seven last night and three this morning. very bad idea. cranky grumpy sleep deprived racheal without nicotine? evil almost. :P  i'm tired. no wait, tired doesn't even come close to it, i'm bloody ass exhausted. pooped. dead. whatever you fancy really.   though i really like life right now, i just wish it'd give me some proper time to enjoy it. don't get me wrong though, it's still dandy and i'm still going out, still dating (LAUGH), still doing fun stuff, still socializing but oh my god.  i also need to find a halloween costume.   i think i'll go as a prostituite.   which reminds me, i find out last night that one of my costumes is a freaking corset. damn.   racheal? corset? disgusting.   so i'm on a diet for the next six weeks till the show is over. this is going to be fun....especially since my main meal of the day happens at two in the morning at waffle house.   but hey, living for me and doing what i want right?  bring it on, you assholes of fate and beauties of life, bring it on.   grrr.  :P    "Writing free verse is like playing tennis with the net down."    p/s the other post dissappeared!! don't ask me how...it's a conspiracy i swear!
