         About five minutes ago, I was horny. Now I'm just trying to stay the fuck rational. Hell knows I don't want to go to sleep crying tonight, after all, the Muse is happy tonight right? Was anyway.  Mind against Heart.  Don't let it get to you, let it go.  It's not worth it damnit, it's not worth it.   I try to remember all that was said in yesterday's session, how blatantly honest I had become in those few minutes. I found all the answers I had been looking for, subconsciously knowing they were within, perhaps just not knowing where to look.  Perfect tore away at Passion, I like all the parts I had talked about changing. Essentially a good person really, just gets too carried away. Guarded now, Control has to lay frigid hands to rule, keep in check. Never try free falling again, why pick away at old scabs?  A test. A measurement to see how far you've come...Sorry some day. Tommorow, Yesterday or next Week? Forgiveness is a key to Kindness, she tells me Mind needs to be gentle with Heart. That the insecure messed up person in me is really okay; that session scared me. Opened me.  The initial high came crashing down at   Marc's , thoughts jumbled up and a meal desperately attempting to be digested. Palm on skin, tumor beneath flesh, sanity prevailing sinking on the line.  My insecurities can bite my ass, tonight I am Enough.  Tomorrow I am Beautiful.  Forever I am Special.  I believe that, I think I might really.   I am good enough, strong enough, Enough.  and I won't let you convince me again I'm not  ...even if you still Hurt me  Tear me apart, feed me to the wolves;  So I am evil, so I am bad, so I am all the things you constantly tell me I am, so what?  at least I am still Fighting, and I will still hang on to my Dreams.  You have no idea how precious these dreams are to me...Life.      "let it go-the smashed word broken open vow or the oath cracked length wise-let it go it was sworn to              go   let them go-the truthful liars and the false fair friends and the boths and neithers-you must let them go they were born              to go   let all go-the big small middling tall bigger really the biggest and all things-let all go dear             so comes love"
