          “her ex boyfriend (the one who treated her like shit no less, raped her, and dumped her when she had cancer)” Familiar?    I am immortalized by his being, his words ignite fire in me. Translucent and clinging to the air I breathe, clasping on fluidly to gentle words, lips forming sounds, coherent thoughts, indecision, and conflict. Drama, bigger than life itself, I smile.  Sexual tension is beautiful. Selfish, but giving, Frustrated, but understanding, so everything not only harbors on Lust…don’t want to strip again, don’t want anyone to come close.    I am angry. Incredibly frustrated with myself, my being. Not able to forgive and still affected ; he breaks me down again. He pierces through the layers the others have helped heal and stabs again. The tears fall, against my will, swipe away…swipe away…fall. You’re not worth it. And that’s all that’s left chanting in my mind, nevermind how far I’ve come, his disapproving, debilitating stare has gunned me down. Pawn.    He holds me, hugs me. Rubs my back when my heart pounds, pounds, pounds against my will. As if it will explode any second and my chest contracts beyond all pain imaginable and I cry. I scream inside but physically too scrunched up to do anything. Only these attacks tell me I am still alive, only these attacks tell me I still have a heart. I cling on to comfort, but shield away from security. I’ll build my own walls, thank you very much, I’ll fight my own battles. Alone.     I am left in the center. The beginning of an ending that feels shortchanged. We are prisoners locked in our own worlds, but yet he chooses to take my key…or maybe I gave it away too soon. Or maybe I’ve lost it forever. He’ll always hold it won’t he? He grins. Superior power in his hands ; and he knows it. That ability, the one he questioned me about, Revenge. Ego. Submission.     We drive. We drive for hours and hours, on long winding roads, and half assed bumpy paths only to find ourselves on this never ending journey. I have found a friend, I have found someone that cares, loves…but I cannot seem to love him.  I let him in, but with every brick that I take down, four goes back up. It’s as if with everything emotional, everything that constitutes thoughts and a heart; I take one step forward and twelve steps back.      I throw sticks and stones. Wanting to turn my back and not care when he’s hurting, not be bothered when he questions.  I remember Christmas, and New Year. I remember he is selfish and unforgiving, spiteful and indifferent. That he hates me and I deserve better, deserve someone who loves, believes, trusts in me.      Go Away. Run. Leave. Let Go. Search. Move on…whatever.    It’s as if God looks down and mocks me. Irony spears through and little boys and little girls of every type and nature feed off this insecure, broken, extremely confident, happy, sad, crazy aura that surrounds me. I am beautiful in disharmony, strong in breaking down.  Attractive? Scary.  I’m indecisive, I don’t want to make decisions…commitments. I run,  and even they know it.    Just thinking out loud.         "The sounds of water, it sings to me; the smell of water, the fragrance refreshes my soul; the silky soft current weave in and out and in and out gracefully from between stones, I’ll never forget that beauty. I laugh, I smile, I drop the pretty wild flowers in my hand, I dip my fingers into the cool water, when I look up at you again, and you’re gone already."
