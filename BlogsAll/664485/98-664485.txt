         waiting for another outlook..dressed again..somehow i've never put together this 'look' before and it gives me a very 'la-la' feeling...i've mixed some knits and cotton with a pair of pin-striped slacks..my hair's tied up in that messy attempting to be sexy look and i have these silver hoop earrings on. i can't decide between heels or mules and the make up says casual, gothic and bitchy at the same time.  perhaps this is what it's all about...reinventing yourself...being able to put on a 'facade' with whatever you have in your closet.  new major said the other day of the outfit, the one that screamed 'look up, please'...it was a just over the knee length dress, with this tying strings..choker like crap..and i'd put on a white one shoulder shirt on. it was 'artistic' but was it to call attention...be different? or was it just cause i wanted to feel 'pretty' that day?  i walked into 'gap'  yesterday and realized what a fucking shopaholic i was. everything i picked up, i'd seen before and the boys knew me by first name basis. i stepped out depressed and to a certain point, almost ready to cry. frustrated with myself.   i have such little control over my finances and it's pathetic how unthrifty i am. my concept of money should be flushed down the drain...i want to blame my upbringing but i realize this discipline shit and being responsible can only be up to me. my parents can only live so long and no matter how many millions, there are crude people out there and within me. irresponsible and just shitty with it, i'm tired of being the spoiled fucked up brat you know?  i don't know...it's a saturday and shit like this should not be psycho-analyzed.  the girl just arrived...we're staying at the beach house this weekend. just to 'get away from it all' or something. on a tornado watch...that's smart..  too many thoughts but i'll write it down later..gotta pack.
