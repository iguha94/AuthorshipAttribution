           bodoh.                            blogger  hates me.   or so i think.  that or it has a very sick sense of humor.  ...or maybe i played too much with my template and it got tired of editing and publishing and editing and publishing and editing and publishing and oh well, you know..  or maybe it's just angry with me and i've somehow overloaded it with so much of rubbish html codes and i've somehow stringed together in what seemed like codes but weren't really real codes and were just a result of racheal thinking it was a code when it really wasn't a code.   but then of course i only came to this conclusion after i changed computers. three times. because heaven forbid should the ever efficient and user friendly blogger have a nervous breakdown.   so i took a diskette, a great big effort in itself because who the hell in this house uses a diskette when you can just burn it into a cdr. well not me said i. and so after looking in between cracks of bookshelves and under my bed and in my drawers and all around the bloody room, i finally found one. a virused one that is. because largely emblazoned on it in tip ex was 'retarded'. my room is 22x75, and you'd think that with everything packed up and with all of that bloody space that i'll find at least one unvirused diskette right? well apparently, i was wrong. because i ended up going next door and asking for a diskette, which of course brought on the whole cdr issue. again. for the six hundred and seventy second time.    but i'll get back to my point again.  so i take my diskette, and copy my files and label them and that's all fine and dandy till i bring it to the other computer. everything loads and opens up nicely till stupid   blogger  gives me an error message. again. of course, any normal person with a brain would have figured out that hey, maybe blogger's just acting up. but nooooo, i have to be convinced that is my freaking computer and connection. so what do i do?  i use the laptop.   only that the laptop needs a password.  and i can't for the bloody life of me remember the darn thing.   i tried  shit . then i tried  hairy   . then i tried  stupid  and  slut  and  dumb  and  moronic  and  love  and lastly, even  god . i kid you not, at some point in time, those were actual passwords to accounts because every bloody thing needs a god damn password now doesn't it? and i can't bloody centralize it because see,  al ,  evan ,  jared ,  jasmine ,  kara  and  chris  have the blogger passwords so they can figure out whatever shit i've put in there that isn't working. and  bryan ,  tim ,    sakthi ,  chris  and  drew  have my email passwords because they send out emails for me or download them for me when i don't have time to or like the other day, change my passwords for me because i really should be banned from sending long annoying stupid emails which i will regret later. don't even get me started on the chain emails. and  steve  with  drew  has my work account password because god forbid, should i die or anything, he would know how to handle all the crap in there. then there's my phone password which half the world has and knows because..i don't actually know how they know but they just seem to. then there's the password for the house alarm, and the door alarm, and   various    other    chat    mediums  and so really if i were to centralize, would not nothing be just mine anymore? but then i have another rant stored for that and so i will continue on with this one...which is that with all these bloody passwords, how the hell am i supposed to remember what i put in for the password on the lap top considering i only use it when i'm taking a bath and feel like watching a movie, or late at night when my fat ass can't walk across the room to switch on the pc, or when i have to use a different line, or when i feel like it. in which i don't. because i don't know, it just doesn't work for me and i hate hate hate hate the mouse and can't stand the screen nor the keyboard but yeah, what's my fucking password?  so then admist all this i forgot to ring steve back to say that we'd go for the   mib  thing tonight. which was dumb and ignorant and insensitive of me because oh, we only planned on going to this thing since last month but well, i forgot. which is no excuse. so why didn't he ring instead? because when he did earlier i was asleep thanks to some pills i had to take for the thing last week and so he thought that i needed rest and that i didn't feel like going and let me sleep instead. doh.  and so, i still haven't watched   mib , i still can't access my template and i am still tired. minus the fact that i've slept for a good portion of today but yeah, whatever!  and so just now, when i sat down to write this, i remembered the bloody thing.   "dumbass."   i think i will shoot me now.   in other news though, i got some very cute pants fr   tommy  today. and my scanner works again. and i talked to   koren  at six in the morning because some people don't know how to plus eight hours. oh, and i had a popsicle for dinner. which was very very good. like a slushie cum popsicle cum orange tasting syrup thing. :) and i made a   few    new    friends  too. hm...that and   he's  bloody adorable. :P  now, if only i can get this damn template done.
