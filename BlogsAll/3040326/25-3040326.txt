So here we are, Thursday and I'm still suffering the effects of Leeds. That's the festival, not the city, although I did live in Leeds for a while back there, and it took a few years to recover from that experience, they like a drink in them parts! To be more specific, I haven't recovered from Friday night when The Hells strutted their wonderful stuff. After a horrendous journey of 6 and a 1/2 hours (twice as long as usual) we stumbled, crook backed from car seats, into The Hells dressing room wherein our dusty eyes beheld a veritable feast of booze. Artrockers, I lay into it like a man posessed, a very large bottle of vodka being my prime target, determined to cut it down to size. Of course this was a battle that the bottle was always going to win. Within a frighteningly short space of time I was doing the old wobbly walk, like a sailing boat running against the wind, I tack far over to the left on one leg, hit a wall and tack wildly to the right on the other leg till a hard surface is encountered. This walking technique is long winded and means that you walk at least 4 times as far as you need to in order to reach your destination. And when you do pitch up, half an hour later and a good 50 feet from your starting point, damned if you can remember why you wanted to go there in the first place. Best take a leak so as not to waste the journey and then start tacking back in the general direction of drunken voices. We've all done it at one time or another haven't we Artrockers? It's only human. The subtle difference here was that the whole thing was being filmed by the documentary team that's been following us around all year. Have you any idea how hard I've been working at portraying the correct, sober, image? And I blew the whole schmeer over one large bottle of Smirnoff. I need to find the contract, did we ask for 'final cut'? Hang on a second, not only is there no 'final cut' clause, there is no contract. We are trusting souls who beleive in community baby! Let's hope the film makers are of a similar mind set, that footage is dynamite, my fan base will be terribly disillusioned. I know this because I asked him. Apparently, and I'm not proud of this, unable to walk or even talk, I drove us all over to the camping grounds with Paul's hand hovering over the steering wheel. Many years ago, when you could still get away with it, I perfected a drunken driving technique that has never failed me, close one eye and the road stops wandering around in an unpredictable manner. This technique I now applied and, with an average speed of 1 mph, made it safe and sound to the tents. Which was the cue for Myshkin's Tequila to be unwrapped and for my memory to shut down, all else is blamk until I found myself, in the cool morning dew, fertilising a tree with the day before's food and drink. I felt fairly chipper after that, that's chipper as in not quite so fucked as I was. The rest of the day was viewed from the right side of a very dark pair of Aviators which did nothing for my cool factor, smeered as I was with puke and grass stains.  The fesival? Well, it was a festival wasn't it?, same as they ever are. It made a nice change from Reading though in that we could walk through the guest bar without wild eyed record company execs. leaping out and berating us for slagging off their latest Indie tossers. Speaking of whom, The Thrills are on the radio right now and Jack, quite rightly, asked who the hell likes this band. My answer was "old men who like a nice four part harmony because it reminds them of The Byrds or The Fannies or something like that - it reminds them of their youth!" Old and in the way, meet young and totally irrelevant.  Acoustic guitars are the work of the devil: discuss.  TOM ARTROCKER  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  CONTENTS.  1.  DELIA'S GIG GUIDE  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  1.  >>>DELIA'S GIG GUIDE  >Johnny Cash: How do I get to be him? Some music is so great that i can't really deal with listening to it. It jiggles through my veins as though i've got a drip putting it in intraveneously. I feel my skin crinkling and my fingers clenching trying to cope with the glory of pop. I dance around my room but can't go fast/slow/high/small/big enough. I shoot sparks of pop out of my fingernails and my hair falls out and re-attaches itself with frustration. when i am an old (er) lady i will be pushed around in a wheelchair (by sadistic jailers in debtors prison actually) and when i hear the faint echoes of tunes coming out of peoples windows you'll see my eyelashes flicker in get-up-dance desires.  >Soundtracks this week. Oh it's all gone Johnny Thunders. CAn't put your arms >around a memory.  What a tune. I kiss that tune. I put my arms around the memory of that tune whether Johnny likes it or not.  Also Angel Corpus Christi. Something about her voice makes you feel wistful and raw-hearted. Bleak is out and New York cool and Angel knows all about it. And The Violent Femmes. There's such good music out there. Forget about this weeks cool. Go and dig deep in your record collection (or someone else's) and rejoice in all that is great. Jubilations and salutations to all that is good and pure in pop. The greatness and perfection of pop can hit you in the face like a frying pan in a Tom And Jerry cartoon.  Johnny Cash: I'd even be a christian if i could be Johnny Cash.  R.I.P. Wesley Willis. 'Off-Kilter' , 'untoward' and well..let's face it...kinda bonkers. More blatant in having most of his songs sound quite similar than most bands admit to but if you've got such a genius song and such a great approach? well then that's okay. With songs about McDonalds and Urge Overkill and even (i had the great pleasure to witness..) about the Country Teasers he was  a one man tribute band. I am very privileged and proud to be able to tell that I met and headbutted with Wesley and he was a sweetheart. Where's like him? Not many and they're all dead....  Johnny Cash: He can and does sing anything and it sounds like the song they'll be playing when the end of the world comes.  >>>LAST WEEK  >Thursday:  A little tired....am djing for my friends singer-songwritery accordions/ melodica/ baby-jazz-drum kit bashing night. I meet some old friends. Ones in a band that's just been signed. I think everyone in London is in a band. They'll have to draw lots soon for who has to be the audience. And the ones that aren't in bands are DJS. Which are you? Bagsy not my turn to be roadie.  Johnny Cash: JOHNNY CASH!!!  >Friday:  The Bull And Gate. Milky Wimpshake/ A-Lines/ Speed Of Sound/ Cut-Outs/ Spinmaster Plantpot. We show up at 6.30pm for our soundcheck. The soundman was supposed to have been there since 5 soundchecking other bands and sorting out backline etc. Some kinda of muddle sees him turning up at about 7.30pm. Five bands to soundcheck in 30 minutes. We are all a little apprehensive and anticipating big fat Technical Hitches! But actually the sound is fantastic! Okay no one gets to rehearse all those songs they wish they knew better but maybe all those long soundchecks are just unnecessary (gasp!).  Yes 5 minutes per band is the new soundcheck. Why make the bar staff listen to 2 hours of snare drum soundchecks? it's a drum. it's going to go bang. does it really matter on the exact tonal quality of the bang? no. well probably yes actually...Spinmaster Plantpot is a one man rant machine, the cut-outs are like a band that you once saw supporting the 14 iced bears, the shop assistants or the passmore sisters a kind of shamble-fi keyboard peep-po pop hurtle down a pile of stairs piled up with razorcuts, talulah gosh and aaardvarks records (yes bit of that in there too...). Speed of sound are like the soundtrack to a strange european '60s film that's about swinging London without actually having been there...Kind of slightly jarred memories of groovy organ-beat go-go parties with a bitter aftertaste. The A-lines is my band (sorry i always say this but i don't want you to think that i'm going to ignore the fact that they're my band and then say amazing things about them as though i'm not in them or something and then you'll find out and think i'm a faker/ even more of a faker etc etc etc...) Well anyway it's not my place to review my own band. But someone from the Milky Wimpshake Sunderland scene crew tells me that we're 'champion' . And we sell 20 badges!!!! That's shifting units! If you think that there were maybe 120 people there. 20 had badges already then that's 20 percent of people that brought badges. And that's not allowing for people who would have brought badges if they'd realized we had some. So if you apply that to the world (this is of course assuming that the rest of the world would have been at a wimpy milkshake gig on a friday night if they'd only but known about it...) that means i should get about 5 billion badges made. maybe. And hurray! We're really getting someplace! We have picked up some girl-band stalkers! Every all-girl band needs at least one slightly odd male fan. All is right with the world. A man tells me he likes my bass playing whilst staring very hard at a part of me that i definitely don't use when i'm playing bass. he does the same for our guitarist. I meet a man who gave us a bad review once. He denies it was a bad review. I (being a sad fuck...) quote parts of it to him. He tells me I've totally mis-interpreted it and shuffles from foot to foot in oh-dear-ness. One of my bands once got a bad album review in a fanzine. I asked the man who did the bad review if I could have the album back as he obviously didn't like it....but I think it had already gone down the record and tape exchange....anyway enough sad bitterness from the past.... My brother has gone to the Sights at the dirty water club. he says they're good but a bit like hansom gone rock.  Johnny Cash: Take everything you own to the Record and Tape exchange and get some Johnny.  >Saturday:  Shit. Was going to go to Reading today. Okay they took The Darkness away from me and put them on an inaccessible Friday but i was still going to go. But all the bands that I particularly want to see are on early. The Futureheads are on at something like 12noon. And it's now 11am and i've just woken up (Maggie is affectionately pulling my hair with her smelly fish teeth strongly implying that it's kitties brekkers time...) Even if i had a helicopter in my garden to get over the fact that on bank holiday they've fucked up half the trains i still wouldn't make it to reading in time to see the futureheads. or even the agenda or probably not even jet. fuck. so i spend the day sulking like a fulish fule. later that evening i go to the buffalo bar to do the door for careless talk costs lives. Scout Niblett/ Todd/ La Momo/ Swearing At Motorists  / gordon  from cindytalk. Today i am a little bit of a tipsy door-lady. But fear not I stare extra carefully at every note to cancel out the voddikinis effect. Chocolate vodka and lemonade is definitely the coctail of the moment. Except don't have too many of you will definitely be sick (not that i did...- honest- much as john ctcl would have liked to have seen this thank you very much john...) Scout Niblett is wandering around in her Morwenna-Banks-as-naughty-child wig and a circus leotard style outfit. She looks about 20 years younger than she does in the photos i've seen of her. this is odd...normally press photos do their best to blend out oldiness and make you appear smooth and pop-star-beautiful. Scout is much prettier in real life (which is as it should be....). Swearing At Motorists is a Zappa-looking chap plus drummer playing retro style alt-rock which reminds me very much of a band called The Lucys but no one else apart from me ever liked them (not that i ever spoke to anyway) so that probably won't mean much to you. After his set there are still people queueing outside that couldn't get in to see his set. So he takes his guitar outside and plays some songs for the people in the queue. This is cool. I give him 10 out of 10 for coolness on that. He is very enthusiastic/exuberant about what he does. good. i hate moaning minnie bands.la Momo are sort of No Fun on synths and casio handclap beats machines with girl vocals and swooshy syntho noise. Todd are a cacophonous hairy-face noise opera of chunderous noise. Mark and jean-michael bouncer do silly grrrr-punk dances which should definitely be on the Todd video if there ever is one.  The Very Famous I Produced The Strokes Gordon Raphael comes to see Todd. He pays to get in without any 'i'm famous gimme freebies' try-outs. I respect him much more for this than any work he did on The Strokes album. A whole bunch of people totally totally love what Scout Nibletts doing. Me i'm a pleb and i just don't get it. she's drumming along to her own singing in a bit of a free-form style....she's doing the 'give me an a, give me a b' type chants that go on so long i lose track of what word she's spelling. (or is it random letters..???) but like i say people are screaming ecstactically at what she's doing/singing/performing so it's just me don't you worry.  Gordon Sharpe of Cindytalk does a late night swooshy beats behind eerie little couple of songs. Earlier he has had sushi delivered! OOoh get him ! we say....rock-star....but no....the sushi wasn't ordered! someone has had it delivered as a suprise....spooky and little embarassing but yum veggie sushi is scrummy.  Johnny Cash: What can I say?  >Tuesday:  Buffalo Bar- The Electric Shockis/ Whirlwind Heat. I recommend the new electric shocks video. make tom and paul show it to you. kinda found it in a skip version of the bangles going down to liverpool video. on the bus going from kings cross to camden i pass the site of this video. it will be on the (art) rock tour of fame anyday now. came to this show too late to see the bands but I Heard They Were Good!!!!  Johnny Cash....!!!!  >Wednesday:  Public life- yes a toilet indeed. The Square Mile Group are playing. Someone wanders in. 'Two pounds entrance please' the doorlady asks. 'is their a concessionary rate?' asks the customer. She is not joking. We are entertainingly shocked by her stinginess. Square Mile Group aren't helped by the fact that they really are playing a toilet and the sound swings around your head in a bit of an echo chamber battering. But it's kinda Astrid Gilberto style soothing jazzed up indie-bossa stuff that pokes it's head out of the reverberations every now and then. Even the bar-staff gently tap their toes doobie-doobie-doo.  >>>NEXT WEEK  >THURSDAY ***Cobden Club- Club Whoopee. A Mexicali theme and lots of scantily clad ladies in a burlesque affair.
