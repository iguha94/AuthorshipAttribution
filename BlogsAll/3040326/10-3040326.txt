          Too many thugs in KFC  Late afternoon, split from work at 4pm and caught the bus to Ladywell... changed there for a P4 to Brixton, absolutely crowded, no seats.  Arrived at Brixton too early, had to browse in a second hand book shop (made mental note to return, huge stock) then in a novelty shop - was amused by Sigmund Freud action figures ("ideal present").  Went to The Fridge and interviewed Andy Czezowski and Susan Carrington for  3AM , talked for hours and run out of paper, some good lines to hang the piece on.  Left but desperate for toilet, too many thugs in KFC and McDonalds so had to buy a pint.  Mad old lady comes into pub and does a circuit of the tables, she reminds me of a female version of the black janitor in the club in   A Confederacy of Dunces   but is thrown out by over-zealous security guard.  Long bus journey back on P4, pop into Fox and Firkin in Ladywell to see if anyone I know is in, it's dead bar the winos, one starts on me for my "Irish accent", leave and buy a cereal bar on way home.  Finish Houellebecq's   Atomised   on the bus, impressed at moral narrative.  Key in the door, but the phone rings, invited to Oxford Circus to celebrate friend's new job.  Can't be arsed, have one of my own to go to in the morning.
