          Wildly over-sexed and on the net  From the  Telegraph 's literary diary section (no link -- subscription-only):   "The Conville & Walsh literary agency is being inundated with offers this week for  London Calling,  the memoirs of a call-girl who goes by the name of Belle du Jour. The book started life as a weblog, detailing Belle's career trajectory from academia to prostitution. In publishing terms, Belle's main selling point is that she is a 28-year-old academic from a "good family" who confesses herself to be "wildly over-sexed". She has also proved herself to be a lively writer, winning the 2003  Guardian Best-Written Website Award,  and attracting 10,000 readers a day online.   So it is no surprise that her agent is considering bids from the publisher Serpent's Tail, which is offering jointly with Bantam - the same team which published  The Sexual Life of Catherine M  - as well as Weidenfeld & Nicolson.   There are film and TV offers too: from Lloyd Levin, who wrote and produced  Boogie Nights,  and the British producers behind   Footballers' Wives.    An Italian publisher has made a pre-emptive five-figure bid for translation rights.   The book is expected to be a huge success if only because of the Belle Lettriste's anonymity. A frenzied guessing game has begun, with Popbitch, the online gossip column, speculating that the Belle's real-life alter ego might be none other than Toby Young, the  Spectator's  theatre critic."
