          Young author scoops literary accolade before single word written   3AM exclusive  A YOUNG writer was the toast of Fleet Street today when he was included on a respected list of promising authors before he'd even written a single book.  Jake Purbright was a surprise inclusion on the  Charlie  Young British Authors list as it is known that he hasn't even written a book yet.  "This has quite taken me by surprise," said Purbright, 26, from his fashionable home in a multicultural district of North London yesterday.  "There I was just bumming around in Hoxton and the next thing I'm hanging out with Martin Amis and Dave Eggers.  It's great!"  Mr Purbright, a media studies graduate, was thought to have been signed to a six figure publishing deal with Penguin following a lunch at his girlfriend's parents house last year.  "I was a bit depressed, I mean I'm no good at art and I don't think I could handle the workload of being in a band.  So I was just hanging around gallery openings and attending gigs on the guest lists of bands I know but I couldn't actually point to anything I did creative-wise.  Being a writer sounded fun, and easy."  One of Purbright's biggest advocates is the well-known writer Zadie Smith, who met him at a party organised by lastminute.com founder Martha Lane Fox last year.  "I think Jake's writing will have great energy and rawness," said Smith on hearing of the accolade.  Purbright brushed aside criticisms of his inclusion, arguing that he does intend to write a book in the not too distant future.  "I do have a laptop, you know.  It's still in the box but I will get round to writing something very soon."  William Hill shortened the odds of Purbright winning next year's Booker Prize today.  Dave Eggers and Nick Hornby were not available for comment.
