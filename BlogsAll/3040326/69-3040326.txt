          Love Me Don't    Scousers said to be unhappy  at   literary attack on Beatles .  Paul McCartney's bank balance thought to be unhurt.    Iain Sinclair  prominently profiled in  The Guardian  (and   in  a few   other  places   elsewhere ) this weekend:   "I appeared in one of his books sitting on top of a car in a vast Viking beard streaming in the wind as we drove around the M25," Moorcock recalls. "In fact, that incident's taken from my old Hawkwind days when I wasn't quite in my right mind if you know what I mean. It wasn't the M25, it was a B-road in Windsor. Iain produces myths: it's never to be taken straight.   "I reply by putting him in my books. I have this Home Office pathologist called Taffy Sinclair in my metatemporal detective novels. It's all a bit incestuous I suppose, and Iain does get taken to task for that in reviews sometimes."     Douglas Coupland , author and   actor ?    Saving rainforests in 'not old hat' shock!   Monica Ali   'snubbed' ? Oh, the injustice of it all!    Von Bondies  in  The Times .    End of the road  for  The Face  (hat-tip   No Rock & Roll Fun ).    Creative London  agency unveiled.  Starving artists and writers jubilate wildly in the streets.     Smoke  's Jude Rogers featured in Guardian's   'My Media'  section today.
