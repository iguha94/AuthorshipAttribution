          The Bohemians of the Northern Quarter  When I discovered the bohemians of the Northern Quarter I thought my luck was finally in. They sat on austere cushions, dressed in corduroy, clearly stoned in the browning gloom. They laughed, alienating those around them. Here I was: bohemian and yet not at home with the bohemians. They didnt reject me, but advised me to try new, as-yet-unheard-of R n B areas, which didnt really grab me. So I departed, a wandering bohemian, exiled from his own kind, ambling blithely toward the common ground... and somewhere in the middle of the city, she turned to me and said: Tell me; why do architects so frequently dream of towering staircases? She had such an unusual turn of phrase. These were words I had never heard before, certainly never in such a compelling sequence. The sun glistened against the ruddy skin of my face. City life was immediately multiplying our options, I realised. (At a private party, I dropped to my knees uninvited and died a little on the inside. Nobody noticed. So I got back up again and acted like nothing had happened.) One more thing about city life: it drifts in and out of focus. Time moves too fast in the city, ageing things like never before. Was this how city life always flourished? we wondered, somewhere between the borderline of waking and sleeping. Will city life always enjoy such a redolent ebb and flow?
