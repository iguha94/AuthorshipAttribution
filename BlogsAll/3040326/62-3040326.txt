          Now that *is* what I call music  One irritating aspect about being into music so much is the strong likelihood of meeting other people who share your enthusiasm.  It is especially irritating when people attempt to argue that they were already fans of a band they are into now at an unfeasibly young age, or even go so far as to lie about it ("Yeah, of course you saw the Mary Chain on their first tour when you were 10, of course you did..." etc).  To this end, I rarely mention that my first brush with The Smiths was aged eight.  But in late 1983, I was bought a vinyl copy of  Now That's What I Call Music 3  to play on my newly-acquired Amstrad hi-fi -- on the second record there was a song by the name of 'What Difference Does It Make?' by a certain four lads from Manchester.  To be fair, I only liked the song because it was a jaunty number, if it'd been 'How Soon Is Now?' it might have been different and I probably preferred Duran Duran's 'The Reflex' or China Crisis' 'Wishful Thinking'.  My next brush with Johnny Marr wouldn't be until he was in Electronic and even then I taped that off the radio.  But it has   been announced  that   Morrissey  is to   curate the next Meltdown  on the   South Bank in London .  The  LRB  site publishes Andrew O'Hagan's essay on the great man (by way of reviewing   Mark Simpson 's recent literary homage) from their print edition   here .
