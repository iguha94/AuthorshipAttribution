          From having  it  large to having  them  large  I have, thus far, shown about as much interest in   award-winning  blog   Belle de Jour  as I do in the antics of Shane Ritchie or Darren Day.  To even the most untrained eye, it could only ever have been the work of a media insider, a broadsheet journalist perhaps.  As such, the identity of the anonymous call-girl blogger has   vexed the minds  of Fleet Street's   finest , with speculation rife as to who the blogger might be.  So imagine my surprise when it was   revealed today  as none other than   Sarah Champion , chronicler of the e'd up chemical generation and author of many chemical pulp stories herself back then.  Back in the day (1996, to be precise) I had little time for Ms Champion's anthologies of chemical pulp, though one of my housemates at uni purchased them religiously, much to our amusement.  But subsequently, it was explained to me that she'd only intended to have around 5000 of them printed and not to make much of a splash -- as opposed to unwittingly sparking off an entire genre that may be pored over by literary theorists in 30 years hence but means precious little right now.  Sarah is a good friend of Gwen Bowers, who came all the way from San Francisco with her photographer friend Jenn, just to visit the   3am Magazine Xmas Bash  in late December last year.  Gwen and Sarah both hang out at San Francisco's Edinburgh Castle literary cafe, which is run by Alan Black, who interviewed another of the city's British literary ex-pat residents,   Irvine Welsh , for  3AM  recently.  All interesting, anyhow.  I wonder how many   hacks  will be screaming  "We knew it all along!"  now? And if it isn't her, then so what? Get a life and leave her to hers.
