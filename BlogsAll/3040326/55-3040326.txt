          Pop Will Eat Itself  The anti- Mirror  backlash continues apace.  This week's    Private Eye   contains an interesting item in its 'Street of Shame' section:   "IT IS only four months since Piers "Morgan" Moron launched his TV series  The Importance of Being Famous  by attacking the "media-fuelled vacuum of C-grade celebrity nonsense".  As he asked: "What is wrong with us? We are getting so obsessed by these people laughably called stars that we are developing quite scary levels of celebrity psychosis."    So how is the  Daily Mirror  doing its bit to reduce the psychosis level? Why, by launching a weekly  3am Magazine  two weeks ago.  So far, we have learned that Kerry McFadden's hubby Bryan wears pink nail varnish, that former Spice Girl Emma Bunton doesn't like faddy diets and that Victoria Beckham recently bought some grapes in Marks & Spencer.  Last November Piers claimed that nothing better exemplified "the strange, fame-gripped state our nation is now in" that the fact that people from  Pop Idol  are thought newsworthy.  So what did we find in last week's  3am Magazine?  A two-page spread with "25 amazing facts" about, er,  Pop Idol ."   While we couldn't have put it better ourselves, the fact that other media outlets are starting to concentrate so much fire on a  3am Magazine  [sic.] surely exposes the Trinity Mirror's solictors claim that  "I am convinced that you do not have any valid cause for complaint about 3AM or the 3AM pull out."  to nothing short of utter ridicule.  As someone pointed out to me, if a boyband came along called Slipknot then the real Slipknot might have just cause to argue that the confusion arising between the two could be embarassing for the band and its fans.  I feel a strong letter coming on...
