          The Others + The Swear, Paradise Bar, New Cross 25/5/04  A thoroughly enjoyable time was had by all at the Paradise Bar in New Cross last night, the epicentre of the SE14 art rock scene according to the  NME  recently.  Invited, nay instructed, by its formidable promoter Caffy St Luce,  3AM  ventured south of the river to see locals   The Swear  and hotly-tipped Poptones act   The Others .  You might know The Swear from the much-hyped and now scarce   Angular  compilation, who were so good they've been invited to appear on the second one as well.  Frontwoman Tycie (who met her bandmates at Goldsmiths College when I was there a few years back) comes across as a proto-early Madonna (post-punk era, of course) with a bit of that one out of the Cardigans for good measure.  Their songs are fraught and tight, with hardcore fan Andrew providing additional vocals, leading on 'Japanese Pop Song'.  The Others will probably rue the day they played such tiny venues as this -- or maybe secretly hanker after them when they're packing them into larger ones.  Alan McGee has invested much stock in this act and while I once sniggered watching him watch Creation failures One Lady Owner at Reading like a wide-eyed child, on this occasion I think he's right.    The Others  have 'it'.  They shouldn't, coming across as some old indie kids who should know better, but they do.  Recent single 'This Is For The Poor' was kept out of the Top 40 by the Millwall FA Cup single (ironic, given where the Paradise bar is located) but while Millwall limp back into Division One obscurity, The Others will keep on playing regardless of whether anyone wants them to or not.
