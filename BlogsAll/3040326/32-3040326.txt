Programmed by Kendra Gaeta  ***************************************   Sunday, October 19 North Six, doors at 8, show at 9 (sharp)  Brooklyn, New York, USa Live Showcase  *inter-band DJs and visuals by the Mighty Robot Audio/Visual Squad   The Sabers with Mike Sump   Described as a bleed-heavy and brilliantly restrained soundscape, The Sabers melt it down. Loops and field recordings, drumming rhythmic fields, a guitar and one small city of pedals, effects, and mixers distill a surprisingly simple and mesmerizing sonic experience. The video, by Mike Sump, was executed based on saber's music and is a visual reaction to the layered quality the music possesses.   Grandpas Ghost with video by James Ftopoulos  We're going to work from within to help make the head spin... A four-piece band: two guitars, bass, and sound manipulator, with strobing video images by experimental filmmaker Jim Fotopoulos. Locking into rhythms and very certain feels, this performance is self-described as something psychologically to withstand.   Lukasz Lysakowski + Kurt Ralske  Two-thirds of the international performance group 242.Pilots, Lysakowski and Ralske use customized software to explore real time visual improvisation and generative audio visual performance. The New York Times has praised their work as a compelling, intriguing alliance of sound and motion.   Aspect of Physics  Can the tonality and frequency interactions of sound, in a mathematical sense, shed light on the basic root level interactions between humans? Ask Aspects of Physics... Two Aspects perform live in New York with the third, in San Diego. Through a live internet feed, the manipulated audio/visual mix will be fed back and simulcast in San Diego, a block away from the point of origin (just because they can).
