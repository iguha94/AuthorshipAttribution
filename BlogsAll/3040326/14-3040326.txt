          Down the Dustpipe  In a special collaboration between Stephen Malkmus and the South Bank Centre, a two day event entitled   Down The Dustpipe  takes place on Friday April 18th and Saturday April 19th at the Royal Festival Hall. On each night Stephen Malkmus & The Jicks will be headlining a bill initiated by Stephen Malkmus himself and designed to present the weird and the wonderful, the eccentric and the extraordinary, reflecting the diversity of British music past and present.  Over the two nights a series of artists from different eras and idioms will be rubbing shoulders at the Royal Festival Hall. From experimental left-field punks Alternative TV, to undisputed folk legend Bert Jansch on the first night, from blues-prog legends, fronted by Tony McPhee, The Groundhogs to sixties folk chronicler Vashti Bunyan, performing here for the first time in over 30 years on the second night. Both evenings will be concluded by a performance from Stephen Malkmus & The Jicks with Graham Coxon making his first major public performance since leaving Blur on 18th, and Super Furry Animals in their first performance in over a year on 19th.  Stephen Malkmus & The Jicks will be playing a selection of material, old and new, but with a focus on their forthcoming lp, 'Pig Lib' released on Domino Recordings on March 17th. The evening shows will commence at 6.00pm and in addition to those taking place in the main hall, on Saturday April 19th, there will be pre and post concert performances on the RFH Ballroom in the main bar area, by Wizz Jones and Billy Childish & The Buff Medways respectively.
