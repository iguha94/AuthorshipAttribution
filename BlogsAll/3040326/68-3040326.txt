          Forever Horizontal  The   ICA  held a showing of the   Pavement  documentary,  The Slow Century  last night, so attendance was in order.  To be honest, my initial attraction was to the billing of    Heavy Metal Parking Lot   as the warm-up feature, as it's not available on DVD yet and I've only ever  heard  about it, not  seen  it.  So you can imagine my displeasure when in fact the presented feature was actually  Harry Potter Parking Lot , an ironic take on the franchise based around a JK Rowling appearance at a Politics and Prose store in the US.  A few years back,  3AM 's   Bertie Marshall  discussed on this very blog the demise of the ICA cinema (when they attempted to show a   Baader Meinhof  documentary and failed, offering no refunds) and I felt similarly cheated by their jipping me.  Were it not for the fact that the actual feature was an amazingly well-assembled piece of film on one of the 90s most key and influential (yet often overlooked) bands, I would have stormed out of there, demanding the head of the cretinous soul who lied on the literature about what films were on.  It's on again on 30/4 and 6/5 so if you're able to, I'd well advise watching it.  Just don't believe them about  Heavy Metal Parking Lot .  Meanwhile... a   shoegazing weblog  has been launched.  Will wonders ever cease?
