          I've a bone to pick with you    Elsewhere on  3AM  , there are those who take issue with the  Evening Standard 's pop critic.  I want to take issue with 'literary critic' David Sexton's column (for the second time in a month).  In today's offering, Sexton discusses (no weblink, of course) the forthcoming   Get London Reading  initiative of the Mayor, Ken Livingstone.  This is not just another 'Big Read' type affair, its purpose being to promote literature about London in all its forms.  Of course, as is the way these days, there is a   definitive shortlist  of 12 essential London books (all by living authors and in paperback) to devour and devour it Sexton does.  Sexton's contention is that there  "is no, single, unarguably great novel about contemporary London."  at the moment for readers to  "give a friend from New Zealand or France to read about London"  as apart  "from maybe Ruth Rendell, there aren't even any great crime contenders (Yorkshire and Edinburgh fare better)."  I'm sure Jake Arnott will be pleased with that.  Furthermore  "We have no Dickens today."  I'm sure well all share Sexton's indignation and anxiety at this parlous state of affairs.  History will be the judge however and I'm equally as sure that right now, somewhere in London someone is scribbling away at a book that will fill this over-agonised void.  A few weeks ago, Mr Sexton penned a piece for his London-based paper on how literary websites were becoming more and more important.  Great stuff, I thought, shame the article wasn't online.  And from what country did the sites he mentioned hail from? The US, of course.  I wrote Mr Sexton a polite letter mentioning this and did he bother to reply? Of course he didn't.
