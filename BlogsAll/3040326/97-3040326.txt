          A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Blogger  I shall depart, to do whatever it is I do at weekends, leaving you with Stella Vine's (who's definitely  not  a   Stuckist  anymore, by the way)   blog  for company.  Over at  Idealog , there's an   interview with  3AM 's Richard Marshall  about, erm,   3AM Magazine .  I think we get more than 7000 hits a day though (circa 30 000 unique users, to be precise).  The other day I found the bizarrest and most hyperbolic description of us ever (to have not been written by myself) over at the otherwise quite good   Kultureflash :   "One may have lost oneself in London and still not heard of The Horse Hospital, 3am Magazine, or Richard Strange. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't take a chance on the cosmic conjunction of all three this Saturday. Indeed the line-up is almost supernatural in it's assortment of high-cool low-recognition avant-gardeness. It should be a blazing array of pop-punk poetry and literary swagger. Basically the unrepentantly midcult e-journal, 3am magazine is having a party. Standing on their chairs and letting it all hang loose for the party people will be such luminaries as arch YBA-apologist Matthew Collings, Billy Childish -- king of his own little world, Vic Godard still doing Punk like it never went out, came back and went out of style again, Bertie Marshall psycho-lit boy, the aforementioned Richard Strange, the sexy Mitzi Szereto and, jeez, about ten other spokesman for counter-culture. Jessica Callan tragically won't be there (3am launched two years before the Mirror girls were ever a twinkle in Piers Morgan's eye) but don't let that hold you back. It'll be different, that much is certain. And hey, think how less lost you'll be."    I haven't felt so proud since I discovered we were on the Links page of the   Cheech and Chong  website.
