CHARLES PLYMELL Godfather of Zap Comics, creator of the Wichita Vortex, host of Cherry Valley Editions, and so much more. One of the great poets of the centuries & a mad polemicist to boot.  BYRON COLEY Massachusetts-based peddler of smut poems.  At Tonic, there will be additional readings by:  GARY PANTER Father of Jimbo, inventor of the best parts of the L.A. punk ethos (like the Screamers logo), and a dedicated fan of Chaucer. He will shake it all loose!  JOHN MORTON From the Electric Ells to Johnny & the Dicks to Electricfuckingeeels.com, John Morton has ridden the hot wires of aggressive-art in as many dark nooks as anyone. Tonight, he will rip some new assholes. Tasty!  In Montreal, there will be an additional reading by Thurston Moore. The Montreal show will also be broadcast by KCUT, so if you cant make it, make it.
