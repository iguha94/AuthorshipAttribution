          Imagine The Excitement   Kids! At the end of this broadcast, you're going to want to rush to your parents and tell them all the wonders you have heard! They will be so proud, so spiritually uplifted to see how grown up you are becoming that they will no doubt increase your allowance! As of today, a small but important piece of US legislation was passed which allows all children under the age of 18 to sign a pledge sheet guaranteeing their future enrollment in your choice of the army, navy, air force, or marine corps. Imagine being the first at your school to proudly display a Semper Fi tattoo! The other children will be so green with envy that they will double over and vomit patriotism at your feet! For a simple commitment of four years to help us stock our new perpetual war you too can be th envy of all that is seen, known, and loved in the world! This offer isn't valid if you are queer or sissy, but they would have stopped reading the ad ages ago. Go now, kids! Go tell your parents that you want to be one of the few who stood tall in the face of terrorist threats to come, whether they be from such aggressive nation-states as Iraq! Canada! Ireland! Puerto Rico! Why, you'll have all the fun of playing guns but with live rounds! Think of all you'll see and all you'll get to kill! George W. Bush will be so proud of you.
