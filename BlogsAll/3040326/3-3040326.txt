          National ban your stereotypes day!   So, a few weeks ago Andy posted a    Buzzwords  about A Russian Mail Order Bride website and I decided to go find out if all the hype about Russian women is true. Are they harsh but subservient, cold and greedy, detached and sexual? Well I found myself at a restaurant on Friday night drinking merlot with a particularly short, curvaceous, wild haired, and feisty Russian Jew, who I will call Natasha for the sake of flip flopping stereotypes out of a meaningless cycle and into non-perpetuation. She was funny and cynical and sexy as sin. She rolled her Rs everytime she said "Probably" which she said a lot.  She told me I was like strawberries with extra cream. She invited me to stay the night and we laughed until dawn listening to Russian pop music and talking about the politics of Israel and the cab drivers who will fuck anything in a skirt and I found myself feeling irritated by our collective conscious' pseudo-stereotype machine. The only thing machine-made "Russian" about this girl was the amazing syllabic accent and the fact that her mother had to unleash a queue of bribes to get her to the U.S.A. where she remains happy, feeling luckier than most U.S.A. residents do to be here, and works her days in a natural foods restaurant as she studies to be an international translator. I am declaring today NATIONAL BAN YOUR STEREOTYPES DAY in honor of Natasha, for like she said as the sun began to rise over a beautiful Californian Day: "Let me make this perfectly clear, it is now precisely 3 A.M."
