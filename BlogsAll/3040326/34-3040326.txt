          An online Fitzrovia?   3AM  continues to attract praise from the quality press in Britain with this mention in   last Saturday's Daily Telegraph :   "In Bloomsbury, 3ammagazine.com hosted a reading by young novelists. The line-up was suitably roguish for a website that aims to be an online Fitzrovia. It included the novelist Matt "New Puritan" Thorne and Daren King, whose novel Jim Giraffe will be published by Cape in February.   Thorne read from his newly completed novel, Cherry, which won't be published until 2005 since Faber is launching him as a children's author later this year and Cherry contains "scenes of an adult nature". King's story of a lewd ghost giraffe has already been promised cult status in two broadsheets, as well as in Penthouse magazine - under the circumstances, King said, "that's the one I'm most pleased about".   Also reading were Toby Litt, one of Granta's top 20 Young British Novelists, and the art critic Matthew Collings. Perhaps it was the company, but Collings confessed to feeling disaffected with artists' illiterate conversation and drunken habits. Certainly his wife is encouraging him to lead a more temperate life. For Christmas she gave him three months' membership of Holmes Place."   So that's  The Times ,  Guardian  and now the  Telegraph .  Anyone at  The Independent  care to comment? Your new tabloid's really good, by the way...
