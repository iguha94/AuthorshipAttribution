          Revenge  Every year on a rainy day in December I am obligated to go to a fashion show for the Catholic School I was forced to go through as a child. Along with my wine-drinking wise-cracking mother, my bitchy St. John knit wearing Aunt, and my sophisticated-ly insane Jewish grandmother from New York, I get to submit myself to four hours of clothes I would never wear pranced around on models i would never fuck all in the name of carrying on a family tradition. This year I have decided to have a little fun. I am going to arrive in a shirt made out of my deconstructed catholic school uniform in the name of lustful sacrilege and I am going to wear three crosses in my ears to remind the nuns of the little ear piercing shop I sed to set up in their bathrooms. My favorite parts of days like these, are watching the male teachers cringe when they see me and remember all the debates I created to partake in with them and then watching the realization sweep over their faces that as as a hedonistic non-conformist, I am not burning in hell but am actually quite successful. Hee Hee.   As the resident 3 AM mush, I want to throw out some love to all you beautiful co-editor men and sexy Utahna. Wasco you are brilliant. Bertie you're magnificently nuts. Howie Wowie. Jim thank god we have you to yank our helium filled chains every so often. G you're cute. Andrew you are magical. Everyone else have a great holiday season. I only get this mushy a few times a year.
