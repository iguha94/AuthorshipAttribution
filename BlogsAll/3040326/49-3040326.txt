          Indie Obscura Day  In a bid to place as much clear blue water between us and our doppelganger friends at the   phoney 3am , a new feature at  3AM  will be  Indie Obscura Day , every Monday.  This will be a comprehensive run-down in the form of a tribute to the much-neglected but not forgotten indie stars of yesterday, for whom the royalty cheques always fail to materialise.  First up in this series is Cud, indie superstars of yore, hailing from Leeds in the early 90s.  The   allmusic.com  synopsis of their career reads:   "Weird humor and eclectic musical parody are the hallmarks of Leeds, England's Cud, an indie-rock group consisting of vocalist Carl "Y.F.B." Puttnam, guitarist/keyboardist Mike Dunphy, bassist William Potter, and Steve "The Infamous Drummer From Cud" Goodwin. The foursome's impetus for founding a band was provided by a discarded drum set happened upon in a junkyard in 1987; just two years later, Cud had built a small northern England fan base and released their debut album, When in Rome, Kill Me. Their early indie singles and compilation/tribute album tracks were collected on 1990's Elvis Belt, and a new LP, Leggy Mambo, appeared later in the year. The singles "Robinson Crusoe" and "Magic" scraped the lower reaches of the British charts, sparking major-label interest; Cud allegedly chose A&M simply because the label had a trumpet in its logo. After a 1991 EP, Cud issued its acclaimed full-length A&M debut, 1992's Asquarius. 1994's Showbiz was released to similarly positive reaction, but the band's eclecticism perhaps made them too difficult to pigeonhole for commercial tastes, and the hoped-for sales success did not materialize."    Little-known factoid:  Cud were once mentioned (alongside Ride) in a Reeves and Mortimer sketch about an anal-retentive newsagent who managed indie bands.   Where now?:  This   website  pretty much details what they had for breakfast yesterday...
