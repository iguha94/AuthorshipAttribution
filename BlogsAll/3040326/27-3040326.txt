When I started writing I never thought it would get this far, there were so many obstacles in the way, but once I got started - I just couldn't stop. All the musicians who helped me with this record did it as a favour. The album was recorded in Linus one bedroom flat in Hollywood and if you listen carefully you may be able to hear the noisy neighbour downstairs blaring out 80s hard rock. I would describe it as a cheer you up record, songs of joy & travel with influences from all of my favourite artists, rolled into my own style. This album is me, so check it out & turn it up!
