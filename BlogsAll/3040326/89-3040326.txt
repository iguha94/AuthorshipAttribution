          Recent Britflick in 'not bad' shock!  I went to see the   Football Factory  at the weekend.  Don't get me wrong, I don't 'do' football but I think John King (who wrote the book of the film back in the 90s) is as good a writer as   Irvine Welsh  when it comes to documenting inner city life in Britain.  It's worth saying from the outset that the film could have been a lot worse -- we're hardly known for making convincing criminality films of late.  Thankfully, it being made in 2004 rather than 1994, it seems you can do more with low budgets these days and while the soundtrack is ever-present, it tends to veer towards the Libertines and   Primal Scream  end of the spectrum (with two recent Scream tracks for comfort on there).  Fading out with 'Going Underground' by The Jam was somewhat predictable and while there's one or two well-worn cliches in there, on the whole it's a surprisingly well-made film (yes, I did go to the cinema expecting to be disappointed, but what can you do?).  One thing though -- I used to live above a pub frequented by Millwall thugs and I can honestly say that the ones depicted in the film were effeminate PhD candidates compared to the ones I met.  Apparently Mark Perryman, author of    The Ingerland Factor   and founder of   philosophyfootball.com , is going to review the film for  3AM .
