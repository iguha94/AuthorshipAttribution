          Trouble at mill  Once again,   MediaBitch nails it  with their biting expose of  Mirror  staff's true feelings about the tacky gossip rag forced on them by the men in suits:   "It seems theres a little tension in the air at Canary Wharf following the launch of the  Mirror s  3am Magazine.   Unlike the  Mirror  itself, the first edition of the magazine bulged with naked flesh. It carried a series of explicit screengrabs of the raunchiest moments from Sex in the City that would never have made it into the newspaper. The phones been ringing from angry parents ever since.  One staffer revealed: We never see them  theyre on a different floor. They dont seem to understand what the Mirrors about, but then neither do some of the people in the senior management."   Over at  The Independent , former  Mirror  Editor Bill Hagerty   reveals  similar tensions:   "Following my observations in this space on the  Daily Mirror's 3am Magazine,  I received a most lucid letter from a member of its production staff. Far from, as I wrote, the magazine team believing that the newspaper has totally lost its way, he insisted: "I am inordinately proud to be on this paper." He and other team members saw their role as helping to boost the  Mirror  circulation to back over two million and "trying to revive the spirits of this once-great institution".  In the face of such admirable passion, I concede that I must have been ill-informed on this point."    Oh well, if they're that pissed off, they can always come and work for the   real 3AM Magazine .  I can guarantee them a pint a week by way of a salary.  A pint of milk, that is.
