          Exclusive: 3am interview with Will Self    3am  was given the opportunity to chat with leading author Will Self recently following the London Book Fair.  Here's what he had to say...  3am: What's your favourite colour? Will: I tend not to think of  a colour  but more of  colours , as such.  Red is immediately recalled as the crimson fluid that flows directly through the pulsating aorta of Ballard's 1970s works, for instance, whereas black could be seen as a direct link to the more macabre elements of 1980s New York gay society.  Of course, New Labour has considerably diluted the ability of the colour red to arouse even the slightest modicum of socialist fervour in the modern age.  3am: What's the last record you bought?

Are you suggesting a conscious surgical procedure or transmogrification by another means?  3am: You what? Err...
