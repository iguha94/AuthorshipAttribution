          Dude,  you're  confused?    Mark Sarvas  over at   The Elegant Variation  blog wonders what exactly is being judged in the  3AM  Good Sex Prize --   the judges or actual fiction ? For his benefit, I'll reiterate the shortlist, as I confess, it was a wee while between announcing the shortlist and the judges and anyone not paying attention could get confused:  Frederic Beigbeder,  6.99 , Picador, July 2003 Stewart Home,  Down and Out in Shoreditch and Hoxton , The Do-Not-Press, February 2004  Michel Houellebecq,  Lanzarote , Heinemann, July 2003 Mounsi,  The Demented Dance , Black Amber, July 2003 Ben Myers,  The Book of Fuck , Wrecking Ball Press, February 2004  Adam Thirlwell,  Politics , Jonathan Cape, August 2003  Helen Walsh, Brass,  Canongate , March 2004  Tony White,  Foxy-T , Faber and Faber, July 2003  OK, it's a bit of an EU-centric affair as there's no US novels to speak of in the list, primarily because no one nominated any.  There's always the 2005 prize for that I guess, if any US authors write any that is (tip: write one now and it might win).  However, my post of the other day on the list of judges, although now amended, was not strictly true as I omitted both   Toby Litt  and   Andrei Codrescu , primarily because I didn't know   Andrew Gallix  had approached them to be judges and the first I knew of it was when they voted (having done so before most of the announced judges).  As such, two authors are now level-pegging in the lead, though obviously I can't say who they are.  So, to recap on that front, here are the judges in full:  - Steve Almond - Andrei Codrescu - Jessa Crispin of  Bookslut  - Richard Hell - Tom Hodgkinson of  The Idler  - Toby Litt - DBC Pierre - Neal Pollack - Jude Rodgers of  Smoke  - Scarlett Thomas - Matt Thorne - Peter Wild of  Bookmunch   Whether that list is for my or your benefit remains to be seen.
