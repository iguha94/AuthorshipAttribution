          The new rock and roll, broadsheet-style  When it falls out of the paper alongside all other manner of crap and flyers,  The Observer 's   Music Monthly  section is pored over obsessively.  When it was announced that Music (alongside Food and, yawn, Sport) would be the third component of the paper's added-extras drive to actually maintain people's interest, I was like  "Ex-Select journalists apply here or what?" , though so far I've not seen Sian Pattenden's* byline on any articles.  In yesterday's section, there was a piece on the new   'Grime' scene  of East London.  Forgive me for thinking that this is the worst case of over-egged simplistic journalism in search of a story that doesn't exist since Stephen Glass stopped writing for the  New Republic .  I did find author   Simon Armitage's CD collection make-over  amusing though.    This   Girls With Guitars  album looks promising too.  (* She wrote for  Select  and such-like in the 1990s, a lot.

He hasn't changed at all ( "Creation weren't a bad label, they just probably weren't the label for us" ).)  Elsewhere, Damien Hirst is to   open a bar  in the quaint Devon town of Ilfracombe.    Charles Thomson  will be barred straight off, I expect.  More   Morrissey  comeback   antics  in the usual places.  The dour   Royal Academy  gets a pasting.    Irvine Welsh  on Jessa Bookslut's favourite,   James Kelman 's  You Have To Be Careful In The Land Of The Free .    More pictures  of The Pixies looking not-so-cool anymore.
