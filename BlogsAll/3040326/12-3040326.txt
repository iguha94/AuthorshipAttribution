            DISASTODROME  takes place this weekend at   UCLA   David Thomas, the founder of Pere Ubu is organising a three-day festival of "voice and vision where the reputation of 18 avant-garage heroes will be collectively tested" at UCLA (February 21-23). Disastodrome! will include live performances by Pere Ubu, David Thomas and the Two Pale Boys, Frank Black, and The Kidney Brothers, as well as the first appearance in 27 years of the legendary Rocket From The Tombs and the American premiere of David Thomas' rogue opera, Mirror Man:   "Disastodrome! continues a series of events conceived as an antidote to datapanik. In 1976 David Thomas and John Thompson note that in a state of data overload all 'new' information will only serve as a sedative-like drug, a junkie culture becomes inevitable, dataflow can be the only social imperative, and that discrimination, or any other hinderance to dataflow, must become anathema. Dataflow Junkies pursue a highly ritualized course. A break in routine can lead to disaster... to datapanik! The symptoms of datapanik are easily recognized: doubt and fear of the moment. Is what I'm experiencing meaningful... enough? What will my friends say? Is everything okay? Disastodrome creates a space in which the ordinary citizen can be freed from that burden of anticipation haunting the data-junkie. Only Disastodrome can guarantee that nothing will go wrong. 'It's a mess!' The cry goes up. 'It's a disaster!' Oh no, my brothers, Disasto reassures us that everything is going absolutely according to plan. Relax. Let it wash over you."
