          Terror Vaccine   I watched a show last night about the whole small pox vaccinations thing, and it really got me thinking. I just wanted to take a moment to formally thank the leaders of our world. You see, the show kept telling us how we had eradicated small pox, but some of it still existed in freezers and had ultimately found its way (read: got sold on the hush hush) into the hands of terrorists for their weapons of mass gonnafuckyouupness. Why was it that we felt the need to keep the most deadly virus known to man in freezers? Wouldn't it have made sense given that we had eradicated a plague to simply destroy what we had? No more small pox means no more small pox. That's easy math. So why didn't we? Could it be because we also recognized the awesome power of using it on our enemies? That we knew that if the right circumstances presented themselves, our best defence might be a biological response in a quarantinable environment? They say that the Israeli army are all vaccinating against small pox. Can you imagine if their intent was to barricade cities in the disputed territories and infect the people therein with small pox, and then blame the victims for having their biological warfare bombs just sort of go off by accident? It's way too early for this sort of thing, but I can't help thinking about it. My wife and I were talking about it last night, and she asked if we weren't just paranoid. My response? We might be, and it pisses me off that I live in a world where I have to be. But I do, and I can't honestly trust the people we elect to protect our interests to not be lying to us and selling those interests short as they play the Grander Scale game.
