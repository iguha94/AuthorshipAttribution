          Congratulations!   Congratulations on your purchase of an authentic French guillotine! We know that whether it's simply held as a conversation piece or as an active part of your new lifestyle, you'll find that nothing seems quite the same after this purchase. There are a few notes one should keep in mind as the owner of such a magnificent piece of history. First of all, it is of dreadful import to keep the mechanism working and the blade razor sharp. Authenticity is authenticity, after all, and what would they have said if the blade had fallen on some toxically inbred monarchist and simply left a really mean bump? The second thing to consider along with the physical maintenance of the guillotine is your own familiarity with the object. It wouldn't do to be fumbling about at a party trying to get the stupid blade to drop down and cut a pineapple for punch. We recommend that you keep your skills as sharp as the blade and as well oiled as the machine. Easy ways to do this include practicing on fruit, newspapers, lumber, or homeless persons. The last point we would like to make before leaving you to get acquainted with your authentic French guillotine is the need for safety. Keep your children a safe distance from the guillotine (so long as it isn't a piece being bought for disciplinarian reasons), and always make sure that nobody puts an arm through that they do not want to lose in the first place. Enjoy your authentic French guillotine!
