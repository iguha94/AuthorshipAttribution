          You're so vain, you probably think this blog is about you    The Bookslut  on Toby Young:   "Just in case you didn't hate Toby Young enough the first time he released a book, the vile and unsympathetic  How to Lose Friends & Alienate People  (you can read the Bookslut review here, which begins with, "You can probably tell a lot about a person by knowing at which point during  How to Lose Friends and Alienate People  he or she started to hate Toby Young."), he's writing another book. While he's writing that book, he's writing a diary for Slate:   I've only been in Los Angeles for 10 days, but this theory makes a lot of sense to me. In the same way that other cities have been ravaged by certain drugs, L.A. is in the grip of a fame epidemic. Like cocaine, it used to be the drug of choice for a privileged few, but now it's gone mainstream, often in a very adulterated form. The kind of notoriety that comes from appearing on a reality show, for instance, is the equivalent of crack. In effect, a few unscrupulous pushers have worked out how to cook fame in a microwave, and as a result an entire generation of Americans has been decimated.   Yeah, we get it. It's a drug metaphor. Now stop it."   I also enjoyed some   email correspondence the Bookslut received recently  from a rather unappreciative reader of her blog:   Your website bookslut, is the most ridiculous, dehumanizing book site I have ever seen. If you want to use the title bookslut, have a naked man reading, not a women. It is insulting to women and just plain stupid.  You should be ashamed of yourself. No self-respecting person would be a part of this.  You could have named your group anything, but chose that. You are silly and nasty.
