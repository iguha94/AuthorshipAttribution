Today is a brighter day in many ways! For one, itâ€™s almost Friday, which means that Cacky will be here tomorrow! Chris is off work tomorrow & Saturday.

The front will stay the same, but the backside will be one of two designs: a handshake or the Lois & Clark longboat. Itâ€™s about time the nickel got proper recognition.  On the web: There will be a total eclipse of the moon on Saturday. At the peak, the moon will hang in the night sky like a dark, reddish-orange coal. The eclipse reaches totality at 8:06 p.m. Saturday night, EST. That stage -- when the moon, Earth and sun are lined up precisely and the moon passes through the darkest part of Earth's shadow -- lasts just 24 minutes.

Weird but True (courtesy New York Post): Canadian biologists puzzled by a mysterious, underwater sound think it could be herrings farting.  â€œIt sounds like a high-pitched raspberry,â€ said Ben Wilson of the University of British Columbia. Makes me wonder what goldfish sound like . . .
