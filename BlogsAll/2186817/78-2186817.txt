We're having the strangest weather this week. It was all nice and sunny last week - temperatures into the 60's. This week, IT'S SNOWING. And not just some teeny-tiny little snow flurries here and there. Big fat snowflakes! And now it's stopped. Good, since I forgot my umbrella today.  On the work front, I've finally gotten most of the tax forms faxed off to the 50-something people who requested them. Unfortunately, my boss dumped a whole load of stuff on the production department (which are requests for presentation materials - like 20 copies of each in color). Most of the people in that department are cussing him about now. One girl is so busy (& upset) she won't even look at me since I'm his messenger. And I think he's just informed me in a roundabout way that I may be staying late to help him get something done since he'll be out the rest of the week. On top of that, I still have to go over to my friend's apt in Sunnyside (Queens) to feed her cat. She had to fly home to take care of her mom who broke her hip while her dad goes to the funeral of his wife's brother. Follow me? Tends to get a little confusing at times. I guess this means that Chris will have to start the dinner we were supposed to make last night. Lucky Chris. Oh! And on top of that big pile of crap, I'm exhausted again today. I can feel that pain between my shoulders again.  Pretty cool   blog by a fellow NY'er .
