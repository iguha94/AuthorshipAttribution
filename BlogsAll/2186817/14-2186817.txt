By now, youâ€™ve surely seen or heard the stories that Michael Jacksonâ€™s estate, Neverland Ranch, was searched by investigators on claims than another 12 or 13-year-old boy was molested while on the property. Police came armed with an arrest warrant with Jacksonâ€™s name along with 60 to 70 investigators. From dangling babies over the side of balconies to admittedly sleeping in the same bed as young children that he brings into his home, itâ€™s about time someone or some agency investigated this man. Iâ€™ll agree that he was all the rage in the 80â€™s, but there is a limit! Oh, and I was watching the news this morning as Iâ€™m getting ready and I see that a few Wall Street brokers were arrested for taking commissions on deals that never went through. Bad brokers. Canâ€™t really feel sorry for them since what they did was wrong and I see them as being a money-hungry type of person anyway. I guess it really doesnâ€™t surprise me that theyâ€™ve finally been arrested.  On the war front, Chris & I have a friend who is in the Marines, Jeremy Lewis. Heâ€™s like 20 to 40 days away from getting out, but his group has been pulled to go to Iraq. I donâ€™t know how long heâ€™ll be there and Iâ€™m not sure he really knows either. Once he finishes over there, heâ€™ll come back home and then heâ€™ll have an additional 90 days left to complete. Then heâ€™ll finally be released. Iâ€™ll be happy when that happens.   Interesting fact for you on this rainy Wednesday: The United States produces more carbon dioxide than any other country by far. Each American, on average, generates about 45,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year. That is about twice as much as the average person living in Japan or Europe.  I read a story this morning on how women are getting their feet surgically altered in order to wear fashionable shoes. The surgeries are actually medically necessary or would be at some point. They are for removing corns, calluses, bunions, correcting hammertoes, etc., which I canâ€™t knock. I think it was the quote at the end of the story by flight attendant Gloria Diaz: â€œI don't care what my feet feel like," she said. "I will wear a beautiful shoe no matter how much it hurts if I have to, but now it doesn't have to hurt!" (courtesy MSNBC.com)  OK, and finally for one of the most insane things Iâ€™ve heard/read lately: Hip-hop magazine, The Source, has accused Eminem, the rapper, of racism. He allegedly said, â€œBlack girls are dumb, and white girls are good chicksâ€ on an album that dates back to 1993. On the tape, he was rapping about his breakup with his black girlfriend. He said that he made it out of frustration right after their breakup. Iâ€™m not saying that he didnâ€™t say this, but has ANYONE listened to his songs? Is this suddenly the only outlandish thing heâ€™s done? The guy has been sued by his own mother â€“ enough said. Heâ€™s always been followed by controversy. Itâ€™s what he does best.  Wait, I just read something else that, well, as Jerry Brown puts it, â€œmakes your bootie winkâ€: A Texas baby is recovering Tuesday, one day after doctors at Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park created an anal opening for him. Chief of Pediatric Surgery Dr. Alberto Pena performed the rare anorectal surgery on the 10-month-old baby boy Monday. The operation was teleconferenced live to Hadassah Hospital in Israel, where about 80 surgeons from Israel, Greece, Turkey and Italy watched. Pena developed the procedure and has done about 1,700 anorectal surgeries since 1986. He says the problem is a birth defect in which the anus and rectum do not develop properly. This type of malformation affects one in 5,000 newborns annually. (courtesy WNBC.com)  And finally, on this day in 1863: President Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address.
