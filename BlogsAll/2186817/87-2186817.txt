Chris & I went to see Kill Bill: Vol 2 last night and it was great!  Not as bloody as the first one, but it tied up all ends in a nice little package.  I definitely recommend it, but please watch Vol. 1 before seeing Vol. 2.  That's just the way these things work, people.  Weekend Links:    Classic SNL skit on how to deal with your child being gay .  Hilarious!  Now here are a series of cartoons by the creators of South Park - need I say they are dirty, contain nudity & obviously not appropriate to watch during "working hours" unless of course you think you're a badass and can get away with it.  Just remember: the IT department is watching!!    Cartoon #1     Cartoon #2   And now for something you can share with your whole family:   Escher's "Relativity" in Legos .  Pretty cool, but I wonder how long it took them to do this.  I'm sure I'm going to hell for putting this next link on here, but I simply couldn't resist.  It's the   Jesus Christ action figure playset .  Cross not included.    THE WARNING SIGNS OF MASTURBATION .  Sponsored by your local White House.  What frightens me on this one is that this website looks so official, yet very obvious it's completely satirical.  Please correct me if I'm wrong on this one.  OK, that's enough for today.  Hopefully more links will follow tomorrow.  Today's plan is to wander aimlessly around the SoHo/East Village part of Manhattan today since it is such a beautiful day!  Get out & enjoy the nice weather!
