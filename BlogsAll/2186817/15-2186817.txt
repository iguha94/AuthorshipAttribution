So far, today is a much more relaxed day than yesterday. However, I now have my â€œirkâ€ of the day: I booked roundtrip tickets for someone that I work for. I was given the dates by someone else. Flights booked, itinerary printed, placed in folder & given to traveler. Today, I find out that they never went on that trip nor was it cancelled. Weâ€™ve lost the money on that trip and we really canâ€™t do anything about it. I feel like yelling at the person who gave me the dates because she looks at me all innocently, but Iâ€™m not going to yell or really say anything because it wouldnâ€™t do any good. In truth, she could have given me the correct dates and I just screwed everything up myself. Who really knows at this point? Luckily, it wasnâ€™t one of our most expensive trips. Instead, Iâ€™ll just take a few deep breaths and try to think about other things and how I can make this whole situation better. But I still want to hit something.  In breaking news: the Massachusetts' highest court today ruled that the state couldnâ€™t deny gays and lesbians the right to marry. The court stopped short of allowing marriage licenses to be issued to the couples that challenged the existing law -- and gave the state Legislature 180 days to find a solution. (courtesy CNN.com) Interesting development considering if one state allows same sex marriages, then all states must allow them. Iâ€™ll be curious to see how this one ends.  Weâ€™ve all heard of jelly bracelets. We wore them in the 80â€™s (a-la Madonna style) and they are of course making a comeback. However, in some of the local schools here in NYC, the jelly bracelets are associated with a game called â€œsnapâ€ in which different colored bracelets represent different sexual acts. In some variations of the game, a yellow bracelet symbolizes hugging; purple means kissing; blue means oral sex; and red means a lap dance and if someone breaks a bracelet, he or she is entitled to a sexual favor. I, for one, cannot believe this! Its nuts! These kids are like 12 and 13 years old. Theyâ€™re KIDS! Theyâ€™ve likened to a modern day form of spin-the-bottle. You know, I hate to admit it, but of the 2 or 3 times I played spin-the-bottle, I always hoped it would never land on me! I hated that game!
