Mom is going in for a hysterectomy today. About time, too! The only down side is that she wonâ€™t be able to do any lifting for about 6 weeks. Iâ€™m happy that sheâ€™s finally getting this done, but I wish I could be there anyway. Iâ€™m not sure if anyone has ever heard of exploding manhole covers. I had never heard of it until earlier this year and living in NYC, many (paranoid) people this it is terrorism related. Itâ€™s actually due to a buildup of steam or gas. Iâ€™ve never actually seen it happen, but I remember when they started exploding on 5th Avenue once. Today, theyâ€™re exploding in Queens, but not where I live. OK, so Iâ€™ve moved on to looking for Thanksgiving dinner recipes. Iâ€™ve printed out 2 different menus: A Simple Feast for a Small Gathering & Light and Healthy Thanksgiving Dinner. I think Iâ€™ll read over both and go with the one that looks least complicated.  Not sure if I ever revisited this piece, but a few days ago, I wrote that there is a new British Royal scandal that has been shrouded in mystery because no one is allowed to divulge any details. Well, the rumor around the mill is that Prince Charles might be bi-sexual or he had a bi-sexual affair with one of his former servants. Of course, this could all be BS and I think it is BS. Iâ€™ve been trying to read up on it and it seems that there are so many rumors floating around; seems like the press has been feeding the flames by printing â€œwhat ifsâ€ boosting their sales. I just think its funny that there is another British Royal scandal, but no one knows what it is and yet there is all of this denial and lawsuits to block the press from printing it, etc. Crazy!! In other news, at least six Brazilian prisoners suffocated in a sewer after an attempted escape from the Sao Paulo State Penitentiary on Sunday afternoon, the state Security Secretariat said. In all, it is reported that 87 inmates tried to escape. They believe that there are another 7 prisoners who are dead, lost in the myriad of tunnels and pipes.  As part of my job here at Sentinel Real Estate Corp., I work on a fund called SB Partners. Many times people need to re-register an account or they sell their interest in the fund. When that happens and the original holder of the account is deceased, they must supply us with a copy of the death certificate. Interestingly enough, I always seem to find myself looking at the death certificate to see what they died of and how old they were. I got one the other day and the cause of death was â€œorganic brain syndrome.â€ What? OK, so Iâ€™d never heard of this disorder so I turn to the Internet to answer all of my newfound questions. Turns out that this is just a generic term for the things that happen to your body as you get older or by definition â€œOrganic brain syndrome is a general term which refers to physical disorders that cause a decrease in mental function, usually not including psychiatric disorders.â€  Examples are degenerative disorders (Huntingtonâ€™s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimerâ€™s, etc.), Cardiovascular disorders (stroke, etc.). OK, so the list actually goes on and on, but you get point. Itâ€™s basically anything that happens to you when you get old that decreases your mental capabilities. So, by request, on my death certificate, please have them put under cause of death â€œstopped breathing and she wonâ€™t wake up.â€ That should sum up the problem.  I found a very interesting website for all of you who have ever wondered: Where does my poop go? So check out the link below. Itâ€™s kind of a long read, but not too bad and youâ€™ll probably have a few questions answered by the end of the article. Enjoy! http://www.portlandmercury.com/2002-12-24/feature.html  Oh, and thanks Becca! You made me blush a little! I'm very glad our family is so close and we can share in each others joys and sorrow and be there for each other. I love you and can't wait to see you in just over a month!!
