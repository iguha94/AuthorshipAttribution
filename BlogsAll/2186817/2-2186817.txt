          HIGHER POWER   From the earliest beginnings of mankind, we have looked to nature and the heavens for a creator.  When the hunt was good and there was plenty to eat, we thanked the gods and when the weather turned against us, we feared them.  As mankind moved away from tribes who focused exclusively on hunting and formed villages with an emphasis on farming, the idea of God transitioned as well.  They became the figurehead for a particular purpose or need in the community.  Female fertility godesses appeared to bring abundance in farming and producing children.  By the rise of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome, the gods and godesses had involved into three-dimensional characters that had detailed origins and histories.  With flair and personlity their adventures told the story of how the world was made and what particular influence they had over mankind.  They were very similar to the Justice League of America (JLA), which is the fictious organization whose members consist of Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, etc.    Next, the idea of one and only one God came to be for a brief time in Egypt and eventually with the Hebrew people who longed to separate themselves as much as possible from the gentiles.  The new and improved one God proved very helpful.  He led the Hewbrews out of Egypt and provided mana from the heavens before eventually leading them into the promised land.  The relationship with the Hebrew God of the Old Testament was often a rocky one as the Hebrews sometimes fell out of His pleasure.  This God was a jealous God and would smite someone at the drop of a hat.  However, in the New Testament, Jesus spoke of a kind, loving Father who only wanted His children to forgive and love one another.  This was a far cry from the God of the Old Testament.  I sometimes find it helpful to think of it using this analogy: God of the Old Testament equals God before prozac; and the God of the New Testament equals God after prozac.  It was really quite a change in personality.  Various churches have painted different images of God over the past 2,000 years and many people in the United States grow up seeing themselves as sinners unworthy of the love from their judgmental God.  We are to accept what church leaders tell us without questioning.  We become sheep and do not have a personal relationship with God, but instead our interaction is mediated by a third party.  Over the last fifty years or so more and more people have begun to think for themselves and have left the churches.  In time, they find themselves longing for a connection with their creator, but refuse to accept the God they have been given in the past.  In fact, some people have been victimized by some church members in such a way that they may be uncomfortable using the name God.  That’s okay.  Find another a name that feels comfortable and begin using that name instead.  It may be Lord, Allah, Godess, the Universe or even just your Higher Power.  Use this name for as long as you like.  If one day it no longer feels appropriate, choose the name that feels right at that time.  You can always change it later if you feel so led.  More people are beginning to expand their consciousness of the world around them and in doing so our concept of God is changing too.  Most people no longer see God as a bearded man on a throne in the heavens.  God has now taken on the persona of an unconditional loving energy who wants the very best for you.  There is nothing you can do that will cause God to forsake that unconditional love for you.  God loves you and has loved you even if you have been angry at God for things that have happened in your life and had to turn away from God for a while.  God does not insist that we suffer or feel unworthy.  God wants us to feel worthy of His love and in accepting this idea, we find that we are able to open ourselves up to more good.   From The Foxhole   After the events of September 11,2001, Orlando found himself lost and needing comfort, but did not feel worthy to turn to God because he had previously divorced his wife and threw himself into his career.  The following Sunday, he visited a local church and reconnected with God.  "I realized that it didn't matter that my wife and I had divorced and I had run away from the pain by focusing all my attention on work.  Like the story of the Prodigal Son, God was just happy to have me come home."  Linda had been excommunicated from the church she grew up in after confiding in her youth minister that she was a lesbian.  Feeling abandoned by both God and her church family, Linda walked away from the church for over fifteen years since she could not reconcile her sexuality with her religion.    One afternoon, Linda was hiking in the mountains and looked out at the view before her.  "It was so breathe taking I had to sit down.  I looked out at the creation before me and realized I was homesick for a relationship with my creator.  A thought came to me that religion and spirituality are not the same thing. It was so storng I began to read as many books as I could on spirituality. I soon realized that God didn't care who I slept with and in time, I decided the name Godess felt more comfortable to me and being outdoors in nature is my church.  Whenever I feel disconnected, I go outdoors and look at all the beauty around me and I no longer feel alone.  If I have a question, an answer will often come to me."   Toolbox   Just for today, imagine that God is with you at all times, loving you and supporting you.  When challenges come up, just for grins, ask God for assistance and see what happens.  Imagine that God is giving you the answer.  Don’t worry if you feel that you’re making it up, just go along with it and see what happens.  Being aware of God takes practice, but in time you will definitely see the results.  Get comfortable, close your eyes and relax.  Think about a higher power for a few moments.  Focus on what you feel.  Is there a name that comes to mind for this higher power?  Is it God?  Allah?  Jesus?  Lord?  The Universe?  Godess?  Spirit? Or maybe just Higher Power?  Choose a name for God and begin using it.  If you find in time, that this name no longer feels comfortable, choose a new one at that time.  Spend some time in nature and look at God’s handiwork.  Watch a sunset and marvel at the way the colors melt in the evening sky.  Drive to the mountains and experience the awe of these huge formations of rock.  Go to the beach and allow the rhythm of crashing waves to lull you into a peaceful state.  Remind yourself that the Universe not only created these amazing works of nature, it also created you.  Therefore, you must be something special as well.  Be willing to consider this idea, even if it feels strange or uncomfortable.   Affirmation    I am now aware of my Higher Power in my world.                </post>
