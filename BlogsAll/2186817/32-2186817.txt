It snowed again today! Of course I decided that I needed to get some shopping done today, so I trekked 15 blocks in the wind and snow down to Steinway Street to buy clothes for my nephews for midnight Mass, which happens to be at 10 pm this year. Huh? Oh well, more important things to ponder these days. Ok, so after the clothes for the boys, I then decided they needed shoes. Cowboy boots for Bryant it is then. Alright, so I trekked the 15 blocks back to my apartment to meet Cindy and Jackson. They were only here for about 30 minutes before Chris called me. "Please don't hate me," he says, "but I left my resignation letter for the Westin at home and I need you to bring it to me. By the way, did you know it was snowing?" OK, so at 3 pm, Cindy & Jackson scooted off and I headed into the city, dropped off the letter, stole a kiss from my man and then hopped on the 7 train and went to Amanda's to help with her holiday cookies. Home by 7 pm to watch WWE Armageddon. Busy day.  Tomorrow is our company's holiday party. I usually end up drinking a bit too much wine at this thing and then dancing my socks off. I plan to stick to beer this year in the hopes of no hangover!! Wish me luck! There's always an after party, which I have yet to make it to. The bad thing about this whole deal is that we have to go to work the next day. Half show up and out of those half, they show up late. I'm surprised they show up at all.  In case I don't get to post tomorrow, I would like to say:    HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAD!!          I'm going home to Louisiana this Saturday for a whole week! I'm pretty excited, but I'm exhasted thinking of all the things that still need to get done before I leave. And, I still need to finish getting 11 more Christmas gifts. I'm sure I'll be having a Bloody Mary just as soon as they pull out the beverage cart on the 8 am flight to Atlanta from NYC. By the end of the week, I'll have deserved it twice-fold. Before I hit the publish button, I just wanted to say:   THEY CAPTURED SADDAM HUSSEIN!! FINALLY!!  GO USA!
