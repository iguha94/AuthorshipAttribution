So my efforts at trying to post each day of my Christmas vacation failed miserably. Sucks for you, kid. All in all, good times indeed! Indeed. As reported, I held an alligator for the very first time in my life. Not so bad. My flights went well and during my 2 hour layover in Atlanta on the way back, I had an appointment with an endless bowl of chips & salsa from Chili's and a Corona. I ended up buying myself a silver band for my thumb. Momma likes. It was a WONDERFUL Christmas vacation!! I, however, have come to the realization that I cannot spend a holiday as important as Christmas away from Chris.  I've been so out of the loop in the news world that I didn't even know there was an earthquake in Iran or mudslides in Utah, etc. In truth, I couldn't figure out how to work my Dad's satellite TV. I must admit that I'm a little ashamed of myself, too. I'm surrounded by technology and I can't figure out how to watch my favorite channels on satellite. Dumbass.  I found this interesting little website of   found notes . Neat site. You should visit. And then I found another site for someone who decided to take the whole cell phone matter into his own hands by "  rearranging " it.  And this next one is just about the scariest thing I think I've ever seen.   Ugly sweaters, really fast .   And for all of you with time on your hands: the   Michael Jackson  game. OK, so it's kind of lame, but you're the one who's bored. Not me.
