Ok, so I've been home for about 2 1/2 days and I'm just now able to post. It's been busy so far. I can't comment on any news this time around as I haven't stopped long enough to watch anything on TV. As soon as I landed in Alexandria, La on Saturday, we ate at Cracker Barrel. Then, we drove to Rayville to go see my grandparents and my in-laws. We did a little present swapping, ate some good ole deep-fried chicken and then watched the Blue Collar Comedy Tour starring Jeff Foxworthy. Too funny! My sister-in-law, Cacky, recorded it from Comedy Central one night. Good work, Cacky dahlin, good work! I got all kinds of good stuff for Christmas already and it's only the 22nd!! I just want to point out that I haven't even worn my coat since I landed. It's been in the 50's or 60's during the day. Crazy!! Oh! And I held a couple of alligators just about an hour ago. I took a picture with them, too! Their snouts were taped shut so they wouldn't bite anyone. My little nephew, Bryant, was a little scared of them but he stuck it out for the pics.  This morning, Mom, Dad & I got in the car to go to Shreveport for a little shopping. The car didn't want to start, but Dad coaxed it and it came to life. We took it back to the dealership since they've only had it about a month. Turns out that a rat crawled up in the engine and tried making a nest. It chewed through a few wires, which had to be replaced. Ended up costing about $130 plus tax. And about 2 hours of our time. However, I must say that Moffit Mazda is just the nicest car dealership you could possibly pick. Alright, Dad's making some cheese toast which happens to be an old favorite of mine, so I gotta go. Until next time . . .
