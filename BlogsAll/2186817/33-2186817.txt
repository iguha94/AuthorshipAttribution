Wow! There really isn’t jack shit happening in the news world so far today. Well, a few things, but nothing I’d like to comment on. However, last night, I found the link so that you, too, can get your   2004 Horoscope ! Lucky you! So go and find out what the New Year has in store for you!  The 12-year-old boy who accidentally killed a 6-year-old girl three years ago will finally get a new trial. I’m sure you remember this one. His defense said that it was an accident as the boy, Lionel Tate, was trying to mimic wrestling moves he’d seen on TV. He was tried as an adult, found guilty, and has served 3 years of a life sentence without parole. Personally, I don’t think he should have been tried as an adult in the first place and, luckily, they’ll now give him a new trial because the court failed to evaluate his competency before the first trial. Good for him! I just think he really didn’t mean to kill that little girl and he had no idea he could hurt her that bad. Kids that age have no idea what mortality is and all the like. I can’t believe that his attorneys let him be tried as an adult in the first place.  I got a call from my former boss, Walter LaRose, this morning so I wanted to give a shout out to all of my friends in MONROE, LOUISIANA!!
