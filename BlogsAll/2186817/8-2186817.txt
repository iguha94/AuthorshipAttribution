Today's lunch is cheese ravioli w/tomato & basil sauce from Caccina below Rockefeller Center. Not bad, though it could use more tomato sauce. It has a slight kick to it. Today is finally Friday and I did NOT start the day off on a good foot. To start with, I was bringing laundry back last night in the push cart & with the army bag on top of it when the cart tipped over and I fell on top of it. I didn't fall all the way down, though my right shin is quite bruised today. Then, this morning at Au Bon Pain, I dropped a couple of quarters then a $5 bill.  When I went to pick up the money, I lost my balance and kind of fell, but not all the way (again). Embarrassing, but at that point, I just didn't care anymore. I took my everything bagel and went & ate my breakfast at my desk, only I kept dropping my container of cream cheese on the way back from the kitchen. I just hope no one gives me a child to hold today! I'm afraid of what I might do!  On the job front, Chris started orientation today at the Mandarin Oriental. This whole thing has moved so quickly that he hasn't had time to work out what he'll do with his other job at the Westin. Luckily, he's off for a few days and doesn't have to worry about that until Sunday morning. Ok, got to go down to the messenger center in our building to pick up a food order. Until tonight . . .
