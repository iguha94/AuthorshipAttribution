Sorry, boys & girls, for the lag in posts, but we've been dealing with a family situation. I haven't really been surfing the net lately. I haven't really been able to concentrate on one thing. However, Chris and I did manage to clean out our closets last night. Instead of sharing the closets, we've decided that we would each have one closet each to ourselves. I think we're officially a married couple now. For the most part, even though we've been married for over a year (and living together for about 5 years before that), it still feels like we're roommates. But, things are beginning to move toward the other spectrum.   Chris flew out to Louisiana this morning for a funeral. He'll be back in the Big Apple Friday afternoon. We'll have Friday night together and then I fly to Louisiana on Saturday morning for a little Christmas vacation with my family. I'll try to post from there, but if I miss a day or two, we'll all somehow survive, I'm sure. I plan on getting my hair cut and add more blond highlights while I'm down there. It's just cheaper, damn it. It amazes me that quite a few women that I work with spend about $150 on their hair each time they go. And they go very regularly - about every 8 to 10 weeks. Insane!  I've nearly finished my Christmas shopping and I'm very proud of myself, if not a little astonished by my power-shopping ability. If I don't finish buying gifts up here, then I'll have to finish shopping at my old buddy: Pecanland Mall in Monroe, La. I used to work at Deck the Walls (picture frame shop) when I first started college. Great times!! Pecanland has always been good to me. Last time I was home, my mother-in-law (Daisie, we'll call her) and I went through like 6 stores in less than an hour. We're animals! But I must confess, I really can't keep up with her when she's going full steam for some long-term shopping. I don't know how she does it. My Mom used to be the same way. I just haven't shopped with her lately, so I don't know if she's slowed down any yet.   Must send a big shout out to COURT as I was mentioned on her blog the other day. You should definitely read her blog along with the others that I have linked to the right of this post. I wouldn't waste your time. I promise. As a matter of fact, I was inspired in some way or another by each one.  Wow! I've just discovered that you can actually bid on eBay for your very own   Imaginary Online Girlfriend . What the f*ck?!?The bids range from $3 to $50. I wonder how much I would pull in?   And I'm sure you've heard that:   MIT SCIENTIST PENS WORLD'S LARGEST BOOK BY FAR  (courtesy Foxnews.com) A 133-pound tome about the Asian country of Bhutan that uses enough paper to cover a football field and a gallon of ink has been declared the world's largest published book. Author Michael Hawley, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it's not a book to curl up with at bedtime Ã‚Â— "unless you plan to sleep on it." Each copy of "Bhutan: A Visual Odyssey Across the Kingdom," is 5-by-7 feet, 112 pages and costs about $2,000 to produce. Hawley is charging $10,000 to be donated to a charity he founded, Friendly Planet, which has built schools in Cambodia and Bhutan.
