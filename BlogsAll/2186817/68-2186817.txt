I'm sure most everyone is watching the Super Bowl today. Hell, I even know a few people who actually went all the way to Houston to watch it all in person. Ah, the perks of knowing people in the business. They don't get the tickets for free, but they at least get a chance to buy decent tickets. I hope they're having a blast! For the rest of us sitting at home watching all of the pre-game mumbo gumbo, here's a little something to help while away the time:  This next couple may take a little bit to load, but hysterically disturbing, nonetheless. Not something to watch with impressionable kids around. Part 1:   Stick Figure Penalty  Part 2:   Stick Figure Penalty: Chamber 2   This next one is long, but worth it. It's interactive and has loads of violence. Enjoy!   Ray - Part 1   And the   Bug on a Wire  game is always fun!  Ok, little ones, I'm off to watch more Super Bowl mumbo gumbo and pray that my darling husband will do the laundry like he said he would do. Just earlier he called me and offered me $50 to do it for him, but I did it the last few times all by myself and I think it's just his turn already. Besides, I know he'd probably never actually hand over that money so I'm just saving myself extra work. And he had 3 days off this weekend. He's Mr. Procrastinator! And I am his lovely bride. Tee Hee!
