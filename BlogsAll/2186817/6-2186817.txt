Today is my 2nd day of sitting in for the Presidentâ€™s assistant. I have a feeling (and hope) that today will be even duller than this past Friday. Laurren, the presidentâ€™s assistant, is in California for about 6 weeks working on her acting career. This weekend I was pretty lazy, but then again, when has my weekend been exciting lately? I made King Ranch Chicken Casserole yesterday evening and it is pretty good, but it doesnâ€™t beat my Momâ€™s.  Big CONGRATULATIONS go out to JASON & JENNIFER WHITTINGTON, who just got married this past Saturday in Natchitoches, La.  New findings from this weekend: there is a device called an Octadog, which turns an ordinary hotdog into an octopus you can eat. Interesting and just a bit scary as well! (MSRP $16.95) I also discovered a popcorn fork â€“ so you donâ€™t have to worry about getting that pesky butter all over your fingers cause I know thatâ€™s always been my biggest problem!! Todayâ€™s discovery is: â€œSnapple Pieâ€ hits store shelves. OK, itâ€™s not an actual pie but an apple pie flavored Snapple drink. Itâ€™s only available for a limited time (Oct-Dec 2003) to coincide with apple picking and the holiday season. Do I dare try this one?  OK, now onto this whole David Blaine stunt. I canâ€™t figure out why anyone would want to literally starve themselves for, what, 44 days?!? Publicity? Is he just that vain? I donâ€™t know. Now the guy will have to be weaned back onto solid foods. I mean is that the sort of thing that tickles his fancy? I guess we all know what our own reactions would be to that sort of proposition. You certainly didnâ€™t catch me hanging from a cardboard box suspended 10 feet above the ground behind my Queens apartment building, now did you?  Oh, and now for the kicker: There are reports that Prince (yep, the rock star, Prince) has been going from door to door to door sharing his Jehovahâ€™s witness faith in the Minneapolis area. Now if that isnâ€™t strange . . .
