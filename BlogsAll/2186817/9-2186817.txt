I just found the coolest website for ordering   80s t-shirts  and memorabilia for all of you holiday shoppers out there. That's all I really have today since I'm on cleaning duty today. I've already done part 1 of dishes and I have just a few more to do, but I ran out of drying space. Go figure. Stupid small apartment. After my coffee and then shower, I'll be off to do laundry which I have done in nearly 2 weeks. Good thing I stocked up on underwear last time I was in Louisiana!  I've discovered that visitors to my website who are using a Macintosh have trouble clicking on my links. I will eventually get the links added to this blog site so that you may access pictures from here. Unfortunately, I don't know a lick about html code as I've just been winging it up until now. I'll have to find out more since the "easy-to-use" wizards that I used to set up these sites is no longer available to me. So much for resting a bit and sitting pretty. Time to get back to work and learn me something. Who knows, if I figure it all out, maybe I can work something out with the Natchitoches Times (newspaper) so they can update their own website and I can read all of the local hometown dirt from the comfort of my leather Administrative Assistant's chair on the 36th floor Rockefeller Center. Perhaps I can teach Becca when I go home at Christmas and she can update their site and thereby pay her more money. Note to Becca - discuss with Charles! You never really know until you ask. And this way, they won't have to contract the job out.
