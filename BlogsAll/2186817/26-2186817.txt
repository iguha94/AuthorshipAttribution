Wow! We saw it all last night, I think! We went to a Widespread Panic concert at Madison Square Garden, which was the 1st time any of us had been to MSG. We had a great time but you should have heard some of the comments as we walked through the Times Square subway station on our way to the concert. Chris was a Redneck Alien Trucker and Olivia & I were Angel Sluts. Don't know if that's what we had in mind when we picked out our costumes, but that's what we ended up with. Check out the pictures in Gallery 3 - we saw: a glow worm, cheerleaders, fairies, butterflies, girls scouts, scooby-doo, 80's man, princesses, the Pope, Hawaiian girls (I mean, men), chicken man, the gingerbread man, candy corn, walking Christmas trees, Goth girls, Austin Powers, devils, cat women, stop light girl, TV man, etc. You name it, we probably saw it! Including the guy I spotted in nothing but a speedo. Thankfully, that one wasn't too close to where we were sitting! At one point, I went to the bathroom & Chris went to get beer. I come back from the bathroom & Chris is standing up there placing his order while some girl is trying to kiss him. She liked his Alien Redneck Trucker teeth.  My wings broke just before the end of the concert, but I think I can repair them. My feet were hurting so bad by the end of the night & we ended up walking like 10 blocks from 33rd Street to 42nd Street trying to catch a cab. Never found one! We ended up squeezing onto the 7 train at Bryant Park and taking it into Queens and transferred to the N train. Got home just before 2 am. All in all, good times all around! OK, off to soak my aching feet! And to store my wig & wings until they're needed once more in this City of Dreams.
