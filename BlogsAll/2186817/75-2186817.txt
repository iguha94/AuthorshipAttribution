Funny thing happened to us on the way to the Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) last night.  We're in a cab in Astoria heading for the bridge to Manhattan when my window was struck by an orange.  Yes, an orange.  I'm just thankful that the window didn't shatter.  Fucked up.  Anyway, we went to 2 shows last night at UCB and had a great time.  We had to sit on the floor for the 2nd show and that was fine until about the last 20 minutes.  Pain, pain, pain.  I felt bad for stretching my legs out every now and then, but I really couldn't help it.  All in all, an ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC show!!  So then here I am at home by myself today and I do a few things around the house, i.e. vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom, washing dishes and the like.  Then I decide to make some gumbo, so I head down to the grocery store to get supplies.  I buy my groceries and head home, start cutting up onions, bell pepper & celery when it dawns on me that I've forgotten to get sausage.  OK, so back down to the grocery store and find out that they don't have the right kind of sausage.  So I debate on whether to go to another store and then decide to go & it takes me only about 2 minutes to find what I need but 10 minutes to get through the check-out line.  I book it back to the apartment and finish up making the gumbo.  Needless to say, it turned into a bigger ordeal than I thought it would have been.
