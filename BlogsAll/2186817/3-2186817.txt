Another busy day! After I left work 35 minutes late yesterday, the plan to get these presentation books copied & out the door (via overnight to L.A.) was for me to walk the book about 5 or 6 blocks to Kinko’s and have them make the 27 copies over the course of about 2 hours. Then I would have to go pick them up, bring them back to the office, hole-punch and then spiral-bind each one. Oh, and insert dividers for each of the 3 section. Not too bad, except that I wasn’t going to get the presentation until around Noon. Now, all of that has changed. Our Production Dept. will be able to complete the job on time for me to send them out today. However, I am now at the Production Dept’s beck & call for the rest of the day. Oh well, so much for a nice leisurely day without the boss.  On the laundry front, I was supposed to do them on Sunday; however, I kept Jackson on Sunday and didn’t get a chance to do them. Mondays are too busy to do them after work. So then my plan was to prep them and do them just as soon as I walked in the door from work yesterday. As noted, I was about 45 minutes late getting home yesterday so that ruled laundry duty. But today is the day!! I don’t care if I’m doing them at 10 o’clock tonight because we need our underwear back!! I’m trying to clear up my Thursday night so that I can go over to Amanda’s and meet her cousin. Friday night, Olivia, Chris and I are going to the Widespread Panic concert at Madison Square Garden. We might even be able to score some backstage passes and party with the band afterward since Amanda’s cousin is a groupie and can get us in. This all remains to be seen since I haven’t actually met this cousin of hers. If we don’t party with the band, then I think Olivia and I will be going to Hogs & Heffers, which is the bar made famous by the movie Coyote Ugly. I plan on recovering Saturday, so that rules out laundry on that day! Busy, busy!  OK, now off to find some lunch and then back to the grindstone!
