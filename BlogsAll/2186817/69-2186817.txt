Last Friday, I honed by flower arranging skills once again.  The president of our company has a vineyard in Australia and at harvest time each season, he has flowers from the vineyard shipped to our offices.  My friend (and coworker), Laurren, and I do most of the arranging.  Another friend, Dawn, sometimes helps out - but she's usually busier than we are.  Anyway, we ended up making like 7 or 8 arrangements from these 2 boxes and these are some of the most exotic flowers I've ever seen.  They have this one flower called a protea, which actually comes from bush, and it looks like that plant/flower from  Little Shop of Horrors  that at any point could jump out and eat you.     Otherwise, not too much has been happening.  I was in one crazy ass mood this past weekend.  You know the kind when you've started evaluating certain areas of your life and you don't like what you see but you can't blame anyone but yourself?  Yeah, I was in that mood Saturday and Sunday.  Chris & I were supposed to be going to Peter Luger's Steakhouse again tonight with some of his friends from The Essex House (hotel), but those plans changed.  Now, I think we're going to slip out to a couple of shows at Upright Citizens Brigade.  Should be loads of fun since we haven't been in a little over a week.  Ok, off to powder the nose and then off to the show.  Later gators.  Oh!  And I knew I said I would do the links today - and I might still after we get back - but if I don't, tough shit.  You'll get them when you're ready for them.  Now behave!
