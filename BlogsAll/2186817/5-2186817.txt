FRIDAY! YEAH, FRIDAY! Chris and some of his new friends from the Mandarin Oriental are supposed to go bowling tonight at Chelsea Piers. They have black light bowling at this place. Even the pins glow in the dark! I wish I were going, but alas, I don’t think I’m invited. Maybe some time soon Cindy, Jackson, Chris and I can go and have some fun!   When you think of New York City, you think about how crowded it is with all of these millions of people, Times Square, cars honking, yellow cabs rushing past, Central Park, city buses and subway trains. As far as city pets are concerned, you’d also think most people would stick to the usual house cats and dogs of various sizes. Animals such as a dozen snakes, an alligator or a tiger would seem to be somewhat far-fetched, right? Not so, my friend, no so. But I can at least say that these animals seem to be confined to Harlem or the Upper West Side of Manhattan anyway. Let’s just hope they don’t find any of these pets in Queens.  In the news: A Swedish tourist tried to smuggle eight baby snakes into Australia. They found four venomous baby king cobras and four baby emerald tree boas strapped to his legs in homemade pouches. The cobras had died during the nine-hour flight, but the boas survived. He had planned to sell the snakes for $3500 in order to fund an eight-day vacation.  OK, flu shot done! I’m a big girl, I didn’t cry or pass out – go me!! Now my arm hurts though. It hurts more now than it did when she stuck my arm with the needle.
