I will now be referring to Chris as Chris the Great.  Why?  Because his hands built the world, baby!  I came home at lunch today because I was so exhausted.  After eating some lunch, I took a 2 hour nap.  I NEVER take naps.  Ever.  So it was a little strange.  Maybe I'm coming down with something.  Oh well.  Your gain because I feel like doing a little link whorage today:    Can you imagine not know what sex is ?  Now try to imagine being married for 8 years and then going to a fertility clinic because they haven't been able to have a child.  Why, you ask?  Because they've never had sex and had no idea what it was.  Very, very strange - especially in this day and age!  This is one of the silliest inventions I think I've ever seen.    It's a foil sleeve for driver's who put one arm out of the window as they drive.   It kind of defeats the purpose.  Just what every new couple needs to compliment their bedroom -   a quilt made out of Crown Royal bags .  I think I'll skip this one, thanks.    Another strange website that follows your mouse .  Interesting, but not as fancy as some we've seen in the past.    Can you spot the differences ?  I must admit that I'm not the best at it, but it's still fun.    This is an interesting take on an online clock.  Kind of nice .  And finally, you can create your own   South Park character .  I had a chick with wings and claws.  Her name was Betty.
