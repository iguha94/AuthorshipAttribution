Stomach growling, feeling faint, must eat soon . . . so, I'm a little hungry and about to make some chicken alfredo pasta cause I'm a badass.  And Chris will love it - except that I forgot to get the kind of pasta that he loves, but tough shit.  I'm not getting dressed again to go back down to the store in the cold and the wind.  April in NYC - ain't it grand?  While I'm sitting here typing, The Rock is on Conan O'Brien and it reminded me to tell everyone: Chris met The Rock last week when he was staying at The Mandarin Oriental (hotel).  Interestingly enough, he checked in under the name of "Mr. Cook."  He only stayed like 1 night and then moved on.  I could eat him with a spoon!  Visitor update: Ruthie, Cacky & Savannah are coming up on the 15th for 4 days.  Becca & Trevor are coming up at the end of May for her 21st birthday.  Then, Brad & Adrianna are coming up at the end of June and, last but not least, there is a possibility that we'll get to see our friend Hiroshi after summer when he flies in from Las Vegas to visit a friend here in NYC.  That's it so far this year.    Oh!  The piece de resistance (of course) is our upcoming trip to Italy.  We've finally narrowed it down to staying in just Italy: 3 days in Rome, 3 days in Florence (with a day trip to Pisa), and 3 days in Venice.  I SO can't wait!  Chris and I have never been to Europe - hell, I don't think we've ever really taken a trip together by ourselves!  And that's saying a lot considering we've been together for 9 years (married 2 and a half years).  Ok, off to make dinner so I can EAT!!
