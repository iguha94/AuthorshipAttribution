She had such a fucked weekend.  It all started Friday with too much to drink.  On Saturday, he just wouldn't quit calling her names.  He said he was just picking on her, but she'd had enough.  The whole situation pissed her off.  To top it all off, he began lecturing her on getting a new job.  She doesn't know why he thinks she hates her job so much.  She's told him time and time again that she likes her job.  She likes the people she works with.  Why does he keep telling her that she needs to find another job - one that she'll actually enjoy going to.  How many times does she have to tell him?  And now she's left by herself the whole day to contemplate the past few days.  She wakes up feeling inadequate.  She feels like a loser.  She doesn't like how she feels about herself or her situation.  And that seems to be the problem with her.  People push and push her in directions that aren't her own.  She's played everyone else's games for the past few years.  Now she feels stifled and ignored and yet she knows that her situation won't change unless she takes hold of the reins.  That one little step is the scariest and she knows it, but she's tired of feeling this way.  She can see a fight coming soon.  A big one.  One that will affect her in many ways.  And yet she knows that it will only affect those areas in her life that she allows it to affect.  She has to be in control again.   *all stories are fiction
