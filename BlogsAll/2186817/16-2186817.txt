WOW! I am tee-total tired! And yet, well, actually I was going to say something along the lines of: since I've been so busy or since I haven't been able to devote more time to my blogs as of late . . . but truthfully, I just feel like blogging one more time on this lovely November Monday. Amanda is coming over in about an hour to watch wrestling with me and I can't decide if I want to cook or not. To be honest, I really don't   want   to cook, but I don't necessarily want to spend the money on take-out. OK, that's not quite right either. It's really "ordering in" because we all know at this point in the day, I'm not getting dressed again to go outside. My feet hurt. Darn boots.  Nothing too exciting is happening in my life right now. Chris is working, working and I'll get to see him again on Friday - except for the 20 minutes or so I see him during the 4 am hour to rouse him out of bed by scratching his back. Maybe that's why it takes him 4 tries to get up, but probably not. I mean, if I only got 4 hours of sleep a night 5 days a week, it would probably take many tries before I got out of bed. Don't know how he does it.  Berg, our cat, just threw up on the living room carpet. Gee, thanks. Darn hairballs. Which reminds me, but I can't really remember if I blogged about this the other day, anyway, this lady brought her 3-year-old child to a doctor to have a huge hairball removed from the girl's stomach. Turns out that she has that disease that makes you pull your hair out at the roots -   Trichotillomannia . Kind of crazy - and that was what I was reminded of just then. Thanks Berg! Hopefully someone has learned something today - even if it's only that there is a disease out there for pulling out your hair. Good boy! Down Berg - don't attack. He's such an angry cat. Alright, now I'm heading off to order in some supper. It'll either be pizza or Chinese. Probably Chinese.
