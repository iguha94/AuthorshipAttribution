Nice long weekend. I needed it. On Saturday, Chris & I went to Down the Hatch with Olivia, Michael, Derrick, Anne & Caroline. $18, about 10 or 12 pitchers of beer later & too many hot wings to count, we left Down the Hatch and took in the 9 pm show at the UCB. Pictures from our outing are in the Gallery 4 album. My stomach did NOT like me the next day! Nothing too exciting as the sidewalks are too iced over to really go anywhere, though Amanda & I did go to Home Depot this morning. I nearly killed myself on the commute. And then I did laundry. I lost count how many times I nearly busted it.  Just in time, the   State of the Union drinking game !  OK, this next link is just bizarre. Check out these lovely   mail order husbands . If this is what I had to choose from, I think I'd choose to be a lesbian. Yeah, the guy looking for an addition to his wives club or the cyberstalker - I'm having a hard time choosing.  In case you're looking for a gag gift: clothes that make you look like you're naked. Click   here .  And just what every boy wants (but too bad it happened to a girl), Teenage girl's x-ray vision baffles scientists. Russian scientists have been unable to disprove a teenage girl who claims she has x-ray vision and can see inside human bodies. Click   here  to read.  And here's something you don't see every day:   slugs mating .  And a study by the US Government of an artist drawings under the   influence of LSD . These are quite interesting and a must read/look.
