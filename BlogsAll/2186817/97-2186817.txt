Tonight is the big finale for American Idol. I didn't watch the first 2 seasons and the only reason I tuned in this season was because they cancelled Buffy. So really, what's a girl to do?   I couldn't let this headline pass by without comment:   Spanky the Circus Clown Charged With Child Porn . Ok, I think the name "Spanky" should have sent up red flags to start with.  I just tried to get our passports and had one of the most confusing conversations I think I've ever had.  I think I might need to get my hearing checked.  That's probably my problem right there, but I'm actually afraid I'll need hearing aids or something & I'm just too young for that.  It's really frustrating when you can't hear people.  I think I know how my Dad feels sometimes.  Anyway, I did the unthinkable yesterday: I unleashed Chris the Great in Best Buy unsupervised.  I don't know what I was thinking.  He came back with one movie in particular:   Bubba Ho-Tep .  It was one of the craziest, funniest movies I've seen in a long time!  I'd recap, but I'm not sure I would even know where to start.  It's a great movie so go see it!!  I just went to   Rita's site , took   this quiz  and found out that I'm a CENTRIST, which means: Centrists favor selective government intervention and emphasize practical solutions to current problems. They tend to keep an open mind on new issues. Many centrists feel that government serves as a check on excessive liberty.    Ok, so now what?
