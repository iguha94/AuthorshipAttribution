I wanted to get on the computer yesterday to post, but I was busier than a one-armed paperhanger. And I don't know why I'm so frustrated today, but I think it's going to get better as the day goes on. It is so absolutely beautiful outside today that I don't see how I could stay in a rotten mood. Normally, I go downstairs to get lunch and then come right back to my desk to eat, but I just couldn't today. So Dawn and I ate outside at Rockefeller Center right next to the skating rink, but above 1 level. Beautiful!!  So I went to see The Passion of the Christ again yesterday and it is a phenomenal movie. Please go see this movie! If nothing else, it brings a human aspect to the story of Christ - something that I think was missing during all of my years in catechism. Some people cried, some didn't, some flinched each time Jesus was beaten, some didn't, and some couldn't  take it at all and left the theater. Each moviegoer had a different experience and this is the type of movie that makes you reflect. Just what a good - I mean GREAT - movie should do. Fantastic job, Mel Gibson, fantastic job!  Good news is you are obese and you've done something drastic to help lower your weight - you can   deduct it from your taxes ! But since I'm not a tax consultant, please don't reference this site when you get a knock on your door from the IRS. You are not my child and I will not take responsibility for your tax shortcomings. Frankly, the IRS scares the hell out of me.  Here's something you don't see everyday: A town in Vermont,   Killington , wants to succeed from Vermont and join New Hampshire. Wild! I haven't heard of any sort of succession since the Civil War, and well, technically, I didn't hear that directly.
