Iâ€™ve never considered myself a sports fan. I mean, Iâ€™ve gone to a Mets game, but that was over a year ago (August 2001). During that outing, I purchased: a Mike Piazza jersey, the commemorative beer cup and various eats/beer that tinkered on the verge of $100 for the day. I had a blast, but it was an expensive outing nonetheless. Fast forward to the ALCS 2003: NY Yankees vs. Boston Red Sox. Iâ€™ll admit that Iâ€™m not glued to the TV as soon as it comes on, but Iâ€™ve actually been pulling for the Yankees (Amanda pulls for the Red Sox). Chris and I actually sat down Saturday night and watched one of the games â€“ OK, so he fell asleep while I watched the game. And I was just as shocked as everyone else when a fan reached out and snatched the ball away from the Cubs preventing them from making the 2nd out in the 8th inning in last nightâ€™s game. Iâ€™m no diehard, but Iâ€™m wondering where this newfound interest in baseball is coming from. Incidentally, last night Chris ending up having to work a little late at the Westin due to the Red Sox coming in.  They always seem to stay at the Westin, which is nice for Chris since they tip well, but their luggage rolled in shortly afterwards and they ended up doing room drops.  But as long as they tip well . . .  By the way, if youâ€™re keeping count, todayâ€™s lunch will either consist of a chicken, broccoli & cheese hot pocket or (if Iâ€™m being bad) a salad, which will cost about $7.  IN THE NEWS: I just read â€œRome Rocks to Mother Teresa, the musical.â€ And then I read another story where a 9-month pregnant woman chased a 4-year-old kid around a McDonaldâ€™s restaurant and rubbed hot French fries in his face after he spilled ice cream on her shirt. What is this world coming to, I ask you? Ok, so in case you are unaware, I read news websites all the livelong day while at work trying to keep myself occupied.  I do work when I have it, but for the most part, I have enough spare time to visit about 10 to 12 news sites a day along with other sites.
