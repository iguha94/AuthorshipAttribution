Ah! Elevator Episodes! What are Elevator Episodes, you ask? Well, you see, at work I go down for coffee every afternoon around 2:30 pm with some friends. When the mood strikes us and there isn't anyone else in the elevator we work with, we start these louder-than-usual conversations about random things - can't get into details. We like to stay covert in our operations. It's funny when one our lips are quivering because we're having a hard time keeping a straight face or we're counting floors because we're about to pop a stitch. I wonder if we're really having as much fun as we think we're having or if we're just delirious by that point in the day. Ah, who cares.  My Dad sent me the following today and I just had to share: Southernisms  Well, butter my butt and call me a biscuit.  It's been hotter'n a goat's butt in a pepper patch.  He fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down.  It's so dry the trees are bribing the dogs.  He's as country as cornflakes.  This is gooder'n grits.  Busier than a cat covering crap on a marble floor.  If things get any better, I may have to hire someone to help me enjoy it.  I'm bout as nervous as a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.  Busy as a moth in a mitten.  Happy as a clam at high tide.
