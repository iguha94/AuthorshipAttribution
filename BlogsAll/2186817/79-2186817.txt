Well, not much news on this Saturday.  Chris, Sergio & I went to Best Buy, Game Stop & Sports Authority today in Sunnyside.  I picked up some workout clothes & a new sports bra along with a jump rope.  Sergio says that jumping rope will be lower impact than running, so I'm giving it try.  Only problem is that I'll have to go outside to jump rope since it's 9 feet long and hits everything/one around me in the living room.  NYC apartments are a little small for my tastes.  Then, we picked up Jackson on our way back to the apartment.  He's spending the night with us while his mom goes out on a date.  She'll pick him up sometime tomorrow.  So once we got here, we ordered pizza and watched  School of Rock  with Jack Black.  Cute movie and a must have for the teenage'd ones in your life.  That's my day in a nutshell - sadly I'm not leaving much out.  It's been that slow today.  And now I need to go scoop out Berg's litterbox so he doesn't dig a whole into the basement.
