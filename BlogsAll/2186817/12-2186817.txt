I realize this must seem a strange statement to my friends and family back home, but with all of these tall buildings here in the city, you donâ€™t actually see the sun. Iâ€™m so glad that today is Friday! It felt weird not having to wake Chris up at 4 something this morning, but I automatically woke up anyway.

I agree.  To lose one pound, it is necessary to cheat the body of 3,500 calories â€” say, 500 a day for a week, or 350 a day for 10 days.
