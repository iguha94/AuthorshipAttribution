Cacky is safely back in Roxie, MS taking care of her aching and sore husband, John, who was in a car accident this past Saturday night. Luckily, he’s just sore and no more. We had a great time with Cacky during her trip. We went out to eat Friday night and then to an Irish pub for some live music where a homeless/bag man came inside to dance to the rhythm of the night. He made friends with some guys who bought him drinks. Of course, the more he drank, the more he kept trying to go on stage. The bar keep, James, finally had to tell him to either sit or get out. On Saturday, we hit the stores while Chris kept Jackson. Jackson scored 2 video games out of the deal. We were done with shopping around 4:30 pm and then went home to get ready for dinner & the Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) later that night. Good times indeed! I’ll be adding the pictures under the Gallery 3 link on our homepage, but for some reason, I was having problems adding pictures this weekend. I’ll try again later.  As far as the stress meter is concerned, things are pretty shaky all around. Just when things seemed to be getting better, we’re hit with another curve ball. I’m hoping we can make it to the end of the game before one team calls forfeit and walks away. Only time will tell at this point.  I’ve been so busy today at work that I really haven’t had a chance to go full throttle at my blog today, so until tomorrow . . .
