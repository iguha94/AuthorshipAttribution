So not much happening tonight.  Chris went to Peter Luger's Steakhouse in Brooklyn with some of his friends from the hotel.  I opted out tonight since 1) I wasn't aware it was tonight, and 2) I really didn't feel like going.  I'm still recovering from this weekend.  I feel kind of bad for not going, but I really was somewhat blindsided by it even though Chris insists that he told me about this on Saturday.  Unfortunately, I was busier than a one armed paper hanger on Saturday.      This link  will make you somewhat crazy.  Don't really know what it has to do with epilepsy, but that's what the site says anyway.  Well, the   world's oldest mouse  celebrated his 4th birthday this past Saturday.  He is the equivalent of 136 in human years.  Happy Birthday Yoda!  And as it turns out,   Abe Vigoda is alive  today.  Who'd have guessed?  This next story tugs at my heart.  This cat now named   China, was trapped in a cardboard shipping box  for 30 days.  It somehow got trapped in a box that contained bird cages from China.  It traveled by ship to the West Coast and then by rail to Tampa where it was found.  When they brought it to the vet, it only weighed about 3 pounds.  Yes, I'm a cat person.  Here are more   pictures  from someone who had spare time and photoshop on their computer.  Interesting & freaky all at the same time - especially the   4th picture down .    And finally, here is some of the   coolest code art ever !  Just click on the names on the left.  Cool, huh?  Oh!  I simply cannot leave without singing the praises of this group of   Roman Catholic schoolgirls .  I guess they were tired of looking at his willie.
