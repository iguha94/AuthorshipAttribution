Just in time for Martha, here are the   5 cushiest prisons .  And the dumbest Wal-Mart shopper of all time - A woman was caught trying to pass off a fake $1 million bill at Wal-Mart by purchasing over $1,600 worth of merchandise.

I find it hard to believe this woman actually thought she could get away with a $1 million dollar bill. After they arrested her, they found 2 more in her purse. And the kicker is that the US Treasury doesn't even produce $1 million bills, though they are available to purchase as souvenirs at some stores.  Ah, yes,   Men in Kilts .

And is it wrong that I want a   Sperm Toilet Seat ?  And it's like $12.  Who can beat that?  This next site makes me cringe a little.  It's a guy getting shocked by   16,600 volts of electricity .
