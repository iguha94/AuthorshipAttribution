It's the end of the weekend and I'm sitting here threatening my cat, Berg, with the water bottle in an effort to keep him from scratching at the front door. I think he does it just to get sprayed. I had a paper shopping bag on the floor yesterday and he climbed inside and sat like he was the king of the bag. I took a picture of him looking all regal-like. We have so many pictures of him on our computer, he has his own folder.  This weekend was the Gallien/LaCour family reunion, which is my Mom's side of the family. I hear that everything was very nice and everyone had a lovely time. Someone scored me my very own freshly printed copy of the   Gallien Family Cookbook  . I'm very excited about it! I'm very excited to learn that my cousin, Rachael Gallien Smith, is pregnant for the 2nd time! I have more to add to that list: 3 ladies at my work - Bea, Anna & Jenn. Very exciting indeed! I wonder if 2 more people I know will also become pregnant, as they say that these things happen in 3's. Hey, the theory held true last time!  Chris is working his little toes off at the Westin today. He had to work a double like he did last week. He hasn't actually called me today so I can only assume that means that he's been very busy today. That's good since time will have gone by faster for him. Jackson came over today & we played video games and watched Daredevil. We had a good time and then he had to go home and do his homework. I'm now on the phone with Becca, so I have to go now.
