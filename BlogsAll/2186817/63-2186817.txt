Not much going on this weekend. A couple of friends came over yesterday afternoon. We just sat around and ate, drank beer watched a movie and some funny shows on TV. Good time! Plan was to go out last night, but I wasn't really feeling that well so we altered our plans. Thanks girls! Next time, we're definitely going out!

Check out   Where's George  where you can track your paper currency and see where different bills have traveled over time. You can enter in bills that are currently in your wallet after you open an account (free!), so check it out!  This next one will make you chuckle and yet I found it to be slightly disturbing.
