Nothing much going on today, except it was my friend's birthday today.  She said that she work up all depressed and sad.  I know the feeling since I sometimes fall into the sinkhole myself.  But I think her day turned out to very nice indeed.  As I'm sitting on the N train on my way home today after work, I just watch the other people.  And there are certainly different types.  For instance, there are those who read, listen to music, nap until their stop and instantly pop up when they get to their stop.  But first, we'll explore what I've to come to know as Pole-Huggers.  Pole-Huggers stand right against the pole and lean on it no matter who else is holding the pole.  You sometimes even have to pry your fingers from underneath their squishy bodies.  It grosses me out.  Then there are those who bring things to work on on the train, i.e. cross stitch, crotchet, knit, sew, homework, read papers for work, write in their journals, etc.  Just the other day, this guy from Peru approached me on the platform trying to get directions - only he doesn't speak any English.  Unfortunately, my Spanish stinks to high heaven and even though I somehow conveyed this lack of skill to this guy, he insisted on carrying on a conversation with me.  Ok, so what the hell am I to do at this point.  I figure, "yeah, why not work on my Spanish a little?"  A few words back & forth, not really understanding what's going on, I hop off the train.  This is what happens when you spend 2 years of Spanish not learning Spanish.  Ok, I've exhausted what part of my brain was left over from work today.  I must now go heat up some gumbo that I made yesterday and then plop myself down on the couch to watch some Fear Factor.  Tootles kids.
