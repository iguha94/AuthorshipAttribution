Well, instead of SoHo/East Village, Chris & I wandered aimlessly around Greenwich Village.  I absolutely love this part of the city.  It just has an energy to it that our current neighborhood in Astoria (or all of Queens for that matter) simply lacks.  One of the things Chris received when his grandmother passed away was an old pipe that his grandfather used to smoke.  So while we wandered around yesterday, he picked up a pack of vanilla pipe tobacco along with one of those little cleaning tools.  He smoked when he got home.  It didn't stink like most pipes stink thanks to the vanilla, though I must say that it was a little weird to see him smoke a pipe.  While we were out and about yesterday, we also explored the shops at the new Time Warner Center.  Nice place and very clean.  That's about all I have to say about that.  Most stores exceeded my budget.  We went into one lady's clothing store where everything was somewhat expensive, but what I noticed is that for as costly as they were, most of them were falling apart.  Call me crazy, but why would I pay $425 for a sun dress when the straps are no longer attached the garment and the ends are now all frayed.  Perhaps their manager should do a floor check and weed out some of the damaged pieces.  Perhaps I simply won't shop there & I shouldn't worry about it.  Now today, Amanda and I are supposed to go to Herald Square to find her something to wear to her sister's baby shower.  After that, we might go see Jersey Girl.  Ok, so I need to go take a shower now & rid myself of this funk.
