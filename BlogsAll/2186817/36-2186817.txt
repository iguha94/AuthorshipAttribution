Theyâ€™re predicting 4 to 7 inches of snow here in the city over the next day and a half. Should be interesting to help Sergio move his stuff from Brooklyn to Queens in the snow. They said that it wouldnâ€™t snow until later this evening, but itâ€™s already coming down pretty good. Well, the flu is really kicking some ass this year! I would say that Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™ve already had my flu shot, but the strain of influenza that is killing people out there isnâ€™t contained in the flu shot theyâ€™re handing out. Great! I got that stupid shot for nothing! All that anxiety!  There is a story out of Lafayette, La. about a little boy who received disciplinary action from his school. The mother received a call from her sonâ€™s school informing her that he had used foul words. Once she saw the disciplinary form, she got upset because he hadnâ€™t used curse words but told another student what â€œgayâ€ meant. His own mother is gay and he was explaining what it all meant. The boy was scolded in front of his class, sent to the principal's office, banned from recess and ordered to attend "behavior clinic" after his conversation with the kid. The school says that it is all a misunderstanding and that heâ€™s not being punished for discussing what it is to be gay, but because he was off task from the studentsâ€™ lesson. Now, the ACLU is involved and is threatening the school with a lawsuit. OK, in my school days, nearly every kid was off task at some point or another. I have a hard time believing that behavior clinic attendance should be required if the issue is simply being off task. Someoneâ€™s blowing smoke.  A man in Queens was issued a ticket for too much noise when his sonâ€™s balloon popped on the sidewalk. How insane is that? The man says that heâ€™ll fight the ticket in court. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m on this manâ€™s side on this one.
