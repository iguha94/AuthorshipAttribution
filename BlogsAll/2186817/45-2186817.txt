New York City is so pretty all covered in snow. It's so very cold outside. They say that you can get frostbite in just 8 minutes of exposure. I believe them! I had my leather gloves on and my fingers were so frozen. And while I'm enjoying watching the white stuff coming down, I know in the next day or so, it will all turn to solid, packed ice that forms a sheet over all of the sidewalks. What mounds of snow are left at that point will be dirty brown or yellow. Ah, snow!   At around 2:30 pm yesterday, I went downstairs to   Au Bon Pain  to get a cup of coffee. My friend (and co-worker), Laurren, went with me and talked me into getting this devilish little pastry called a cr√®me la fleur, which has cream cheese on top and inside of it. We split it and it was gone in a flash! Yum-scrum-delicious!  Now, it's Friday morning and it's 4 degress outside. I feel a sick day coming on. My boss called out yesterday saying it was too cold for him. I second that motion. As soon as I dry my hair, I'm getting back into bed with Chris.  I've stumbled upon another little blog written by fellow New Yorkers. Check it out by clicking   here . These people are really funny and I know you'll get a kick out of it.  In the news: a   watchdog group  has deemed the US military partially responsible in the deaths of two journalists killed at a Baghdad hotel during the Iraq war.  Wow! The return of   lockable luggage ! I think many travelers will be happy to read about this one. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) now allows you to lock your checked baggage with Travel Sentry(tm) Certified locks.  Something to keep in mind if you haven't eaten yet or if you're in the Evansville, Indiana area:   Brain Sandwiches  still on some menus even after the mad cow scare. Click here if you'd like to read the story, but I think my first reaction is: Huh? Brain sandwiches? And I thought boudin was tough to stomach.
