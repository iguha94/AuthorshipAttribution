Last night, some girls from work & I went to eat at Noche for Restaurant Week. [Sidenote: Restaurant Week is a week (or in this case, 2 weeks) when many of NYC's top restaurants offer fantastic meals for a low price. Since it is now 2004, the lunch price is $20.04. Last year (2003), the price was $20.03.]  So, we go to Noche and have a lovely time. The food was OK; nothing to write home about. The place itself was spectacular and the service was fantastic! Pretty good time. Then, 3 of us (Abigail, Olivia & me) went to a farewell party for another co-worker at a bar/restaurant called Eamon's on 45th Street. Cozy little spot - very nice. I did a shot jagermeister, which I haven't done since about my senior year in high school. It tastes as awful as I can remember. Funny, when I took the shot, I remembered sitting around the kitchen table at Allison O'Con's in Natchitoches with a few other girls. We were all standing around taking turns taking shots of jagermeister before we went out for the night. I can remember riding in Allison's car, but I cannot for the life of me remember where we went that night. Oh, well, I guess. Couldn't have been too many places - it being Natchitoches and all.  Otherwise, not too much happening. Chris is making his famous Open N-train Sandwiches that totally rock! 2 sandwiches: 1 ham and the other roast beef. Spicy brown mustard, mozzerella cheese, Swiss cheese, plum tomatoes. Baked open face until all the cheese melts. FANTASTIC!! Ok, gotta go eat!!
