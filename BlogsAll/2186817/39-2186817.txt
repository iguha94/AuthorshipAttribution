Itâ€™s another beautiful December day! Olivia, who I work with, baked a cartload of sweets and brought half of it to the office. She even placed them in individual cellophane wrappers. And everything is wonderful! But she says that sheâ€™s done with her baking until Valentineâ€™s Day. She made brownies, biscotti, cookies, candies . . . Amazing!!  â€œThe Simple Life,â€ an MTV reality show featuring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie is set to debut tonight. The show is about these 2 rich and somewhat spoiled girls being dropped in the middle of rural Arkansas to live with a family. In the beginning, I donâ€™t think the girls are told exactly what their living conditions will be. I think itâ€™ll be fun to watch them adjust and to see some of their reactions to being asked to pluck a chicken or â€œcheckingâ€ the cows. I know most people know what this means, but if not, it involves one of your arms, a long plastic sleeve to slip your arm into, and a cowâ€™s rectum. Good times!  And for all the men in our lives: DaimlerChrysler's Dodge unit is sponsoring a pay-per-view "Lingerie Bowl" during halftime of the Super Bowl on Feb. 1 featuring models dressed in lingerie playing a seven-on-seven tackle football game. The show will cost viewers $30. The teams will be coached by former NFL stars Lawrence Taylor and Eric Dickerson. (courtesy CNN.com)  P.S. ITâ€™S SNOWING AGAIN!!!!
