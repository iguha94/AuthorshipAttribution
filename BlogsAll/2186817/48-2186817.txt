18 degrees this morning. 18. Oh, and then there's the wind, which drops the temp down to like 9 degrees. 25 for the high today. Otherwise, not that bad of a day. Yesterday was Chris's first day back to work since he resigned from The Westin. The Mandarin Oriental (his new job) gave him 2 days off paid as a Christmas present, which he took this past Sunday and Monday. He has one more day coming as his New Year's gift, which he'll take sometime next week. While it is nice having him home, he's a loud person. Please don't feel like I'm talking behind his back. I've already told him all of this to his face and he agrees that he likes to make plenty of noise. He even whispers loudly.   Now onto the subject of Berg. Berg has a reputation among our friends here in NYC and he was quite the legend in Monroe as well. (We used to have people drop by who had never come by before and the first thing they wanted to do was meet Berg because they'd heard all about him.) If you'd like to see a picture of him, click on the Galleries 1&2 link on the left. He's 15 pounds of pure evil with claws and teeth. He's very protective of the front hallway for some reason and hates the guys who deliver our groceries. He won't let Amanda and me play a decent game of gin rummy due to his desire to lie down on our cards just as the game gets underway. When Olivia stays over, she's scared to go to the bathroom during the night. Anyway, for the last few nights he has woken me up by scratching on our mattress or playing with a shopping bag. I now keep the water bottle next to me at night and my aim has gotten better with my left hand.  Not too much happening the news world today. Hugh Heffner wants Britney Spears in Playboy. Not that that is really news to me. Every guy in the US wants to see Britney in Playboy. I'm sure that would be the hottest selling issue ever.
