I'm not sure if anyone caught the Nick & Jessica Variety Show on Sunday night, but I did. I think the thing that drew me in was that I missed out on the heydays of variety shows. I was too young. So I watched with baited breath and I laughed at times and other times I realized it was all a little corny. But now that I've seen the first show, I'm wondering what they'll do different for the next show. Since it comes on Sunday nights, I'm sure I'll be watching it again due to the lack of quality programming offered during that timeslot. If you haven't watched it, check it out and let me know what you think. I read an article on MSNBC.com this morning that said the show was the highest rated during that timeslot Sunday night. Should be interesting to see if they can pull it off again.  Anyway, Chris & I went to Bed Bath & Beyond after I got off work today.  Bought us: a halogen lamp (all brushed steel like), a fogless shower mirror so we can stare at ourselves at random, 3 ice cube trays, a can opener that cuts the can so there are no sharp edges (of course), and some hangers for my skirts (cause I can't wear pants to work).  At just under $150 later, we took a cab home.  The cabbie had such horrible body odor that I almost choked.  Which reminds me, this guy sat next to me on the train this morning and he smelled like vinegar and eggs.  N-A-S-T-Y!  Nasty!!
