Sorry for the absence in blogging as of late. No excuses really - just being lazy. Chris offered to do the dishes tonight so that leaves me wonder what it is exactly that he wants out of this. Oops! Now he's singing The Bee Gees' Staying Alive. In a really high pitched voice. And I think he's dancing in there. If only you could witness this event!  I have a FANTASTIC list of links to dole out to you but, unfortunately, I must go assist with dinner tonight: lemon chicken, rice, and broccoli.  Since I hear that my father-in-law (we'll call him Fred) is feeling down today all the way down in Lake Charles, La, I'm adding this link especially for him and because I know we need to see one more parody of the Janet/Justin Super Bowl Showstopper! Click   here . Ok, the real link I wanted to include for him is   here . Caution - contains nudity. Oh! And because I know he's probably pretty bored sitting in his hotel room, click here to play a small   game . Chris says it's addictive and since I had to physically remove him from the computer because of this game, I'll agree. I nearly forgot - just in case anyone has been left wondering, the advanced   Donald Rumsfield fighting techniques  are here! OK, OK, I have to go help make dinner. The rest of the list will come soon! I promise!  And last but not least (by far!) - Shout out to my 1-year-old nephew (as of yesterday) IAN!! Happy Birthday playa!
