Chris and I watched Cold Mountain last night. All in all, a good movie. Neither of us like the ending and I think he cursed it the entire walk home. For some reason, I'm just not a big fan of Nicole Kidman. I think she's a very talented actress, hence all the awards, but she just irks me. Can't explain it. Maybe she's just too perfect or something. There was a girl that I graduated with who was the same way. Damn all you perfect people.  Chris has been playing his new video game Prince of Persia. It is by far the most awesome video game I've seen yet. You can control time and run up walls. Amazing graphics! Though he did have to break down and get the game guide because he got stuck. This game is so full of puzzles and riddles. Kickass game!  Well, it appears that Britney Spears has tied the knot: Pop star   Britney Spears  marched down the aisle in Las Vegas on Saturday, marrying a childhood friend from Louisiana, according to news reports. (courtesy AP news)  A friend of mine sent me this website for some unique greeting cards, Sugarqube. While it costs about $10 for a year subscription, it's free to sample them all. So check it out by clicking   here .  OK, it's time to wake up Chris so we can go do 2 weeks worth of laundry. Luckily, the Sugar Bowl game doesn't happen until 8 pm local time so I won't miss out on any of the action. GO TIGERS!!
