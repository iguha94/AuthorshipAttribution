Well, my sister came and went. She flew in Sunday evening and left this morning. I spent the last 2 nights with her at her hotel near Wall Street and it's kind of strange to stay in a hotel in the same town where you live. As a matter of fact, I haven't even been home since Sunday so I'm seriously looking forward to going home, putting on my pj's and sitting my ass in front of the computer to catch up on everything I've missed. However, I'm pretty sure there are still dishes left over from Sunday night's dinner waiting for me to wash. My work is never done.  Since I wasn't home Monday to blog, I need to get this off my chest:  HAPPY (belated) BIRTHDAY MOM!!  Monday was her 53rd birthday and she ended up working late. Just what she wanted, I'm sure. I did call her on her birthday, but I also like to announce this sort of thing to my entire of audience of 2 people, so there you go.  I can't help but comment on the   $1000 omelet . That's right, I said   $1000 OMELET . You can find this little treasure consisting of eggs, lobster, 10 ounces of caviar, and a few trimmings at Norma's restaurant in Le Parker Meridien hotel on West 57th Street. But if you'd rather just read all about it,   click here . I hear that only 1 person has ordered it so far: a British journalist. I wonder how that looks on his expense account. I'm sure it's a little more than what his daily allowance would cover.    This next article I found is fascinatingly odd . This guy slathered his entire hotel room - tv, bed, towels, doors, carpets, etc. - in about 14 jars of Vaseline. They found him at another hotel covered from head to toe in - you guessed it, Vaseline!! They also found pornographic materials in the trashcan in the first hotel room.  I found this on   Sheila O'Malley's  site and I think it's pretty funny considering I'm not a big Kerry fan.   It's a picture of his daughter in a completely see-thru dress - nipples, underwear and not much else.
