Not much going on today since it's the most dreaded day of the year for every single person on the planet. I'm not single, but Chris and I have both expressed our distaste for this "holiday" over dinner and a movie last night. By the way, 50 First Dates was pretty damn funny! I recommend. Ok, so off to the weird links I found this morning.  This one is just strange, gross and there's really no other explanation for it since I have no idea what's going on - all in Japanese or something. Very strange. Click   here .  Ever wondered what it would be like to pop a water balloon in space? I know you have. I sometimes can't sleep at night without trying to figure out just what would happen. Well, you can now rest easy because it's finally   here !  Want a hoodie with the name of your neighborhood on it? Then click   here .  Cute stuff.  Want to see an animated   girl pee standing up ? Yep, very strange indeed. Thank you Magic Cone. I will not be buying this one.  OK, this is something you just have to see! Trust me, you won't be disappointed! Click   here !  And next, a pretty damn funny   Nutrigrain  commercial. At the end, you'll feel GREAT!  And finally, a   weird and twisted animated movie . It's what every Valentine's Day needs.  So on this special day, Rock Hard & Love Long!
