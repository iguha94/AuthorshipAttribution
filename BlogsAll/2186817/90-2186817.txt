I would say "sorry" for the lack of posts, but I've had a damn good time with my guests since they got here on Thursday.  Now our apartment is entirely too quiet so Chris has decided to run his power tools to help mask the void.  Ruthie (Chris's mom), Cacky (his sister), and Savannah (Cacky's youngest at 16 months) came in on Thursday afternoon.  Once they got here, we visited a bit and made dinner.  Then we had us a little ceremony of sorts.  When Chris's grandmother passed away, they divided her belongings amongst the children.  In the end, they had some of her jewelry that they turned into rings for the granddaughters - and I got one, too.  Mine is a ruby that came from a 40-Anniversary wedding gift that her husband gave her.  It's so pretty and I'm very touched that I was included cause one day, I hope to have a little girl to pass along the ring.  I love sentimental gifts.  They mean more than any expensive gift in some bright shiny store.  Chris also received his granddaddy's walking cane and some of his watches.  During their stay, we hit Chinatown up to Prince Street, Columbus Circle, Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Central Park (picnic), Rockefeller Center/Midtown area, Jeckyl & Hyde Club, City Lobster & Crab Company, The Brooklyn Diner, Ricky's (adult store - and yes, purchases were made but those stories shall be told another time), The Upright Citizens Brigade, and shopping, shopping, shopping & shopping!!!  They left the apartment at 4:15 this morning.  I miss them already, but Berg is really upset he doesn't have his choice of luggage to lay on and roll around.  He's currently taking out his aggression on one of my chairs.  The bastard.  By the way, I will be changing the layout soon to something that everyone can read.  Ok, I have to go watch the end of Fear Factor - they had to do some pretty disgusting stuff on Day Two.
