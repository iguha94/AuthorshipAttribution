Well, the Met was great!  If you're ever in NYC, it's a must see - even before the American History Museum, which is usually packed to capacity.  The Met was easier to get into (shorter lines) and they have a coat check.  Very nice!  Chris & I spent 3 hours there and only saw part of the 1st floor and a very small part of the 2nd floor.  But one of the places we saw on the 2nd floor was just row after row of objects behind glass.  There was virtually no one else up there and it almost felt like we weren't supposed to be there.  Like we discovered some secret part of the museum.  It was absolutely fantastic - and this from someone who's not a big "art" fan, but it certainly wasn't just paintings.  There was so much more!  Anyway, more on that later.  I'm sill downloading pictures and I hope to post some to one of the picture galleries.  Of course since everything was pretty much behind glass, you'll see our reflections in a few of them.  Oh!  And it was cool in the American Wing portion because they had these rooms that you could walk through that were set up just like those that would be typical of Virginia or Massachusetts or Maine in the late 1800's.  Gorgeous!!  Ok, enough!  Cause here are your links!!!  I know you're smiling and that makes me happy!  So, here you go:  This is just a strange story - almost sci-fi like:   Woman Grows Extra Breasts .  And not in a good way either!  And now,   The Rainbow Plucking Orgy .  This was a children's cartoon that was broadcast in the 70's and 80's.  I think it has a completely different connotation now and certainly wouldn't have made it on air.  It's hard to keep a straight face watching it.  OK, that's all for now.  I need to go do laundry.  More later.
