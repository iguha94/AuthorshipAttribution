December 1st â€“ what a lovely day! Well, kind of. It started off sunny and bright and then turned strangely overcast and gray. Now it is just cloudy and looks like it might rain later.  Ideally, itâ€™s time to do some holiday shopping but it looks like Iâ€™ll have to wait until when (or if) I receive a holiday bonus. And if it happens like last year, that means that Iâ€™ll have a whopping 2 days to shop before I have to stuff it all in my luggage and hop on the plane bound for the South. I think Iâ€™m up to the challenge as long as Iâ€™m not sick during those 2 days. I recall a mere 2 years ago when I received my holiday bonus. As soon as I got off work, I hopped on a downtown train and picked up my wedding dress & tiara from the shop. I remember carrying it back onto the train and getting somewhat strange looks. I guess most people would have taken a taxi home that day, but what can I say? I was broke â€“ Iâ€™d just spent every last penny I had on that dress. I think itâ€™s balled up in some room at Momâ€™s house now. And since the wedding is now just a memory, Iâ€™ve decided on a new use for my tiara: I will wear it on each birthday from here on out (once I get it back from Mom & Dadâ€™s house). If only I had it today . . .  Ok, not much happening in the news, but I pulled this from the web word for word, so donâ€™t go charging me with plagerism: A particularly curious statement by U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeldâ€™s at a press briefing won him an unexpected honor on Monday. Rumsfeld, usually renowned for his uncompromising tough talking, was awarded the â€œFoot in Mouthâ€ award for a baffling message which probably left his audience in the dark, Britainâ€™s Plain English Campaign said. â€œReports that say something hasnâ€™t happened are interesting to me, because as we know, there are known unknowns; there things we know we know,â€ Rumsfeld told the briefing. â€œWe also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns â€” the ones we donâ€™t know we donâ€™t know.â€ (courtesy MSNBC.com)
