Hey big donna!!! It's Thanksgiving again. And what are we gonna do this year? That's my big question.  The concert was so f*ck@ng awesome. We got to meet all three bands. After the first band got off stage we went to talk to them and me and Roni were talking to the bassist and the lead singer and then Trevor and Jacob walked off. Roni and I, not wanting to be rude and just walk off too, stood there and talk to them for a few minutes, until Trevor and Jacob came back and told them not to take their girls from them. So, that's pretty exciting, we got hit on by two band guys, hot ones too! I'll have to show yo the pictures as soon as I can figure out how to get them on the computer. But the bad thing was the ride home. Soooo close to Natchitoches and that poo-nanny of a trooper had to make his quota. It's gonna cost me $162, but I think I figured out a way for it not to show up on my insurance. I shouldn't own a car. I don't know what's wrong with me. Everytime I try to be the bestest driver, something stupid always happens. (cough*cough*LOSER*cough*cough)  Mom's cooking stew for us for lunch. I'll eat two bowls, one for me and one for you! Christmas is coming up so fast! I can't wait for everyone to be home. We should definately take some pictures. Well, its time for you to work, young lady, and it's time for me to pretend to work. Tell Chris to take it easy big pimp and I'll see you oh so soon!!!!!  Love you,  Becca
