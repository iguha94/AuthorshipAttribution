Not much happening in my world right now. I was supposed to go out to dinner with Chris at this place called   Water's Edge , which is here in Astoria but it has a fantastic view of Manhattan. So I'd heard loads about it, right? Right. So last week, I call up and get reservations for tonight at 7 pm (it being Restaurant Week and everything). All set - everything's a go. Then, we were to go to   Copacabana  for a party for one of Chris's co-workers. Well, without getting into too much detail (because frankly, I'm a bit tired today), dinner is cancelled and Chris is now partying at   Copacabana  with his buddies. It was all a time issue really since Chris's friends started partying at around 4 pm. Since I had to work until 5 pm and then go home, change clothes and try to find the place by myself . . uh, . . . don't think so kid. From what I read online, the place has quite the line on Tuesday nights not to mention velvet ropes. Sorry, but I find velvet ropes to be intimidating.  Well, for anyone else who has had a long day, perhaps you'll enjoy this little diddy:   Online Orgasmic Simulation . Interestingly enough, there is no nudity associated with this link but not something you want to try to expain to little Johnny sneaking a peek over your shoulder. Enjoy my little ones. Enjoy.  Well, since not much else is going on, I'll end this by sending out a big HAPPY BIRTHDAY to   Natalie ! I'm just a fan of her site. Pretty damn kickass, my friends. Kickass.   Natalie , I hope you party like a rockstar for at least 1 night!
