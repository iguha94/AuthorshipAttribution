So far, today has been a good day. Itâ€™s butt-ass cold outside, but whatâ€™s new? Chris doesnâ€™t have to work tomorrow and Iâ€™m looking forward to his alarm not going off at 4:15 am. On Saturday, weâ€™ll be helping his friend, Sergio, move from Brooklyn to the apartment directly above ours. Should be an interesting arrangement as long as I donâ€™t hear any strange sounds from above.  OK, so Iâ€™ve watched Foxâ€™s â€œThe Simple Lifeâ€ starring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie for the last 2 nights. I think my jaw hit the ground after last nightâ€™s episode. Their host family secured them jobs at a dairy farm. Now, this is their very first job in their entire lives and theyâ€™re going to work on a farm. I knew things would go wrong when they showed up an hour late and Paris carried her Louis Vuitton bag with her to milk the cows. At the end of their workday, they were supposed to fill all of these bottles with milk and seal them for the delivery truck that was on its way. After the owner walked away to tend to other matter, they proceeded to hide half of the empty bottles they were to fill and then they: spilled about half of the milk, added water to some bottles, got dirt in a few, etc. They then disappeared into the dairy farm ownerâ€™s home to sleep on his couch. Once he found them, he gently said that he would do better by himself, paid them each $42 for what little they worked and wished them the best in life. I have to hand it to the dairy farm owner because I would have cussed them to no end and then kicked them in their pampered asses. I must say that I thought they would have done better as far as jobs go. Next weekâ€™s episode has them working at Sonic where they proceed to put up naughty words on the marquee and then flip off passers by while wearing Sonic food costumes. Weâ€™ll see what happens next week.  Iâ€™ve also been watching MTVâ€™s â€œRich Girlsâ€ starring Ally Hilfiger and Jamie Gliecher which, at times, can be just as jaw dropping when you see all of the things they do or canâ€™t do. For instance, if Iâ€™m not mistaken, Jamie has someone do her makeup every morning. On the episode I watched last night, Ally was whining and crying to her dad about her childhood and then because she wants to be able to stand on her own 2 feet without her parents help. She then goes grocery shopping for ingredients to make nachos, but has to ask various people in the store what goes on them or what type of cheese to use. I must say that one thing Iâ€™ve noticed about these Ã¼ber rich people is that they lie around and nap a lot!  In todayâ€™s paper: Five high school students pleaded not guilty yesterday to robbery charges stemming from a monthlong crime spree in which they posed first as female prostitutes and then undercover cops, to rip people off.
