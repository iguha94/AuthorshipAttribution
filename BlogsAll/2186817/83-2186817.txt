I love Thursdays!  And even though it's payday, I'm still broke since my rent money comes out of this paycheck.  And to top it all off, I opened up our rent invoice and our monthly rent went up by $98.  No notice or anything which pretty much sucks.  Rent nearly kills me & I hear they may raise subway fares!  They're bleeding us dry!  NYC had a budget surplus of like $4 million at least - you'd think they would help the straphangers out since they raised fares not even a year ago!  Ahhh!  Geez!!  Assholes!  Whew!  I'm glad I got that off my chest!  Berg is being evil as usual.  He's scratching on the chair, the movies on the shelf, the couch, the front door, the closet door, the mattress - everywhere except one of his two scratching posts.  Go figure.  Chris & Sergio are going out tonight to The Whiskey Bar.  Chris hasn't been in a couple of weeks.  It was time.  I've been telling Chris that he needs to go to the doctor for his chronic indigestion.  He has stubbornly refused.  As a matter of fact, we just went back and forth with me trying to get him to go and him saying, "I don't want to go because of needles.  If they can do something without needles, I'll definitely go."  At this point, I assured him that there's a really good chance they won't have to draw blood or anything, but since I didn't say "100% sure," that's not really good enough for him.  I was turned down.  He's stubborn and hard-headed for sure.
