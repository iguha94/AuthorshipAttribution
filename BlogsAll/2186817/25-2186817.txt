Drama. Not too much drama, but enough to hurt your stomach a little; thatâ€™s how my weekend ended and my week started. If I could, I would wave a magic wand and all would be right & good in the world. As it is, I can only sit on my hands, make phone calls (wait for them to call me back) and pray that all will be OK in the end. Even though Iâ€™ve been calling to try to help, I think Iâ€™m just adding to the stress of the situation. I hate being so far away during these tough times. If only I were rich enough to take off for about a month to help out. Perhaps in my next life . . . And yet I feel so helpless even though I know thereâ€™s pretty much nothing I can do from here. Iâ€™m frustrated, very, very frustrated.  On a livelier front, Cacky will be coming in this Friday for her birthday weekend in NYC! We have a few activities planned, but nothing too major as Chris will have to go to work early Sunday morning (7 am). We have plans to go out to dinner, an Irish pub, shopping and, of course, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater. Everything else is pretty much up in the air.  I would write more, but Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m a bit preoccupied and canâ€™t seem to grab hold of a complete thought, so letâ€™s just make comments on todayâ€™s news! Iâ€™m sure by now everyone has heard about the California lawyer who was shot at point blank like 5 times. Amazing video! Talk about a disgruntled client! On Sunday, I watched Sean â€œP Diddyâ€ Combs run the NYC marathon. He ended up raising over $2 million for NYC schools so I canâ€™t really shoot down his efforts as just another publicity stunt. In truth, I like P Diddy â€“ his music and most other of his business ventures. He seems like a stand up guy anyway. And in case you havenâ€™t heard, Minnie Driver (the actress) is planning to work in a Cambodian sweatshop in order to help improve working conditions and pay for people in poor countries. Sheâ€™s planning to bring a photographer along and theyâ€™re hoping to make a documentary or write a book about the ordeal. OK, so now I have to question whether sheâ€™s doing this for poor people or poor Minnie.  In case anyone would like more blogs to read, there is one (www.bigwhiteguy.com) in which this Canadian white male who is now living in Hong Kong recounts his adventures of living in a city where the â€œtax rate is unbeatableâ€ and he sees â€œthings most people on dream of seeing.â€ This site was featured on CNN and is good to read in case you just donâ€™t have enough to fill your day. Yes, I say live vicariously through the Big White Guy!! Why not? Itâ€™s cheaper than going there yourself! Ok, now off to order Chinese food from Chef Ho Dumpling House!!
