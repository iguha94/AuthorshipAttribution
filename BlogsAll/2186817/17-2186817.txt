Busy, busy again today. Laurren is back from California! I got her some Gerber daisies and made a sign that said â€œWelcome Back Laurren,â€ which I colored with crayons yesterday evening while I was watching JFK. Iâ€™m kind of glad that I watched that movie when I did because today Iâ€™m watching the Today Show on NBC and they interviewed Lee Harvey Oswaldâ€™s brother. Canâ€™t remember exactly what year JFK was assassinated, but itâ€™s getting closer to the anniversary (40 years, I think) so, of course, theyâ€™re re-hashing everything. Good movie if you like that sort of thing. I do. Anyway, the weekend went pretty well. On Friday, Chris and I went out to eat at Uno Pizzeria and then watched Matrix Revolutions. Both excellent! We brought our new camcorder along to play with so that we could learn how to use it. On Saturday, we went to Best Buy in Queens and bought like 5 movies along with a carrying case for the new camcorder. Always much fun at Best Buy, but you canâ€™t stay in there too long or Chris will go nuts! On Sunday while Chris worked, I stayed home and did some light cleaning and that was about it. I rested as much as I could since I figured that today would be pretty busy since I have lots of presentation materials to get out this evening. I may be staying late today . . .  Interesting read on ABCnews.com: a British multimillionaire will hand over his infant to a gorilla for a night of baby-sitting. He says thatâ€™s kind of how he grew up, only odder. Very strange man indeed and Iâ€™ll be surprised if there arenâ€™t any protests, but we can only wait and see. In a story out of Shreveport which I found on CNN.com, it is reported that Southern drawls & accents have thwarted voice recognition systems used to route non-emergency calls. I guess weâ€™re just too complicated for their high-tech systems!!  OK, I must go find something good for lunch today â€“ hopefully something warm instead of just a sandwich or salad. Later kids!
