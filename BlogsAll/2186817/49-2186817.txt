I read a story on MSNBC.com today about a growing trend among teens: getting high from cough medicine, aka Dexing or Robotripping. I don't think this an entirely new concept as I remember it coming into fashion when I graduated from high school in 1996. It is their cough suppressant, dextromethorphan, or DXM, which kids are after. In large doses, DXM can cause hallucinations, heart problems, and a zombie-like state. Sounds like fun, right? Not to mention that wonderful cherry flavor. Unless of course your hardcore and go for the original flavor.  Oh, a little word of advice if you're ever walking around the streets of Manhattan and someone approaches you about your hair. These people are selling packages that are supposed to include services such as: haircut, massaging shampoo, deep conditioning treatment, head massage, facial, etc. The package costs around $60 and then there is an additional $10 service fee that you only pay the 1st time. So, they swipe your credit card right then and there and hand you all of your information. Then you make your appointment with the hair salon and let them know what services you'd like to schedule. Like a dumbass, I did this in March 2003. For all of the "free services" included in my $60 package, it ended up costing me another $150 not including tip. The whole time I was in the salon, these 2 guys were fighting back behind me and had to be pulled apart from each other several times. Since that splendid event, I've been approached another 2 or 3 times. I just look at them and yell, "IT'S A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY AND I'LL NEVER MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN!!" Then I run.
