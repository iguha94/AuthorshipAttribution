My sister sent me this file and I wanted to share it with all, but unfortunately, I can't post it.  Just as well I guess since it had some big, big nudity in it.  I then found a link to it on another website, but they've pulled the file.  Go figure.  Nothing too exciting happening this weekend.  Chris & I went out to eat last night at this place called The Brick Oven here in Astoria.  Very nice & quaint.  It was only a 15 minute walk there and back, which hopefully helped burn off some of that dessert!  Now on Comedy Central's Dave Chappelle's show, they did a skit about Rick James.  For all of you fans out there - CHRIS - here's a little something for you.  You can get your own    I'm Rick James, Bitch!   shirt for a mere $14!  Come on, you know you want one!  And if you have money running out of your ass and your out of fresh ideas for Holloween this year,   click here  and try Riders.  I can't imagine hopping on the subway wearing this.  This past Halloween we squeezed in next to Jesus complete with cross.  It was a tight squeeze, but we managed it.  I think he grazed my ass at one point, but it was Jesus so what was I to do?  Ok, that's all I have for now.  Until later . . .
