Talk to me baby Say something nice Talk to me honey I need your advice  Never mind fortune Never mind fame I don't wear diamonds I don't drink champagne  So, what's that song?  Can you guess it?  Let's see if anyone gets this one right.  Otherwise, I'm sitting here wasting some time.  I need to do laundry tonight, but it was kind of busy at the laudromat when I walked past it on my way home.  So I figure I'll wait until about 6:45 or 7 pm and then give it a shot.  Last night & tonight are free dryer nights so there are always tons of people fighting for dryers.  You only save like $2 to $3 and I would rather pay extra so I don't have to fight others for machines, but we are completely out of towels and my underwear selection is starting to thin out.  Interestingly enough, I was having this same conversation with one of my coworkers and she said that she only does laundry like once a month.  My jaw nearly hit the floor, but she explained that most of their clothes go to the dry cleaner.  Insane!  I wish I only had to do laundry once a month, but then I would hate to see my dry cleaner bill.  Chris is napping on the couch after having a late night.  He only got like 3 hours of sleep before he dragged himself (with my help) out of bed and into the shower.  I've been up since before 5 am, but I don't do naps well.  I usually wake up very cranky & moody and then I just feel like shit.  He also had one too many whiskeys.  I've certainly been there before.  "Dear God, please don't let me throw up.  I promise I won't drink on an empty stomach again."  I'm sure I've heard those words come out of my mouth at least once . . .  Ok, off to do laundry.  Wish me luck!
