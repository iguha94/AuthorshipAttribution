Not much happening in my world today, thus far. Itâ€™s a rainy day here in the Big Apple, but itâ€™s getting brighter outside. If you have access to BBC America (the TV station) and you like shows like Trading Spaces, then you should watch Homefront in the Garden on Wednesdays. Youâ€™ll have to check your local listings, but it comes on at 8 pm here. They donâ€™t just re-do your typical garden. What they do is amazing and somewhat mind-blowing. Itâ€™s only a 30-minute show so itâ€™s quick to see results. I watched the Victoriaâ€™s Secret Fashion Show last night on TV. I love lingerie, so I had to watch. They had some very interesting pieces showcased. If only my closet was big enough . . .   Thereâ€™s a story out on the web about a guy in Ohio who is in jail on forgery charges. He struck a deal for them to table his transfer from a local jail to a state prison all so that he could watch a football game on TV over the weekend. The place where heâ€™s going doesnâ€™t have TV for inmates. Interesting fact courtesy of NYTIMES.com: Berlin is the world's first major city to switch from analog to entirely digital television broadcasting. The transition went almost unnoticed in Germany or elsewhere, which is remarkable, given that in the United States, the same process has been bogged down by politics.  On a poll on CNN.com this morning, the question was raised â€œAre you shocked by the charges against Michael Jackson?â€ Not surprisingly, 93% werenâ€™t shocked. Go figure.  Thatâ€™s really all for today. Iâ€™m going home for Christmas one month from today. I donâ€™t like leaving Chris alone during Christmas, but I canâ€™t pass up a free trip home either. I can justify my guilt by reminding myself that heâ€™ll be working the entire time anyway. Itâ€™s a good thing Mom & Dad have a new calling plan that allows them to call nationwide for no extra charge. Hope theyâ€™re not surprised when they get their bill and find that I called Chris at 3 am local time every morning to wake him up. Oh! And Iâ€™m working on filling out my insurance forms for re-enrollment for next year. Pain in the ass, let me tell ya!! Well, itâ€™s getting closer to lunch time - time to post. I think Dawn & I will be heading to Au Bon Pain today. She wants a salad and I think Iâ€™m going to get a tuna sandwich. Iâ€™ve had soup at least 3 times this week. Iâ€™m tired of soup. Watch me end up getting soup.
