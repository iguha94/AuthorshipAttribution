Turns out the whole Kansas City area that has Comcast cable  internet was having problems. I was on hold for 40 minutes this morning to figure out what was wrong with my internet and the guy was like "What area do you live in?" and I'm like "Kansas City" and he's like "Oh they're having temporary problems and should be back up soon." All that holding for nothing! Grrrrr!  Hey Sally, to post you you have to push rhe "post and publish" button for it to show up on the page. If it shows up in the section below where you typed don't worry it will eventually post when someone else makes a post and pushes the "post and publish" button. OR you can always click "edit" that is right below your post at blogger and it'll show up back in the section where you type and just push the "post and publish" button. I hope that made sense. Sally I'll go ahead and make your linke clickable. If you or anyone ever want to make a link clickable here's how you do it type all this out in blogger exactly the way it is. Don't put any extra spaces or delete any spaces.  &lt;a href=http://www.link-you-want-to-go-to.com target=_blank&gt;Put whatever text you want here or type the link again&lt;/a&gt   Guys I have come to the conclusion that I do indeeed have a Rick 6th sense. LOL See I woke up this morning at like 6:40 and I swear not but 2 minutes after I woke up "Fox & Friends" had Mancow on. He's that radio DJ guy. And he was talking to Steve, E.D., and Brian on the camera and then he starts waving for someone to come over to join. Guess who it was RICK! I about flipped my lid, he looked geourgeous. I got like 2 pictures 'cause he was there for like 1 minute tops, but the pics aren't good 'cause my stupid flash on my camera wouldn't turn off when I kept trying to turn it off. I also had a very strange, but semi good and semi bad dream about Rick last night. I'll share it later, but for know I"ve got to go to school.
