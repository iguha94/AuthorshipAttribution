I am glad to know I am not the only one who thinks they should stop with all this Laci Peterson stuff.  I am so sorry for her family and for her going though God knows what.  I think Scott did it but I don't need to know every detail, everyday.  To the discussion about Religion classes in college, I took History of Christanity that was taught by an athiest.  Now that was interesting.  I am Baptist and have been all my life, but it is more important, I think, to be a Christian.  Religions are man-made. anyway, I digress....I have never looked at Jesus as an historical person only.  It was weird but at the same time, this class really made you think.  I think that is one of the most wonderful things about college....you are on your own and your figure out what you think about things and why you think about them the way you do.  I loved my college years.  Now, let's see, Rick.....and Greg.....throw in Shep for a threesome....YEA :) :)  {bag girl Lynne} hehehe  Seriously, does anyone know how tall they are?  Rick, Greg, and Shep?  I know what I dream but I would like it to be accurate.....as far as height is concerned.  You all thought I was going to say something else didn't you?  (Good Girls, we are all rubbing off on one another)  I don't know how much I am going to be able to log on for the next several days.  Megan turned 3 today and her party is Saturday.  Here in Richmond, VA, it has done nothing but rain for the last 2 weeks.  Plan "b" for all the kids to play inside :(  more work for Lynne - just what she needs.  Oh, Natalie, I took her today for her checkup, we are going to try singulair for her allergies,  the zyrtec wasn't doing anything and she is such a zommbie on benedryl.  Have a good evening Ladies.
