Morning Ladies! I'm home today, and I feel like crap. ick! It's storming pretty bad again today, but no torado warnings, so I'm cool. :) One of my dogs is terrified of the thunder, she's attached like glue to my leg. I was supposed to go to a "save the buzz" rally this morning for our local radio station (96.5 the buzz) but with it storming so bad and me feeling like crap I didn't go. I guess it's fine and the station isn't getting canned after all. That reminds me I'm gonna go check dc101.com to see if they have the interviews up real quick. -- Ok, they must be re-vamping the site or something, because I'm having problems accessing certain pages. Oh well, that hopefully means the interviews will be up soon. :)   Natalie, if you've seen the first two HP movies, you could probably get away with starting with book 3, though in the book there's some extra characters, but I wouldn't take you too long to get used to them. J.K. Rowling keeps saying book 2 is much more significant that we all know, so I think I'm going to re-read that so I can try to pick up on some clues, but I think I may have a small idea what's going on. I really like the books just because she writes with simplicity, obviously because the book is for kids. It's not like trying to read Lord of the Rings, where everything is much more detailed, down the the last speck on a leaf LOL.   I hope everyone is having a good morning and I'll talk to y'all later. :)
