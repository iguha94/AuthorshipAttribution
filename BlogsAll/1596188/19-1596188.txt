Thanks Ellen SO VERY MUCH for that site! As I kept reading I kept thinking "That's me! I feel those things! I do that!" I have never felt so strongly about something as I do photography. In fact tonight on my way home from the movie (it was awesome!) The sky was filled with lightning. It was the strangest thing, it was only lightning no thunder, no rain. Anyway the lightning was flooding the sky. I mean if you've ever been to a concert where tons of flashes are going off at once, it was like that. It was SO beautiful! And all I could think was, "Damn I left my camera at home!" (I normally carry my digital camera in my purse) So when I got home I grabbed my camera and rushed outside and took photos for about 1/2 an hour. I only got about 3 decent lightning photos, but that's rare considering lightning is there and gone in a split second.  ......ummm hold on my cat is crying bloody muder, it's raining now and she must've come outside when I went out to shoot my photos LOL!..........  Anyway I'll never forget the first time I woke up in the morning and was like "I want to take photos today!" and every day after then I feel just the same. I don't always get to take photos every day, but I would love to. I just.......I dunno words can't describe how I feel about it. It's my passion! I've never had a passion before. =) Ok, sorry for rambling I just get all in a tizzy when I talk about photography, it's similar to my "Rick Fix" high, only better. LOL
