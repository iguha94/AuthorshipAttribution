Wow! This is my first time back in days, and everything's changed! Toto! We're not in Kansas anymore!  First things, first.  Hallelujah! Jen you're back and you're okay!  I've been doing the Slim-Fast thing twice a day and eating a *%#@ sensible dinner. I toast you with the first sip everytime. Had a salad for dinner the other night and actually felt guilty. I'm truly sorry about the food ads. They really bothered me when I was pregnant, but for quite a different reason.  The teens are all gone and it's just the baby girls and me for a week! Roy's coming home Thurs. night (our 10th anniversary) and the grandparents are watching the girls for us ALL Friday (day and night).  I've got a concierge room at the Ambassador Hotel in Amarillo and reservations for dinner, which we may or may not make.  I hate not being able to see the postings as I post. My short term memory is embarrassingly short.   To the one celebrating her last day of work - Congratulations! Many happy, lazy summer days of nothing but FOX News.  To the one(s) who got their pictures - Congratulations!  To the one(s) who didn't - My sincere condolences. But good things come to those who wait. And wait. And wait. Maybe he's waiting for some "special" pictures to be developed, something with an unbuttoned white cotton shirt, 501s with the top button(s) unbuttoned..... Hey wait a minute, I'm a ShepHerder. I can't be thinking things like this about your guy. Many apologies.  To Melissa - keep this blog for us and have a message board for the unwashed masses. And thanks for asking our opinions when it's all of your hard work that's making it possible.  Well, that's about all I can remember; found a great recipe for stuffed manicotti that we're going to try tonight. Jen - it's just stuffed with Gerber Creamed Spinach, okay? Later.
