YAY Teri! LOL he knows he has a cult following! He's probably staring at the computer going "These girls are crazy, and I have to e-mail them back. God help me." LOL See, you know it was him 'cause no one could fake that sense of humor he's got. =)  Someone asked if I get to watch tv at work. Well sort of. My mom has a tv in her office and my office is right next to hers and we have a little window and doorway in between our offices. My mom works 4 ten hour days a week instead of 5 eight hour days, and I have to work on her day off, so I use her computer and get to have free reign of the tv on that day. Then once in a blue moon I can talk my mom into watching Studio B instead of Marth Stewart. Also I get one day off a week because I work part time. Today is my day off so I've kept tuning in to Fox News to see if Rick is on. They've been talking about this Laci Peterson stuff all morning so I'll flip back and forth between Fox and something else. I don't think I've missed any Rick especially since no one else has claimed to see him this morning.   Wow Shep was just talking about how he's coverd stanic cult cases and that strangling a baby is not what they do, and the way he was talking about it was just -- I dunno he had a passion in his voice. Don't think that's quite the term I'm looking for, but basically it seems to me that he knows a satanic cult does gruesome horrible things to babies and just how horrible it is. I'm sure he's pretty biased against Scott Peterson considering he covered the OJ case. But you know right now there's no doubt in my mind that Scott did it. I may not know all the facts, but considering how shady he's acted, I can't believe that Scott didn't play any role in the murder of his wife.
