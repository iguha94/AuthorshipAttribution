Teri - That is awesome.  I know you have been waiting.  I need to sit down and write mine sometime so I can be giddy like the rest of you.  I know what you mean about this winter in Maryland.  I didn't think I would ever dig out but of course now it has been raining for like two months straight.  I'm hoping it clears up this weekend since I"m going to the beach tommorow.  I also saw Jeff Goldblait when I was home at lunch - I think he is a cutie.  Melissa - Your lucky to catch a glimpse at work since during the day is when they always seem to be on.  And of course I always miss it.   I take it there were no Rick sightings today on your day off.  That is the way it always works.  Welcome to the board Ellen!!  I know everyone was talking about the height thing and it is hard to tell.  Shep looks tall to me.  My husband is 6'2" and he looks to be at least that tall.  I think Bill O'Reilly was saying he was like 6'3" or 6'4" so you can kind of compare to him (of course he is always sitting down)  It is kind of hard to tell on TV.  I was thinking RIck and Greg were maybe 6 feet but who knows.  In that picture of Greg and Rick where Rick has his arm around him isn't Rick taller.  I will have to go find the picture and check it out.  Well enough on that.  Leslie - I like your name for Brett Baier.  After you said the Koala Baier I saw him on tv and he does.  Cute and adorable!
