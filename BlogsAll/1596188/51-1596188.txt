Morning ladies! I've been up all night so I'm on like this delusional insomnia high.  "When you have insomnia, nothings real. Everything is far away. Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy." (from Fight Club)   I've been pouring my sweat and tears over making a new layout for my new personal domain and I've still got ZIP. However I *DID* get   www.Rick-Leventhal.com  registered and working! Hopefully I'll be able to build the new site for him soon. =) Lemme ask you this, would you all rather have a blog, or something more along the lines of a message board on the new site? Let me know, so I can set it up.  Well I'm hungry, so I think I'll go eat some breakfast, and then I'm going to Barnes and Noble later on, hopefully I won't buy too much.   Jan and Nat I hope you are surprised with a nice gift in you mailboxes on Monday! :)  Oh, and whoever said their co-worker was sleeping under the desk.....OMG I just can't believe it! I mean sure there's probably been a time when we've all though it, but never in my wildest dreams did I think someone would actually do it. The worst I've done is pretend to be looking for something I *dropped* under my desk when I can no longer hold back tears of frustration. Wow, it's kind of funny though. You should've got a picture, it would have been hilarious! Hope she gets fired, I mean crap if you're THAT tired, call in sick. Well talk to you all later.
