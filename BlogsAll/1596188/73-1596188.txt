I am so mad right now.  I just typed a huge blog and lost it.  Ugh.  Now I have to remember what I said.  Well it is another beautiful day on the east coast.  Going to be 96 today, a little too hot but at least it is not raining.  Lynne - Hope you are enjoying the weather in VA.  Denise - Thanks for sharing the concert info.  I'm glad he didn't spew too much.  Of course I'm seeing him right outside DC so he may feel the need to be a little more vocal.  I hope not.  I love their music and can't wait to see them Tuesday.    Jan - I remember LIve Aid.  My mom wouldn't let me watch the whole thing but I watched as much as I could  Nat - We got our VCR in 1985 also and I remember it was a big thing because they were like $500-$700 back then.  I remember getting cable also and I was so excited because I got to see MTV.  Does anyone remember the band The Hooters.  I loved them.  I had a huge crush on the blond singer that played the piano.   Todd was looking good yesterday and yes he still has the goatee.  I was in the other room and heard his voice.  I'm getting very good at recognizing the guys voices.  Melissa - I love early 90's hip hop/dance music.  That is when I was 21 and going to the clubs.  THey had some great music in that time frame.  You go girl reading that whole book.  I'm a fast reader but that is a lot of pages.  Where were you going on your road trip??  My hubby is working on July 4th so we won't be doing anything.    AH  - I saw Greg and was he wearing the same shirt he had on Sunday.  It looked like it and yes I notice these trivial things.  My hubby like British Bands.  He likes The Cure but also like The Damned and Ministry.    Ellen - Good to see you posting.  I bet you do miss California.  Well I gotta get to work, talk to you ladies later.
