Good Evening Ladies!!!  Just finished my last day of work and I just got to see Adam on The Fox Report so I'm very happy now especially since I missed Rick last night.  Jan - Yeah, I'm glad you got your picture.  I need to email him and ask him for one.  I'm mad at myself or not asking in the first email I sent.  Yes send it to Melissa to put up.  I think I know what tie you all are talking about.  It sounds like the one he wore on one of the shows when he came back from Iraq.  It was sad saying goodbye to some people today (not my boss - LOL) but I'm glad I'm gone.  Yes school will probably stress me too.  Nat - I can' believe Rick was in jeans and I missed it.  Damn!!!  I didn't tape thinking it was just a repeat of the story that he did before.  Well I did get to see Adam in jeans and open shirt once and that was really nice.  And you got to see Todd too, now all you need isto get your picture and you will be set.  Melissa - I like the idea of having the blog for us ladies to chat the way we have been.  I know yesterday I said I didn't care but I changed my mind.  Whatever you do is fine.   We just appreciate all your hard work.  Jeff has been on a lot and I think he is yummy too.  LOL  Mike Tobin doesn't do anything for me either so you are not alone.  Good drawing, that is something I always wish I could do but I can barely draw stick figures.   Lynne - Have you been roasting down there in VA.  We actually went a whole week without rain.  It is crazy because now it is so hot you can't stand it but Bill is on the way to give us some more rain.  Jen - Great menu, I got your IM and can't wait to you are back to your old self and ready to chat away.  Leslie - Congrats on our anniversary, sounds like you have a romantic evening planned. I was gone all weekend too and when I got back it took me forever to get through all the posts.    Well gotta go find something to eat for dinner.
