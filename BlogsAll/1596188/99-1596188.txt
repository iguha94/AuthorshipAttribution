Hi Gals---I'm really NOT liking this non-split-screen thingy, I just read the posts, and laughed through most of them, but for the life of me I can't remember a word I just read, except, ironically enough ADD. Does that mean anything??? I think my sister has that, and it's not all bad, if she starts ranting about work or anything that I'm not wanting to listen to, I just point and say "Look, something shiny!" and that pretty much kills the rant. (Just a sarcastic joke, I'm not making fun of people with ADD)  Leslie, Adamaniacs is hilarious! Pure genius my friend. Even though 'technologically challenged' does sound better, it's takes so much longer to type than 'idiot'.....  ....speaking of...I am one Natalie. I have that aol address, but I don't have unlimited time there so I just use my sister's MSN access. I'll sign on one day and re-read your email....I emailed you back, I hope it went through.  Jen I emailed you too. I always liked the phrase 'No Worries' because I've heard Aussies use that, but now that Rick said it to Natalie, it's even cooler.....so Jen, no worries....  Sherry, I emailed you too, I got the package, thanks so much, I'm a little punch-drunk tonight.....but I've had a good evening. Honestly, no alcohol was consumed by me, it's just a Fox induced high...definately NOT Shep-Lite....  I don't remember who posted it, but I remember only about two things from biology and one of them was that baldness is related to your mother's male relatives, I think the other thing had to do with blood type....  I gather from the lack of postings that Rick was absent...I wonder if tomorrow is Shep-Lite again, I like Rick F okay, but his voice just doesn't do it for me.   Ok, I'm gonna post this and re-read, I may be back.....
