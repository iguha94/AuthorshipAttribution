Melissa - I'm perfectly satisfied with a blog, but have no objections to a message board.    Jen - Your menu sounds so, um, tempting.  Lol!  I hope that you make a swift recovery.  Jan - Like you, I can't understand why Fox hasn't made videos available of their war coverage.  It's incomprehensible to me that TPTB would think that no one would be interested in such videos, but perhaps that is their thinking.  The news channels are fiercely competitive, so I can't believe that they aren't aware that CNN is marketing their videos of the war.       My local newspaper ran an article regarding the rap music promos that Fox has been running.  The article mentioned that a man named Richard O'Brien, whose title is senior vice president-creative director, as the person who came up with the rap music promos.  (A country music promo is also being planned for any of you country music fans.)  He is quoted as saying, "A lot of the things that we do at the Fox News Channel are things I know CNN and MSNBC would never do."  To come up with ways to give more exposure to the guys who most interest female viewers is certainly something that CNN and MSNBC COULD never do because they don't even have the kind of personnel that Fox has.   Mr. O'Brien could be an appropriate person to contact for letting Fox know that we want TPTB to come up with more creative use of our favorite reporters.  It may be possible to reach him by using the same type of e-mail address method used to reach Rick and the other Fox reporters who've been successfully contacted.    Like the rest of you, I'm hoping to see Rick next week.  It looks as though Greg may be gone from Israel.  I so wish that Fox would have something special for the Fox embeds in connection with the 4th of July.
