hey guys! Typing a little slow here but made it home in a couple of pieces j.k. I've got *counting* 32 staples *ouch* that are hot and sore -- there was NO fox news inbetween the percocet and morphine drip I was going complety insane they only had CNN and I was telling Melissa of course there had to be a peace treaty that Greg would have covered but I had to watch it on CNN -- I thought I'd let you guys know what filled me for today:  2 tsb of applesauce for breakfast  1 cheddar cheese cube and 1/2 saltine cracker for lunch  1 cracker with tuna fish and about 1/2 a tsb of "loose" tuna fish for dinner  I've also been able to drink 16oz of the required 64 oz of liquid I'm suppose to drink a day tomorrow I start my vitamins and protein shakes tomorrow and get these God awful staples out Tuesday -- I got 227 new e-mails since I had my surgery and none from the object of my affection -- it was funny as I was going into the OR they were like "Think of something or someone that makes you happy" dunno why I started laughing and smiling hmm wonder why *eating my crushed procect with baby applesauce* okay done -- talk to you guys later with more surgery "war stories" thank you guys so much for all your well wishes!! They ment so much to me !! :)
