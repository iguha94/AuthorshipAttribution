i don't post much but i read that Nan thought she might be the oldest in here - nada - i  graduated in '70. that makes me 50 and i still have a hard time with it.  i didn't mind turning 30 or 40.  i was living in san diego in my 30's and 40's and loved it.  i just recently moved back to minnesota to be closer to my family.  i miss sunny, warm southern caliornia and i miss being 40!  i just can't find anything too great about being 50... uggh??  but i love this blog even tho i don't post much.  i get a kick out of what you all get talking about while we wait for a rick sighting.  and oh yes, as long as i revealed my age, i might as admit that i'm a democrat - which can make watching fox news annoying at times.  but i like the challenge plus it's about time as cnn and msnbc definitely sway to the left, it's good to have a strong conservative view to listen to.   and they are fair.  enough of that... i forget who likes todd conners [ at 50 my memory started going ? ] but i saw him today and what a cutie and he was dressed casual again, no tie.  i miss seeing rick all roughed up... you kow what i mean... and i miss his hat.  we have a thunder storm going on here, lot's of lightning. i love a rainy night. that's a song isn't it?  =) sorry i don' post to each of you all seperately... for the love of me i don't know how you all remember what you all said to be able to reply like you do.  be that as it is, my memory is shot.  but i am glad that melissa started this blog and you all can be sooo friendly.  let's hope rick doesn't take too long of a vacation this summer.
