Jan - Congrats on Rick's reaction to your poem.  I'll bet he's the only guy on any of the news channels to be so honored by having a poem written for him.  You mentioned his grin.  I love that mischievous grin of his, and have you all noticed that when he smiles, sometimes the corners of his mouth initially lift just a little bit, as if he's anticipating breaking into a full smile?  I'm so anticipating seeing Rick this weekend on Fox.  It looks as if Fox is paying some attention to us Leventhal lovers.  Now just give him a big story so that we can see lots of him.      Fox does have some hot guys, Jewish and otherwise.  You can tell that Fox chooses many of their female reporters with the object of appealing to male viewers.  There's nothing wrong with that.  It's a smart move and all of their female reporters seem to be quite competent.  I don't think that Fox execs have previously considered that male reporters give women more reason to watch Fox in the same way that female reporters give men more incentive to watch.  With the reaction to Rick and to Greg Kelly, their eyes have surely been opened.  We should let Fox know that we also want to see more of the other Fox guys who appeal to us.    Just a word of caution, ladies:  It's thrilling to email Rick and get a reply back from him, but let's not overdo it and make pests of ourselves.  We don't want to ruin a good thing.
