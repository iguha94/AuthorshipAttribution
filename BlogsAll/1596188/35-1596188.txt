Dangit- I lost my post from earlier.  My computer froze up and I had to shut down.  OK- sooooo let's see.    Leslie- Your dinner sounded great, even if it wasn't sensible.  Email him- it couldn't hurt!  (Yeah, I know, this coming from me who has *no* idea of what to say to Todd to get a signed pic).  You're witty enough, I'm sure you could say something that would get him to do it!  Can you also send one to Todd for me.....LOL!  I'm lacking wit lately ;-p  LMAO- you're right- what's up with the tan suit????   Your hubby is such a romantic *sweetie*!  You're a lucky gal!                             ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* GROUP HUG ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  Jen- I think you stole the dream I was supposed to have last night- LMAO!  I thought for sure that I'd dream something *REALLY* good about him, but it didn't happen.  Guess I need to see more of the jeans segment!   Glad you're having good dreams though!  You deserve them! ;-D  I just could not imagine being subjected to all those food ads and *not* screaming in frustration.  I hope the staple removal goes well and that it does bring relief- I would imagine that they must itch like *crazy* too as well as cause some pain.  *DO* let us know how it goes tomorrow!
