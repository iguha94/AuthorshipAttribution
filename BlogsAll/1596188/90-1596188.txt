So, Mr. Smith Goes to Prison....wasn't that a movie or something??? Wouldn't it be nice to be the one to do the frisking...'Up against the wall and spread 'em', I like the sound of that...then you'd get the cuffs out....Only thing better would be if he went on the 'buddy' system with Rick...:-) No Hannity or Skinnerville today...I missed those, I like when Shep interacts with those two...  Our summer went from nice to naughty overnight, yesterday was sunny and warm, perfect for sitting out and reading, but today the humidity started kicking in and will probably be with us forever now..."It's not so much the heat...." Thank God for central air!  A no Rick day goes a long way in making the humidity worse...PU-No pic today Nat, I sure hope they were sent this time, but I will suck it up and email him if when and if it becomes necessary..."Dear Rick, have you cleaned your desk yet?"  Leslie-I hope the weather has calmed down for you, I hate lightening....to this day it freaks me out. It's nice your neighbors were wanting to check on Mrs. Blake, I'm not sure that would happen around here...Thanks for the Dan Rather-not mental image....when I wake screaming, I'm gonna call you....:-O Two of MY last books were O'Reilly's also, but I'm now reading one on an Italians perspective on living in the US, it's pretty funny.  I caught that pre-taped story of Rick's last night too, it must have been a cosmic thing...I never watch Fox that late on the weekends...  Since we're 'fessing up, I graduated in 85, so it seems I may be the elder member, but I may also be the closest in age to the guys....Although I think maybe Teri is a bit older than me....  Has anybody ever noticed the promo pic of Shep for Fox Report makes him look like Liberace??? Look at it next time, during Studio B is when I see it the most. That's not my favorite, I like the promo for The Pulse much better....  BTW I sure hope Sheppo doesn't 'mishandle' the soap...........
