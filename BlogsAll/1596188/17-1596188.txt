Oh, girls, I'm *so* glad it's Friday- it's been a day from hell already & it's only noon.  A co-worker got a call from one of our insureds (we insure MD's) who was quite unhappy (more like very irate).  It went a little like this: he was very angry and threatening and was upset that his policy wasn't amended as requested 3 mos ago and that he'd spoken with many people regarding changing his policy.  He expressed his frustration with the "incompetent people" here and said he was "bloody fed up" and felt that he needed to "come to our office with a gun" in order to get things done.  Now, the way people are these days, you just never know.  To make matters worse, he's one of the MDs that falls in one of the counties I handle, so that's not a great comfort to me.  I'm *this* close to just throwing in the towel, packing up my crap and saying sayonara.  But I *need* the profit sharing.....so I just keep focusing on the future.  Geez, I could really use that signed picture of Rick right now- I'm really hoping it gets here today.  Jan- it may take awhile :(  so don't get discouraged.  Back to the work thing, though- there are so many unhappy people here & also the insureds.  I feel terrible, 'cause I know what kind of job I can do but am limited by our system and lack of enough people here to do the work.  I've got 8 out of 12 of the So. CA counties & a huge broker (who have invited me to go river rafting a week from Weds- I wanna go, but it kinda scares me- anyone here done that before???).  I'm just trying to hang in there.....I'm putting a copy of that signed pic up front & center as soon as it gets here!! :D
