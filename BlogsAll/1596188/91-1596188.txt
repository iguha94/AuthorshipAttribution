All this talk about books got me thinking, out of the last 5 books I've read, two were Bill O'Reilly's and the other three had heroines with interesting occupations: New York homicide detective, bounty hunter and vampire executioner. What does that say about me and my mindset?  Shep was, well, delicious tonight. Very playful and just Shep.  Do any of you watch The Pulse on Thursdays? Mr. Smith is not only hosting, but will also have a piece of reporting on the show this Thursday.  Looking into a prison for the criminally insane.  Don't know if he's looking to relocate, or if this is for me after I'm convicted of stalking. The preview last week showed Shep going through a frisking before entering the prison.  What I wouldn't give....  Got the girls out of the pool long enough to choke down some dinner.  They're back out there. No need to check for tan lines, there aren't any.    Nat, Nan - can I join the Glow-in-the-dark Club?  My hubby always said he could find me in total darkness as long as I was naked.  I burn, blister, peel, and freckle.  And forget about the freckles all growing together for a tan look, they're not all the same shade.  I graduated '85, and love 80s music. But now I've gotten into 70s music, I'm a closet disco queen and not too ashamed to admit it.  Queen, the Eagles, Elton John, some great music came out of that decade not related to the Bee Gees or John Travolta.  Well, got a couple of IMs going and can't concentrate on more than two things at once. Ya'll have a good night.
