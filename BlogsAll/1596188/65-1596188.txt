hmmmm, I'm not sure how much I like this new blogger, it's awful small. *wonders how to add new members now*  Jen called me just about 15 minutes ago. She's doing fine, and enjoying her protien shake *not!* And has the unjustice of NO Fox News at the hospital. She thinks she gets to come home tomorrow, but probably won't post until this weekend. I was relieved to hear from her, since I was a little worried last night.  Natalie - sorry to hear about your icky time at work, and no photo yet. If Rick is anything like me, then he'd forget his head if it weren't attached to him, even though it was right in front of him. LOL Hey you know what they say, "If it weren't for the last minute I'd never get anything done." I'm sure he's just procrastinating, or the people at the PO are. LOL Your book sounds awesome! You'll have to let us know how it's coming along, and if you get stuck you can always feel free to ask me for input. :) It's funny what little things can inspire such big things.  It's very awesome that FNC is beating CNN! And don't worry you two aren't the only butter knifes on the blog, consider me just about as dull as they come. :) I, like you, had never heard of Rick before the war. Oh well, now I have, and it's great knowing I can get reliable news from such a stud. :)  Well it's time for dinner and my tummy is grumbling at me, so I must do what it asks of me. LOL Talk to ya gals later. Oh yeah, and for all you all *roasting* in the sun, all I have to say is it was 70 degrees here today! =P
