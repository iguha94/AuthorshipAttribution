Denise!  I'm so excited for you!!! But.....*wails* WHERE'S MINE?????  Oh, I really really hope so!!!!  Oh, good Lord, it's going to be forever till Monday! LOL!  I've *NEVER* so looked forward to MONDAY!  *hoping hoping hoping* it's there.......please? Pretty please?  With a ......oh nevermind- I won't go there!  So, what did he say on it???? You're holding out on us! ;-D  LOL- I've *joked* about curling up under my desk to hide/sleep but I'd never *actually do* it.  Hopefully she gets what she deserves....  but I know what you mean.  My saying is, if someone can get caught, I will be the one that gets it- so that's why I tend to play by the rules and not stray more than an inch from 'em.  And I'm a *horrible* liar, so I couldn't do any better than dig deeper if I did get caught doing something I shouldn't- LOL   Thanks for the condolences- wow, I'd find that really creepy if I dreamed of someone being pregnant and then there was a death- that's heavy symbolism!    Oh, gosh, I'm sooooo excited now- I hope he mailed all of us LevenGals who are waiting for pics our copies too!  WOO HOO!!!! :-D  Jan- any luck?????   OK- I know if you got yours too, then mine's gotta be there either Monday or Tuesday- (Denise- if I remember correctly, you're on the East Coast, so it would make sense that you'd get yours fairly close to the postmarked date).
