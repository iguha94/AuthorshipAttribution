Good Evening Everyone!!! It was a roasting hot one on the east coast today.  I might have got to 100 and with the humidty it felt like 120.  I think it is supposed to cool down tomorrow though which i a good thing but we have had 4 whole days with no rain.  Nat - I just saw Todd on The Fox Report.  I hope you got to see it, it sounds like you needed a Todd sighting.  I'm sorry you are having such a hard time at work.  I know how you feel.  I had so many frustrations at my job and people not doing their job, coming in late.  I would write them up and go to HR and HR would never back me up.  I had employee lying on her time sheet time and time again and I could never get her fired.   I get that all the time at work  from people who are so behind, yet they call in sick all the time and never get in any kind of trouble and we always have to pick up the slack.  Hang in there.   Jayel - I was thinking Rick was probably on vacation too.  It would be a good time to go like you said.  Thanks for sharing the stuff about CNN and that Fox is still beating them.  I wonder how Paula's new show is doing??  LOL, I'm sure Shep will let us know.   Okay the craziest thing happened.  I was typing my blog and there was someone else's message showing up on mine I had to highlight and erase it.  I don't know what that was all about.  Gotta go get myself pack.  Going camping this weekend.  I'll check in later
