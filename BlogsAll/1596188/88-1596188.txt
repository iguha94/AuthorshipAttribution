hey ladies!  It has been a really long day, but at least Mad Monday is almost over!  No firemen today, it is a shame since it was really hot here and they could have gotten the hoses out and.....I'd better stop there.  Melissa I could use your photography skills to maybe make a calender hmmm  Nat   Don't feel embarrassed, I actually named my childhood dog after one of the members of Duran Duran! (that seems to be theme with me)  There is an 80's station here that I listen to all the time, sometimes I get embarrassed if the windows are down in the car and I'm bopping to Rick Springfield, because of course I seem to remember all the words to all those songs from the 80's LOL!  I think I like it so much because life was so much simpler, I didn't have to worry about paying bills, or going to work everyday, my biggest concern was whether my parents would let me stay out late that night. or if that cute boy would call.  The music just evokes that feeling of being carefree.  Melissa  I hope you're feeling better, at least it is a rainy day there, not much to do but read.  I can totally relate to time flying while reading, I've actually stayed up all night because I couln't put a book down.  Sometimes I have no patience and I sneak a peek at a few lines of the last page!  Leslie  wow, great gift, I know it won't take the place of your hubby, but it was certainly a nice gesture.  If you get lonely, you always have us!   Well I must go I am trying to find an outfit for tomm, I am going to see Pearl Jam, my seats are in the first few rows!  I really hope Eddie Vedder doesn't decide to start spouting off about politics, I'm not in the mood...I'm there for the music.  Sorry, had to get that off my chestl  Jen  Best wishes tomm,  I know everything will be fine!  Catch you all later!
