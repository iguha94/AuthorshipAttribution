ARGH Why are there so MANY food commericals on tv?! -- I went for my daily walk w/ my mom today and was like "mom - no walking on July 4th I can't stand to smell cookouts" I'm just looking forward to the end of my 8 week puree from hell menu -- I'm having a nice grilled cheese sandwich and maybe a sliver of BBQ Chicken ... today was a so-so day for me, a lot of "wound" pain but one crushed percocet every 6 hours seems to do the trick ... let's see for today it was:  1 tsb of baby oatmeal and 2 tsb of baby pears for breakfast  *2* crackers and 2 cheese cubes for lunch  *2* crackers with peanut butter for dinner mmmmmmm I found out some good news today -- not only will I eventually be able to eat salad but a nurse who had the same surgery told me that eventually I'll be able to eat .... *mouth watering* FILET MIGNON because it's tender ugh counting down the days until I can "eat" again 51 days....  Tried to have my protein shake -- dutch chocolate is NOT what I thought i'd be BUT my calcium (SP) (2 tsb of sour lemon) mixed in with 8 oz of Lemonade was pretty good -- chalky looking but good... let's see ah tomorrow for the day is lookin' like this: 2 tablespoon of baby food peaches for breakfast 1/2 of a deviled egg for lunch  2 tablespoon of salmon mixed with 1teaspoon of light mayo and 1 tablespoon of cooked brocolli for dinner mmmmm not quite exactly the steak and chicken fijatas that I read Leslie made a few days ago ... agh Leslie! Your daily food updates are going to kill me *thinking* 51 days left 51 days left 51 days left...
