         I spoke to R today. Actually, had a little fight too.  And to be honest, I feel much better.  It seems that the secret assignment he was on last weekend was a few days away to unwind and shake off the every day hell he works in.  This did not sit well with me and I told him so.  I told him that going off and disappearing for days was fine, but a call to say, "Hey babe, I just need a few days, I will call ya when I get back" would have been freakin nice.  Instead my wild imagination was running amuck and sending me into a tizzy. I also told him that I am not trying to be a bitch, all I want is for him to tell me the truth.  I don't care what it is, just be honest. I also warned him that leaving me with 10 days of no sex was very bad, very, very bad and he shall be punished. To which he liked, and we both laughed and all is happy in my little world right now.  R is on detail tonight, so I will stop by and get a little sugar and leave turned on from checking out his nice little ass in those sexy uniform pants. (Nothing like a tight pair of riding pants to get a girl going!!) Then I am off to meet a couple friends to work up a sweat shaking my bootie on the dance floor.   And if I am lucky, I will be working it up for a good cause....R better take a blue pill, cuz the girl is hungry!  Whats better than a little make-up sex, huh?
