         Of the three men that have popped up in my life in the past week, the one that I wanted the most has been transfered. The Firemen.   Before he and I met, he had put in for a job transfer to Langley AFB, and Saturday he got the call of acceptance.  He told me this morning, via internet, that he was sorry and he hoped I understood.   Gawd...it's not like we were an item or anything, didn't even kiss him.   I wished him good luck on his new job, and wished him the best in his future.  {Sigh} But he was really cute, Darn, darn, darn.  I have not heard from Mr. Fix-it today, but it's early and I know he will call and wonder what I am up to.  He had become a little possesive on Saturday, expected me to go over to his place or invite him over.  No, not the way it works buddy. He has been properly informed as to how it does work and he will accept it.  Tico called.  He wanted to let me know he waited for me on Friday night.  Hmmmmm, I do not recall an invite.  He told me that he was hanging out with friends, I took that as he was busy.  No biggie.....The next time he will have to be more assertive, I don't read minds.
