         Part of last nights dream has me befuddled.  I have a grocery cart in front of me and I am walking into a store.   I see wood floors and wood walls.   I push my cart into the produce section and I want fruit, but all the fruit is rotten.  I am grossed out because I see black watermelon, and shriveled up strawberries, and I am angry that the potatoes and onions are fine.   I want fruit so bad I can feel my mouth watering, and tears welling up in my eyes, because I can't have any fruit.   I find myself wandering through the store, it has a musty smell, and every time I get to the end of an isle I have to turn around because I am at a dead end.   I have a few things in my carriage and I make sure they are things that won't go bad.   The items are in cans or jars. I am not sure what they are, but I know that they are good to eat.  Then, I get to the check out, and there are people, but they aren't standing in line. I can't get in line myself because I have to wait for them.  The only thing I know is I have 10 minutes to get out of the store.  At this point I woke up, so I don't know if I made it or not.  Ok, the end of the dream, or at the point I woke up, I understand, but what is up with the fruit?
