         I can't believe the men in this area that I live.  Have you been taught the meaning of, "I don't want to see you anymore" or "Don't call me"?  Not only did Mr. Fix-it call me last week and ask if we could "get together", but last night as I was weaving through traffic, and finishing up a call to the local radio station because I won tickets to the "3 Doors Down" concert in February, I had a call beep in.  I finished my call to the station and checked my missed calls.  The number there looked familiar, but I couldn't place it, so I called it back.  A man answered and I asked if he had tried to call me.  He said, "Ohhh yes, I did, this is Mike", ohhh no the Mortician.  I haven't spoke to him in 6 months, why was he calling me now? After a couple minutes of pregnant pauses and uncomfortable silences, I came out and said, "We just didn't work out". I heard him sniffle on the other end and he started to bawl like a baby.  He then started to yell at me and tell me how we were so perfect together and he loved me and we had something special.  After a minute of this I realize he is drunk. And then, (I am serious here, this is true) my phone started to break up, so I could only hear every other word or so.  So I finally said, "Hello, Hey I can't hear you...Hello....Hey, Have a nice holiday, my phone is acting up and I can't hear....hello?  Ok, good bye"  Another classic case of don't drink and dial.
