         Today I spent most of my time doing "Car Accident Crap".  Call car insurance.  Call doctor.  Get call back from doctor.  Get call from car rental place.  Get accident claim cancelled.  Call back insurance company.  Get claim reinstated.  Call car repair place.  Have claim cancelled on me again.  Crap, call insurance company again.  Drama....Ohhh, the drama.  And all thru that, D sticks there with me.  He is my calm.  He makes me laugh thru it all.  He is a wonder.  He makes me wonder why.  He knows I am PMS'n(what a bonus, huh?), he knows my back is sore, he is supportive and accommodating to my needs.   He drove me to the doctor and went into the examining room with me.  He drove me back home and stayed with me the rest of the afternoon while I made phone call after phone call.  To do this he had taken the afternoon off of work. He is the man!  I finally got my rental.  The very nice German boy, Georg, saw my flusteredness and felt bad for me.  He ended up upgrading me to a Mercury Sable, 2004.  Ohhh, talk about luxury!  Except one thing....why do they put tape players in rentals?  All I have are CD's, my tapes are in the bottom of a box somewhere and so old(80"s Pop), Ugh!     PS: Since D will be reading this on Thursday the 29th....Happy 3 weeks Baby! (HeHee)  XXOO!  PPS:  Thanks Momma!! You made my evening with   this .  I so loved this show!!!  Listening to it as I post...Eeeeeee!
