         Well....I made it, it's Friday!  I completed one full week of classes, only 12 more to go.  Last night was my English class and I thought I would hate it from the start, but I think I am gonna give it a chance.  I am not thrilled with doing argumentative essays, but there are only five and they don't have to be any longer than 450 words.  Not like the 12 page research paper from hell I am going to have to more than likely buy for my American Government class.  I will deal with it, I can deal with it.  Just one week at a time.  This week of classes has been surrounded by other tasks that don't normally fill up my schedule.  My parents have been out of town, so I have been housesitting and taking care of their animals.  The getting my lazy ass out of bed by 5am, to get ready for work, drive over to their house, feed the animals, and then get to work by 7:30, has cut into my sleep time. Also my Mom is the bartender for the VFW post and I have had to fill in for her.  I don't mind it, it's the cheap-assed old-timers, that whine and complain about how crappy their lives are and yell at me if they think I cheated them on a drink.  What the fuck do you want for a buck and fifty cents....Crown Royal?  Go down the street buddy, I can survive without your quarter tip....WTF!  Breath.....Mom and Dad will be back tomorrow...one more day, just one more day.  Tomorrow...ahhhh, can hardly wait.  Going to a Luau.  It's gonna be a blast!  Hopefully dancing after, depends on how I am feeling.....with my full schedule this week, I have been plagued with a severe sinus attack....ughhh!  It's Friday and I made it....I did, I did!
