         I would like to start off by thanking the VFW members for giving me my token $6.25 in tips, which would have been less if my Mom hadn't slipped three bucks in my purse before I left.   I can now retire! Went by Legends after work for a little dancefloor workout with   J  and when I get there I almost missed her, because she is on the floor doing a line-dance with Red....Hmmmmmm?  She says he was there when she got there, but no need to explain to me, you are an adult.  After about an hour, it was time for me to go home, so I left J in the "somewhat stable" hands of Mr. Red. On my way home, I gave my man, Irv, a call.  I missed him and I am getting very, very excited about seeing him next week.  Anyway we were chatting away and he said, "Remember, you're not supposed to fall in love with me."  My comment was "Too late."  He was obviously put back by this and said that we were not going to go there, because it would put too much pressure on us next weekend.  I reassured him that there was no pressure, that my intentions are to go visit a friend and enjoy myself. All that said, let's put some clarity on the "Love" issue. I am a very loving and caring person (when I am not being selfish, I swear it's true), I have lots of friends, as well as acquaintences.  My friends are very special to me and I love each and every one of them.  This does not mean that I want to be intimate with them, it means I care about them.  There is a difference between love and "LOVE".  Ok?  Understand?  Good!    And my friends (in no particular order):   J , Keith, Janet, Nancy, Ali, Mark F., Billy-boy, Noah, Toad, Mike C., Sampson, Kat, Steve T., M & S, Jenn(Idaho), Julie(and her baby Coral too), D'Egidio(forever in our hearts), Dickie, Cheryl, Popcorn, Lenny, Lionel, Roz, Norella(Where are you?) and last but not least Irv. Don'tcha just feel the love?
