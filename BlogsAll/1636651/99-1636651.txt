         D met us all for lunch today.  Me,   J ,   K  and   W .  D sat and waited for us all, for an hour.  He is such a sweet man. I arrived first and at the table were 4 sets of flowers, one for each of us.  I glowed inside, wanting to just cuddle up this man and keep him all to myself. Hug him. Kiss him. And all that good stuff. Lunch was good and over.  They all left to go back to work and I had taken the rest of the day off. I have the time, I am taken advantage of it. So, D and I headed back to my place.  As we walked up the walkway, I said, "betcha son is still asleep on the couch".  Guess what.....I won.  The rest of the afternoon was spent enjoying each other...so much so that Son asked that next time to please tell him to leave the house.  Ohh, sorry dude!  Afterwards, D was sitting in front of my computer and I was laying on my bed and the conversation lead to us.  And feelings.  Mostly my feelings. I will admit, I do have feelings.  For him.  I am not sorry about it.  It happened.  And ya know what, I have not felt this good in a long time.  If that is wrong then too bad, cuz I don't care.  He left and I thought I wouldn't be seeing him again for a few days.  His work schedule is not compatible with mine, so thems the breaks. So a couple hours later, I pulled up to a bar where some friends of mine were playing pool tonight and surprise, surprise...he was standing at the door.  It was great...it just was.  Sleep now, with a smile.....Man, it's been a long time since I have had this.
