         Dad stopped by my cube and informed me that Momma had surgery yesterday.  Okay...... 1) I work with my dad and he did not tell me that momma had surgery scheduled. 2) I live less than a mile from my parents house and nobody stopped by to tell me. 3) I spoke to my momma on Tuesday and she did not say a word. 4) My sister knew. Hellllooooooo people, I am not a mind reader! Tell me WTF is going on in my own family! Geeeeez!  So now, I have spoken to my mother, informed her that I am running the bar tonight and she filled me in on the whole story. Momma was diagnosed with Bowen's Disease, a slow developing type of skin cancer, a couple weeks ago.  The area effected was a patch on her back about 1 x 2 inches.  The doctor did a biopsy and they were waiting on the result.  Yesterday, she went in and they immediately put her on the table because the tests revealed "Basal Cell Carcinoma".  She is in some pain, the result of cutting a large area out of her back and about a hundred stitches, but she was given some happy pills so she isn't too grumpy and she did not put up a fight about staying home from work tonight.  In the end, family is forgiven for not telling me in advance, because they didn't know, BUT......someone could have left me a voicemail last night, ya know!  PS: Momma will be ok, they believe they got it all and she will be going in for regular checks and staying out of the sun.
