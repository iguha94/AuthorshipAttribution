         Went over to my momma's last night.   I know, it sounds exciting, but funds are a little tapped, I had Vet bills, and she had beer in the fridge.  Anyway, I get over to Momma's and she has gifts for me.  She went shopping in the Quarter and found a purse I had been looking for.  It's adorable.  I just love it.   There is a story behind this too.  The little boy in the picture, his name is Ferman aka "Flip".  Flip's mother took this picture in 1947 and it eventually won a Kodac contest.  Flip also went to the Coast Guard academy with my dad.   Pretty cool huh?  Mom also gifted me with a misplaced Christmas gift and told me another one is coming as soon as it is found.  I collect Teddy Bears, so she added to my collection more with a "911" policebear and firebear.  The firebear is still missing.  Later in the evening a friend of my mom's came over and we headed to the casino.  Mom spotted me some money and I sat at a slot machine.  I put in $10.00 and played it for over 2 hours, then as I was about to cash in my coins, I hit for a hundred.  Whoo hoo me! It was much needed....now I can buy some food for the fridge.  Now back to my exciting life...later.
