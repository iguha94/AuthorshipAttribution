         I have spoken with "Him" a few times today, he calls me 3 or more times a day.   Mostly to say "Hello baby".    I am not complaining, I am just not used to all this attention.  He knows this and, yes, it sometimes makes him angry that I am in doubt of his real feelings.  It's not that I have a doubt as to how he feels, it's just that those feelings of inadequacy, the insecurity, the lack of confidence that I have in myself (that I hide very well, thank you) make me feel I am undeserving of his praises.  He tells me not to base "us" on my past.  That I should look into the future.  I understand the concept, but the memories and conditioning are difficult to just drop, to be free of it.  I am a product of my environment and even when I changed my environment, my history stayed with me.  It is part of me.  I am slowly dealing with my issues, developing the me that I like.   The sassy girl that I know I am, not the Girl-Interrupted that I was a long time ago.  He says he will be there for the long haul, he says no matter what he will always be my friend.  He wants to take care of me, to fix me and make me whole again.  He wants to hear me smile as well as see it.    You know what, this scares the living crap out of me.....it really does.
