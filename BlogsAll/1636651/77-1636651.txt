         Happy New Year!!!!!!  2003 was an adventure and I look forward to new adventures in this coming year.  Last year at this time, I was tenatively still engaged to be married.    Good thing that didn't happen!  I'd have a slob living off my paycheck and I would have to be dealing with him poking me in the back with his woody at 3 in the morning.  Every night!  Yuck!  I am grateful to him though, he taught me that I wasn't in love with him.    Can I love?  Yes I can.  I encountered this past year the "Daiquiri Dude", he taught me that I could love again.   And because of him I know there is hope for me.    Yes, I have had my up's and down's over the year.   The Stalker Mortician, and the "you can break up with me", "Yo, is Leroy there?" Mr. Fix-it, and the married(no I am not) cop, and the "he had to be gay" Lawyer, and the "I need 80 buck's to pay my pool bet and tab" Greek boy.   But I have had good ones too.  Mr. Atlanta, his kind heart, I will be his friend forever, then there was the Fireman...hmmmm, ohhh who could forget him, Yummmm.  And ....well, maybe when he says it's ok to post him.  Those good ones have taught me and helped me.  I can love and I am lovable.  This New Year...I will not have a resolution...I am just gonna love.    My toast--Thank you for loving me, I love you bunches!    To 2004!  Hooray!!
