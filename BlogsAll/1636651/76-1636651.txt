           This is my man.  Shadow Man.  He isn't doing to well and I had to take him to the vet today.  He has lost a lot of weight and he has been stumbling around.  The stumbling part I attributed to age, since he is 15, but last night he tried to jump on my bed and he missed. He has never missed before. So I called the vet office this morning and they told me to bring him right in.  The doctor examined him, poked and prodded him.  He mewed and growled.  The doc noted that his back teeth were in pretty bad shape, and he had a small mass in his colon, but neither would really attribute to his dramatic weight loss.(2 pounds in the last 6 months). The doc took blood, which turned into a cluster-fuck and two collapsed veins, they finally drew out enough for testing.   The doctor thinks it may be Renal failure, but is more inclined to diagnose a Thyroid problem because of the stumbling and there was no sign of blockage in his colon. Shadow became more active after the blood draw and obviously was ready to go home.  The doctor told me to take him back home while they ran the tests, if the tests come back that there is a serious problem, I will have to bring him back to the hospital.  Shadow was not pleased with this news and to prove his displeasure he urinated in the waiting room.  He is such a good boy.  Anyway...now we wait.  You would think after handing over 200 bucks there would be some more definite answers.  The things you go though for the males in your life.
