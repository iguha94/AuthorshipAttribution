         I just don't get it. I have been in a drought of no dates, no men, no action for weeks and the past 3 days it's been like a torrential downpour.  I have been talking to Tico for months and finally, he met me for coffee last night after class.  He showed up late, but he called, so that was forgivable.  Anyway, he got there a little after 8 and at five minutes to 11, I was saying goodnight to him in the parking lot.  We talked and talked...ok, he talked and talked.  I think I pretty much know everything about this big ol' Teddy Bear.  He is sweet, and crazy, and he is a good man.  Kind-hearted, gentle, and sincere. (Oh, he is gonna hate it when he reads this.) He has the desire to be bad, but either he doesn't know how or he has a fear of the consequences.  I will continue to talk to him, I like him...why? He is freakin nuts, that's why...oh, and he owes me dinner.  Mr. Fix it.  Miss J met him over the weekend and gave him my number.  We have talked on the phone a few times, including a two hour marathon of laughs.  He seems really nice, and funny, and confident.  He knows how to be bad, understands the meaning of non-relationship sex, and talks the talk.  I think we have some kind of date on Friday night, if he gets his race-car fixed to the way he likes it.  If he doesn't I am shit out of luck...wait, no, he is shit out of luck.  Then there is Mr. Fireman.  Mr. Fireman is young.  He is single.  He is tall.  He is good, he knows the meaning of F*Buddy, and he isn't looking for a serious relationship.  He is meeting me for coffee before class today to chat.  We are getting together Saturday for drinks.  Mr. Fireman will not be disappointed.  I think I am gonna need a life-preserver!
