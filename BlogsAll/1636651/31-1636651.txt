         Well, I met the Fireman last evening.  The original plan was to meet at Borders Book Store for coffee, and to call him as soon as I got in the parking lot.  I was driving on the side road next to the store and I looked over to the lot and I saw him walk in.   OMG!!! He is gorgeous, freakin, roll me over gorgeous!!!  I pulled in the lot and called him, he was upset that the place was packed and he suggested going over to Starbucks instead.  I agreed and he walked out of the store and straight toward me (since I was standing by my car).  He stood in front of me, all 6'3" of hunk of burning desire, and he smiled at me.  Then he looked me in the eye and said, "You are so cute."  {Blush} Me, cute....Ohhh my.   The next hour and a half we sat there talking, his parents, his job, my job, my kids, pets, vacations, etc.... I remember almost every word and I was lost in those beautiful brown eyes.  He had said we would get together Saturday, but his parents had something come up (Parents are older, Dad had knee surgery, Mom is in remission from Breast Cancer) and they want him to drive them to Biloxi.  He said we were intellegent adults and we would figure something out.  He wants to see me again, to talk, to get to know each other, and this is ok with me. He asked if I would like him to walk me to my car. "Yes, Please." He asked if he could call me tomorrow. "I told him he better." Then, he bent over to hug me, Nice, very nice.  He liked it too, and hugged me again.  A quick peck good-night and he was off to his Union meeting and I was off to class. Hmmmmmm....now I am more frustrated...but not for long, and that is a promise.
