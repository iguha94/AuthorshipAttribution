         Another Mac Guy, who is new to Blogger world, started up today and of course posed the following question: Have you ever been involved with someone and then their best friend hits on you? How do you handle that? Do you just ignore it? Tell your other half and hope they believe you?   My answer is yes I have been there and told the significant other. I was engaged to be married a year ago and we, my fiance and I, went to a bar that he and his friends were regulars at.  He wanted to introduce me to his friends and hang out.  Great! Anyway, we had been there a couple hours and one of fiance's friends, his best friend as a matter of fact, came over to me and said I would have a better time with him than my fiance.   I laughed, I thought it was a joke.   We left and I really didn't think much of it, except flattered, cuz the friend is/was 24 years old.  Well, some how the guy got my phone number and I would get calls all hours of the day, mostly hang up calls, but annoying none-the-less.  After a few weeks of it, I told my fiance.  Of course he did not believe me, so one night the fiance was over my house, a night he usually wasn't and the phone rang.  I told him to look at the caller-ID and who's name was on it....Tah Dah!  Well, he went and talked to the guy, the guy blamed it on me, of course, but at least it was over or so I thought. unbeknownst to me, the guy kept talking about me and this put a strain on our relationship.    We ended up breaking up, but at least I know I was true and I was honest.  In a relationship, if you want it to last, you have to be honest.
