         I finally got up the nerve to meet up with "him" Wednesday night.  Him being a man I started talking to a few months back.   It seems our relationship took a different turn in the last few days, we have become closer, more intellectually involved, parralleling each other, complimenting, very different for me.  I had a little study thingy after work Wednesday and he called to say hello, and he called again to ask me to call him when I was done.  The study thingy broke up and I stopped at my Chica's bar to have a cocktail.  While there, I gave him a call and asked him where he was.  I had been sitting there and it really hit me that in about 24 hours he would be going back to work and I would not have another chance to see him until he came back in 3 weeks, so I headed out to meet him when I finished my drink. It was about 8:30 when I picked him up, and we cruised the lakefront and talked.  The sweetie burned me a few CD's of Jazz, Wow, gifts, I like this.  I put one in my CD player and we listened to the smooth Sax of Boney James, it was wonderful.  We ended up at this hole-in-the-wall-dive of a bar, talking and listening to music.  Where the time went I have no idea, but before we knew it it was 11 o'clock and I had to work the next morning. As it turns out, I didn't get to sleep until 3am, Thursday was a hell of a day, but it was worth it, I learned so much about this man. He is a wonderful, caring, gentle man.   He is from my past.   Our souls have met before.   He is comfort in my tormented world.   He accepts me for who I am. He is my friend and always will be. Forever a part of me.
