         I know....I have not posted in a few days.  Been very busy. Drinking. Frolicking. Being merry.  No, not really.  Had the work holiday party on Friday.  Food, wine, making merry...yey, I won 50 bucks!  Personally I would have chosen a different restaurant, and if there is a party next year I really do hope they choose a new place to eat. We ended up at Razoo's after, a few beers, a few shots and it appeared that all had left for other festivities by 7.  My son picked me up and we went to Crazy Johnnies for dinner and after filling my tummy with steak and mashed potatoes I was in dreamland by 10pm.  I am such a party animal!  I can honestly say, I behaved...yeah, it surprised me too.  I didn't pick anyone up, I didn't give out or get a phone number and my shirt stayed on.  Saturday, I played domestic and crafty.  I stayed home and made Christmas presents for friends, which they better appreciate.   Later, Son and I went to the Pub and played some pool.  Son was getting upset because these two guys kept eyeing my butt.  Turned out their wives were sitting at the bar.  Very typical! Losers!  Not that I was interested, because I wasn't.  Yes, they were attractive, I just wasn't in the mood to play the game.  Bleh!  That has been my mood lately, not interested.  The game is tiring.  I have decided to take a break, purge my system of the men that have been in my path these past couple months.  Regroup and start over.  I will try to stay away from little Greek boys, Firemen, Policemen and even him's...though I can't promise anything.  I will try.
