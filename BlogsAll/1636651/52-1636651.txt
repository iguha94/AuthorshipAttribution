         I am still amazed by the twist of events that occurred last night.  I met up with my friend W at a local girlie bar for some shaking of bootie and maybe a little action for me.   The band "Blaze" was playing great mellow type tunes and I must say the lead singer "Whitney" is one hot looking woman and what a voice she has.   Blaze took a break and the dance music blared from the speakers.  W and I were on the floor, dancing and out of the corner of my eye I saw him put his hand on the shoulder of this rather nice looking woman, we will call her Jane.  He leaned over and said something, Jane shrugged and spun over to her partner who was another woman.   What happened next is the twist part.  Jane's partner nodded at her and then she nodded towards W.  In that kind of nod that means go for it.  Well, thru the rest of the song and the next song too, Jane was boogying up to W, giggling to her partner and eyeing W like he was a medium-rare steak fresh off the BBQ grill. When W and I sat for a sec to catch our breath, I leaned over and said, "Hey, those women were flirting with you!"  He got this shit-eating grin on his face and said, "Yea, I know, isn't it great." Though this is a wonderful thing to happen to W.....my point is, we were in a girlie bar.  I wanted some too, damn it.
