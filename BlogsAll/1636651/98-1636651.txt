         It's a Monday.  As usual it started out crap, with more dilemmas with Son. Son decided to stay out all night, with my car, which had me calling him and tracking him down so I could go to work. I grumpily left him standing in the livingroom, mouth hanging open, as I refused to let him drive me to work so he could then have my car all day as well. The Balls that boy has. I am actually considering, saying screw them all, and moving out on my own.  My own apartment, my own space, my own opportunities to just run around nekkid when I feel like it.  Then I think about it, and the sappy mom feelings come out.  I know I will not do it.  I will just suffer with the crap.  Be miserable in my own house.  Suffer the unavailability of the livingroom couch(because that is where he sleeps, cuz he is too lazy to go upstairs).  Suffer the nasty man smell in the fibers.  The odor of feet permeating the air.  For all this, what will be my reward?  I can tell ya none of the following:  No return of my own stereo. No unlimited use of my own car. No bubblebaths with the door open. No beer left in the fridge. No seat down when I go to use the terlit. No empty sinks. No, No, No!
