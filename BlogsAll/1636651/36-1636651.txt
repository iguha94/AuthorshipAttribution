         In reading my Horrorscope this morning, it told me that I may be passing by some fun.  That it may be right in front of my face.    Below is the Yahoo Horrorscope: *Do some sort of check of yourself in which you re-evaluate what exactly it is that you are working for, Vixie. If it is fun and relaxation that you are after, maybe you are actually passing it by without even realizing it. The fun you seek is right there in front of your face, and it would be best if you take advantage of it now instead of waiting until some magic hour at which point you feel you have earned it.  Hmmmmmm, depends on your definition of fun.  Below is an Instant message I recieved shortly after I read my Horrorscope: (Please note that the screen name has been altered to protect the guilty)  looneytunes: you are beautiful  vix: excuse me......lol looneytunes: was searching new orleans profiles, came across yours, saw your pic, think you are beautiful vix: thank you looneytunes: you are welcome looneytunes: i am 6'2" 205lbs athletic brown hair blue eyes vix: and.... looneytunes: married and playing{devil face} ...not hiding it looneytunes: want to see my pic  He sent two....one of himself and one of "himself".  After a few more minutes of, "awwww come on, have a romp with me!" He figured out I wasn't in the mood for the sneaking around, Blah! I really don't think the Horrorscope meant that kind of fun.  Dang, what ever happened to "hey baby, can I take you to dinner?"
