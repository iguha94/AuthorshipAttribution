         Last night was my first night of school for this semester.  Algebra.  Fun....No no no...I have taken this class before.  I am so sick of this class.  My credits were not transferable, so here I am...in Junior High and bored, already!!  I get to class and the teacher walks in....Mr. Li....great, thick Japanese accent too.  Hands are being raised, questions about problems, etc. etc.  I am looking at the paper he hands out, class schedule, blah, blah, blah...and I notice the final exam date and time.  My hand goes up and I ask, "Excuse me, this is a night class correct?" He said yes. "Then why is the Final on a Monday morning?", I ask.  "Departamental" he says and asks us to open our books.    Hmmmm, I will be at the school before the end of the week, this is Bullshit!  So, anyway, Mr. Li, opens his mouth and in a monotone, Japanese accent, starts to explain Algebra.  I am flipping pages, high-lighting this and that.  Chin in palm, I don't remember dropping my high-lighter, but I remember my elbow slipping off the desk and my face almost hitting my book, and I snorted.  I look around, nobody seems to have noticed, I hear Mr. Li say, "Now if you will turn to page 70" I look down and I have already high-lighted past page 110.....I groan and say out loud, "Somebody shoot me!"  It's gonna be a long semester.
