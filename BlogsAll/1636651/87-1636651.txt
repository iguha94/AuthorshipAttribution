         Since 1994 I have thought of myself as a Sports Bra Kind of woman.  Slip over the head and ready to go, ya know what I mean? Actually, I was in a car accident in August of 94 and I hurt my back and neck and I bruised my ribs, so it was painful to wear a bra.   I wore spandex tops that were a size too small to hold the girls together and then I graduated to Sports Bra's when my ribs were healed.   I had a few regular bras, cheapo kind, never wanting to pay more than 10 bucks for something that nobody is going to see for very long.  I figured no matter if you paid 10 dollars or 50, it would still end up either around your neck or on the floor.  Anyway, Sunday, Miss J brought me one of her old "push the girls up" bras.  Later that night I tried it on and I got to tell ya....I couldn't see my feet.  I took one look in the mirror and was struck silent.   Why?  Because the Bra was a "D".  And I filled it.  Full. Holy Crap! I never knew I was a D....I always thought I was a C.  I guess that's what you get when you buy your crap at Wally-World. Not anymore, last night I was at Lane Bryant shopping.  I got 2 more of those sassy, hug-me, thrill seekers and a couple shirts that are low enough for ya'll to get a peek.  And ya know, since there is a sale on them, I may go back and get a couple more colors.  Ohh, the "little" things that make me Happy!
