         And so the day is over......  I woke this morning before my alarm went off.  Excited as a kid, not for gifts, but to spend time with my family.  This was the first year in too many to count that almost all of us were together(My daughter still lives up north). My brother and his family are here for the holidays, so an extra 4 people are at my folks house.  It's loud, it's crazy and I remember now why nieces and nephews are so much fun.....when I have had enough, I can go home.  My son and I arrived at the folks house around 9am, happily unloaded our contributions to the overflowing pile under the tree.  A tree that was only visible from three feet up.  The little ones were very patient as we finished with the starting of dinner and after everyone had a generous glass of Mimosa's, we tore into the presents.  My son was surprised by the 5 foot air hockey table, which will be assembled in my livingroom this weekend after I take down our tree.  I, on the other hand, was gifted with several pedicure kits(are they saying my feet are offensive?), a perpetual calendar adorned with Teddy Bears, a huge stuffed bear from son, a really pretty sweater and a floating candle set from daughter, a bear nativity, a lighted mirror with a magnifying reflection, a picture of a fairy sitting on the moon, a   2003 Jazz Festival Poster , and the best of all a Margarita set, which also came from son.  The Margarita set includes 4 glasses, a pitcher and a nacho tray.  Totally awesome, and I promise the next Margarita party is at my house.  As for the rest of the day. It was filled with stuffing face with too much food and cleaning up as the men slept in the livingroom.  Typical holiday.  Hope ya'lls was a fun filled as mine.  Merry Christmas all.
