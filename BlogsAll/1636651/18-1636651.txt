         I got a call today. Not the kind of call you would expect from your 18 year old son.  "Mom, what are you doing November 22nd to December 1st?" (I do the math in my head real quick, ohh, no..I didn't even know he had a girlfriend!)(I know I am pathetic, but every time one of my children calls me and says, guess what? or can we talk? or even if they call out of the blue, this wave of dread passes over me, I am so not ready to be a Gran-ma-ma, though I would make a really cool one!)  "Mom!?"  "Yes, Jon...Um.....I'm not doing anything, I don't think. Why?" I say.  "I miss you Mom, and I want to come visit."  Awww, weep, weep!  This is good weeping.  We chat for awhile, I get info for his flight and he is all set to head south.  Before he hangs up he pauses and says, "I Love You, Mom!"  And I Love you too sweetie....my little boy, he makes a girl smile, all 6 feet 6 inches and 250 pounds of him, "sigh".  After we hang up, I remember I had planned to go visit them, both him and his sister for Thanksgiving.  Well, at least I hadn't bought my ticket yet, whew!    Now I have a dinner to plan, which is good, I can cook, really!  Got to make a list, hmmm, Turkey, sweet potatoes, turnip, pumpkin pie from scratch...ohhh my, I only have 3 months to plan...heheheeee!  I wonder if my daughter "T" would be interested in coming down too?  I'll have to call her.  Ohhh, anyone else?  We found a card table in the closet last week, seriously.
