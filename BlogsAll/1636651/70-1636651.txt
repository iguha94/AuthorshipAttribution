         I spent today in a meeting.  I was what we call the page turner. I stood in front of a computer and clicked the pages for briefs, while speakers spoke their speeches through the microphone I clipped on their shirts, ties or jackets. The first few went well, even though on occasion the mic would screech when they handed it back to me. My embarrassment occurred when a kindly speaker came up to me and informed me that every click on the keyboard, every cough I spewed was annunciated thru a mic on the platform.  All went better after I found the hidden mic and unplugged it. It was finally over after almost 9 hours of torture.    By the time I left work, the cold I have had off and on for over a month hit my voice and took it away.  I was still determined to go meet someone for a cruise on his new bike.   Yes, I had a date. At about 8pm I went outside and noticed the temperature had dropped and my voice was completely gone.  With a shrug I knew it would be best to cancel.  So, I called the place we were to meet and asked if he was there.  He got on the phone and through my strain of trying to talk he was thankful I called.  The goober laughed at me, playfully.  And to my delight we made another date. He is taking me for a ride on his new bike on Saturday and he gave me his number incase I am still not feeling well.  What a thoughtful guy.  And now that the Nyquil has started to kick in, I must go to sleep or pass out on the keyboard.  But with a smile on my face! I have a date on Saturday...heheheheee, now if I could remember his name.
