         I know it's just after 10 PM and I want to write so much, but I am beat. I had a hard day today.... Making a new Database report (Thank you Jack!!! You are the most Awesomest Dude!!!)  and talking to my Customer  and reconfiguring my work load  and picking up my son from work  and making dinner for myself  and drinking a bottle of Wine while I watched "American Idol"... and Voting! Just exhausting!!  Plus...I was rudely awakened this morning at 4:16 AM!!!! My Text Message went off... It is loud! It is obnoxious!  I flew out of bed, because the first thing I thought was, "Son didn't come home and he was in jail" (Don't know why I thought that, maybe because he is like his Daddy, Anyway....), second thought, "Friend needed me, was sick or in hospital", and then the third thought, "Shit, Manda is in labor!!" (Manda, being sister that is ready to pop my new nephew out any minute).  These were the thoughts that went through my head in the two feet I had to reach over to get my phone. I fumble with it, I opened my eyes to read....and....  No, it was none of those thoughts...I had "SPAM"...What the Fuck!!!!  In the wee hours of 4:16 AM, I received a message from k8xvfv@netzero.net wanting to know if "I want a supermodel body?  I can TRIM 2 sizes in one month!  This new pill REALLY WORKS!  Just call (800)494-7185"  Well! You BITCH!!!  Ummm, NO! You woke me up!! Damn you SPAM!!!  And worst of it...I was in the middle of a really awesome sex dream!  Damn you SPAM!!  Now I am off to bed, I hope I can pick her up where I left her...
