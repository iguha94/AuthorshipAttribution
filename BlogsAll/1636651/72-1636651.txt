         I laid back on the bed and closed my eyes.  She wove her fingers in my hair and started to rub my scalp, from the top to the sides.  Her fingers splayed around my ears and she rubbed my lobes.  And soon I felt her fingers run across my face and down my nose.  My heartbeat was quickening and I had to be conscious to keep my hands at my sides, as she touched my face and massaged my cheeks. I felt her pull my bra-straps down my shoulders and I heard the squirt of lotion and soon I felt the coolness on my shoulders as she kneaded my neck and arms. My thoughts were not totally innocent, but I kept to myself with my eyes closed and laying as still as possible. She rubbed each arm, from my shoulders down to the fingertips.  Pulling each finger and rubbing my palms, holding my hand as she took care to touch every spot. She then pulled the sheet back and worked my legs, traveling down to my toes.  She paid an agonizing amount of time to my feet.  Rubbing the bottoms and sides till they felt like butter. When she thought she was done with the front, she asked me to turn over.   She then worked her way from my feet up.  Stopping for a moment at my butt, poking and massaging till it too was relaxed and pliable. Ohhh my god! She then took this massager and rolled it all over my back, I could feel it all the way to the front of me and it made me all tingley inside.  I heard myself start to scream in my brain and just then she covered me with the sheet and after a minute of beating on my sore muscles, she bent over and whispered in my ear.......  "You can rest here for a few and get dressed.  Meet me out front when you are ready."  Hmmmm, I think I will be needing another massage very soon, I believe I have found myself a LMT.  Ohhh, she was good, very good, almost as good as...........
