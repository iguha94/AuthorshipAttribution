         Last night I had originally planned to go to the "Spanish Festival" with my little Spanish Chica, but I just wasn't feeling up to crowds and standing around.  Plus I was tired, I did domestic all day and I even washed my car and Armor-all'ed the interior{Whats up with that?}.   Anyway, when she called I bowed out and told her we would get together another time. Not long after that, Miss J called and filled me in on her adventures of the day.  Practicing on her bike and even laying it down, in a not so gracefull manner, and getting scratched up.  She was in the mood to boogie and wanted company.  I declined, but thanked her. Feeling like I wanted to stay home, watch a movie, maybe have a glass of wine or two, I called Mr. Fix-it.  I told him I was going to be in and would like to get together.  He said sure, and that he would call me when he finished work. I did a little more house cleaning, took a shower and did some reading.  At 10 o'clock, maybe a little earlier, I put in the movie.  By the time it was over, I was sitting on the couch in tears.    Two weeks notice  isn't a tear jerker movie.  So why was I in tears, I was alone.  Again, I had wasted my weekend waiting on someone that says he wants to be my boyfriend.  Well, ya know what, not again....I really am sick of being taken advantage of, I am sick of being the one waiting around.  No more wasted weekends for this girl.  Gonna save the rest of the time I have, filling up the gas tank and heading West....I'll let you know where I ended up.
