         I went to the "Den" and ended up catching up with some friends.  Jenn showed, Yey!  So did a boy that had taken very good care of me last weekend in a time of need.   He played distant, he played little boy.  Ok, fine.  Jenn and I ended up going to "Legends" to shake some booty, leaving the boy at the Den.  I really enjoyed myself, I felt free and beautiful and sexy, all decked out in my 80's jeans, mustard shirt and sneakers.  Jenn flashin her Tats, and lookin way more sexy than I could ever be.  Fun, fun, fun...seriously!  We gave a hug goo-bye, promise to call tomorrow and headed to our separate homes. I was about 50 feet into my journey and my phone rang.  "Hey, where are you?"   Hmmmm, it was the boy.   I told him I had just left and I was on my way home.  He said, he was still at the Den and wanted me to come by.  I said, "You want me to come by?"  He said, "Yeah, I'll buy ya a beer."  I laughed and he then said................. "Yeah man, I gave her my card and I like don't have enough.  So my tab is like 28 dollars...Ohhh, and could ya stop and get 80 cuz I was playin pool."  I said, "Ya know...I ain't payin your tab.....I am going home, thanks though."  Yeah....Fucquad!
