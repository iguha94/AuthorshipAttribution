         Conan O'Brian is booming in the background as I stood on my balcony.  Standing there like a college girl, wearing a T-Shirt and panties.  The memory of earlier this eve flashing like a slide-show in my brain. I met D at the Sportswear store after work today.  We were standing next to my "rental" and we discussed the possibilities of seeing each other later.  I told him if he wasn't able to make it it was ok. I would see him tomorrow. And then I paused and then said, "allofyou". He backed away slowly, asking for me to repeat myself. I did.   I then sorted the words I said slowly in my head and I felt heat climb up over my face, embarrassed.  He thought I said The "L" word. Afterwards, it turned into a tease, of us both saying "allofyou" to each other. To be honest, it was kind of funny.  So, we did end up seeing each other later, we bantered back and forth with the "allofyou".  My chica met him and she gave a thumbs up and he left to do what ever he had to do.  Tomorrow I will see him again. After he plays golf, and I hope he thinks of "allofyou" while he is teeing off.  Again when he thinks he has a birdie.  Then again when he reads his score, no matter how awful it may be. When evening comes, he will be mine again.  All of mine.
