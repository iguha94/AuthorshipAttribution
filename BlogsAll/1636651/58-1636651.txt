         I ended up dressing up or should I say down and eventually went out with friends last night.  Me in a ankle length nightgown, hiking boots, way too much make-up and fake eyelashes(which everyone wanted to touch).  The Spanish chica, her dude friend Stew, Sab and Cass and I finally made it to the quarter about midnight.  Chica was an Alcoholic in prison garb, Sab was a little devil in her bikini top and cat-eye contacts and Cass was a dark angel. Stew was our pimp daddy in black.  After being stopped to get pictures taken by groping strangers (the twins will never be the same) and finding that just about every bar wanted a cover charge we headed back to Fat City. In Fat City we ended up at the Rainbow room. Yes, it had a cover too, but it was not crowded and we like the music and there was plenty of room on the dance floor.  Well, some of us, like Stew and myself, realized we had not be quenched....2 beers and a shot in the quarter....so he ordered a round of Vodka shots with a lemon on the side.   Surprisingly it went down smooth.   Dancing ensued.  Stew in his glory as 4 women were all over him, even with the known fact that two of them were a couple.   Over the next couple hours, beers were chugged, shots were downed in several different bars.  And then I looked at my phone for the time.  It was 6 am.   The sun was coming up.   You know what happens when that happens....when it's morning?   You realize you are drunk.   How did that happen?   Crap, I have to go to work in 4 hours....ohh crap!  Well, we took a cab home....Stew asleep on my lap...Chica asleep on my shoulder. Me, I was having Taxi Cab confessions with the driver. What did I confess, I am not gonna tell ya....but I will say, the Cab Driver wanted to walk me to my door.  Happy November everybody....It can only get better!
