         I ended up at the VFW last night.   Just me and my mom. Mom kept my wine glass full and we sat there, all teary eyed, reminiscing about Gram and kids and life. We made a packed that we will go back to the Cape and get a stone for Gram's grave, which we have been bad to not get one so far.  We even talked about going to Ohio and rescuing Aunt Gloria from the hell she is in.  Like two drunken fools could rescue anyone. I am not sure what time it was when I left, not even sure what time it was when I got home(Bad, very bad!).  I do know I turned on my computer and I do know I dialed Mr. Atlanta.   I need to call him later and apologize. I remember crying, I remember blowing my nose alot, and I remember tell him I loved him. This is why you don't drink and dial, you don't remember everything you said. Anyway, I think I said goodnight, and when I woke this morning...Oh, my aching head....I was still drunk.   I did notice this morning that I had a voice message, upon checking, apparently I had a message from the previous night that I had saved.  Mr. Fix-it decided to call after all.  He called at 10:15 last night and again this morning at 5:30.  Did I call him back?  No, at least I don't think I did.
