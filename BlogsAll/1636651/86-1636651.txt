         I have been debating all day whether or not to post this, but here I am.   Read it and weep. I did it again!  I had thought that Ray and I were going to dinner or something, but he called around 7:30 and told me it was nice enough for a bike ride.  I grabbed my leather jacket and we were on the road by 8.  It was nice.  The air wasn't too cold and the warmth of the man sitting in front of me was intoxicating. We cruised down River Road and over the Luling and as we were heading back on 90, he hollered over his shoulder that he had wanted to get a room.  I perked my eyebrow and he caught my look in his mirror, so he asked if I was up for that. Of course I was, I told him. Within minutes we were rolling around on a kingsized bed tearing each others clothes off.  It started rough and clumsily, but then we slowed down and it got a little better.  I found myself totally into it and the next thing I knew he was jumping off me and telling me he wanted to shower with me. Ok, but we hadn't really done anything, yet. I laid there for a few and heard him turn on the water.  I eventually made it to the bathroom and climbed in the tub with him. It was nice, I liked the shower scene and after we dried off was ok too. But when all was done, and we laid there and snuggled, I realized why he and his wife fought so much. He wasn't all that good.  I will probably be stupid enough to do it again.....just to make sure it wasn't just boring sex.  And if it turns out to be the ho-hum again, well, then I will be nice and slowly fade into an experience of his past.
