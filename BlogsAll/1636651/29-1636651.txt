         It's been a very long day, and feels longer, since I am tired from lack of sleep. (No, I was in bed alone last  night) I have been plagued by nightmares the past two nights, deep sleep ones, and I can't remember the entire dream.  All I know is, I was with people I know, friends and family, and I was trying to help them(I don't know what I trying to help them with), and the air was thick(it was hard to breath) and I couldn't keep up, and the Boogie-man was gonna get me if I went too slow.  Then I woke up, and I knew I had a dream, but I was confused as to where I was, and I was a little scared.  Scared because of the disorientation and scared because I knew I had a nightmare.  Weird! So today I analyzed the dream....what does it mean?  First, it is stress.  I know I took on too much with school.  I have 5 papers in English to do and that sucky 12 page paper for A.G.  and second, I need a vacation, I talked in my sleep last night, that is one of the things that woke me from the dream and when I talk in my sleep it means it's time for a vacation. There...hopefully tonight I will sleep like a baby!  Now, I am soon off to my Tuesday class, with that hunky Military Pilot as my teacher.... Hmmm, maybe he can keep the Boogie-man away!
