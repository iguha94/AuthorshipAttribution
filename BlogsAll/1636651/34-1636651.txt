         What has Halloween become?  Halloween is now over for all the little ones, the 8 o'clock curfew has come upon them.  I didn't have one child come to my door, which was fine.  I don't need to see the little rugrats dancing in front of me begging for a candy bar.  What gets me, is the ones that don't even try to dress up.  What is that all about?   I remember, even as a young teen, dressing in whatever I found in my dad's or brother's closets and going all out.  Trying to come up with the craziest costume anyone ever thought up.   These kids I saw walking the streets today didn't even try.  There were kids just in regular clothes and to be honest, they are the ones that scare me to most.  It totally freaks me out that a 14, 15 or 16 year old kid, will knock on my door, ask for candy or money or even my stereo and you know what?  I'd give it to them.  I am afraid that kid will come back and get me and do something to my car, or my house or even me.   Maybe I am just a scaredy-cat, but ya know what.  I will take a mob of Freddies and Jasons and I will even let Michael into my house.  But you knock on my door wearing a white T-shirt and black jeans and I will scream my head off! I am glad I kept my lights off....whew!
