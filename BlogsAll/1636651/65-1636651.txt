         My son asked to use my phone last night, so I tossed it to him and went back to chatting on the internet.  A few minutes later he comes back and hands me the phone.  I asked him if he was finished already and he said No, that I had a call and I might want to call him back.  I looked at him and asked who called.   The following is a somewhat accurate recant of what followed:   Son : Ummmmm, Mr. Fix-it called.  Me : What?!  What did he call for, did you answer it?  Son : Yes.  Me : Well? What did he want?  Son : I don't know.  When I said hello, I heard this deep growly voice kind of stammer and then he said, "Yo, is Leroy there? I'm looking for Leroy"  I said, This is Vixie's phone, you looking for Vixie?  And then he said, "No, don't know no Vixie, I am looking for Leroy."  Then I said, ok Mr. Fix it what ever you say and then he hung up on me.  Me : Leroy?!  What the fuck is his problem?  Ohhh my god, do I have to break up with him again?    And then I broke into hysterical laughter, tears were streaming down my face.  Son is looking at me like I lost it, but I didn't care.  The entire situation was just beyond belief.  Leroy....I don't look like no Leroy!
