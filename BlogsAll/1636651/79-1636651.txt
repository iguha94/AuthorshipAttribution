         I am tired! I am emotionally drained!  My son called me as my mom and I were leaving the VFW tonight with devastating news. Shadow was not well.  He told me that he was unresponsive and drooling and had defecated on himself.  Mom and I rushed to my house to find just that. Shadow was in a seizure as I arrived. In a panic, I called my sister, who was a Vet assistant in another life and she called the hospital as mom started the car as I rushed out with Shadow. He siezured all the way to the hospital, which put me in a state of hysteria.  Mom sped through town and got us to the hospital in record time.  By then, I had said good-bye to Shadow and he laid content on my chest as we ran into the office. The Vet scooped him up and rushed him away from me. The minutes were agonizing, waiting seemed to take forever. She gave him a shot of Valium and put in an IV and he was sleeping when she brought him back to me.  We went over his history as we waited for his blood work to come back and she asked me what I wished to do. She told me he was in Guarded condition and I would eventually have to make a discussion.  Mom told her to do what it took.  And then the Vet asked about if it came down to resuscitating him.   I told her "No, let him go if he wanted to go". She wrote something down and then looked up and told me to say good-night to him.  She was going to put him in a warming bed since his temp was down to 96.6 degrees.  And she wanted to start some Antibiotics. Just as I was leaving, she came out with the test results and she raised his condition to Serious.  It appears his body is in shock.  He is hypoglycemic. Though she said for me to not get all my hopes up, she did say that so far, he can be helped. My hopes are up, but I know deep down he will go.   Just not tonight.
