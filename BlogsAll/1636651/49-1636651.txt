         This week's   Cheddar X !   1. What's the funniest town name you've ever seen?  Being a military brat and living in a bizilion towns, a funny name doesn't really come to mind.  But when I tell people where I was born I usually get a few raised eyebrows.  I was born in Bourne, yup...and the hospital was torn down to make way for a National cemetery.     2. What was the last museum you went to?  Would Stone Mountain in Georgia count? No? Then it would have to be.....Ohhh my, Ummmm, I think the Museum of Modern Art in New York, gosh that would be like 20 years ago.  Sorry, I have been corrected, The Smithsonian in 1989   3. When was the last time you were grossed out?   It really takes alot to gross me out.  The worst I have ever seen was down in the French Quarter, Labor Day weekend 2002...ya'll know what happens then, and I won't go in a circle again!   4. What is the best blog title you've come across or made up on your own?  There are so many great blogs out there, it is too hard to choose just one.     5. Do you live in your hometown now? What caused you to stay or move away?  I don't live in my hometown anymore, mainly because I didn't feel like it was home anymore.  All of my family had either moved away or passed away.  As soon as my daughter graduated (and after asking her if she wanted to move, to which she said no) I sold what I could and moved south.  Better job opportunities, family closer, and I didn't have to see the ex's anymore, Yey!   6. If you were a criminal mastermind, how would you take over the world?  I would make everyone my sex slaves!  Bwahahahahahahaaaaaa! Seriously, if the chance to take over the world fell in my hands, people be afraid, I can't even balance my checkbook!
