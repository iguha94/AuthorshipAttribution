         I would like to apologize to my Peoples in advance.  More than likely I will not be bringing in the Krispie Kremie Goodness of donuts in the morning for all to enjoy.  I am very sad right now, as well as a bit sore.  You see, on my way home from work today, some stupid bitch rear-ended me.  She smooshed my bumper into my trunk and accordioned my trunk lid.  While she was at it she poked holes in my bumper with hooks that were on the front of her truck. After I was able to get my car off to the side of the road and I slowly emerged from my car, I started screaming at her for hitting me.  Several time I called her a "stupid f-ing Bitch".  Her calm response was, I hit your car, whats wrong with you.  This made me madder and of course I became hysterical. I calmed enough to call my dad, who came running to my aid and then I called the boyfriend, who also came running to my aid. She was overwhelmed by my posse'.   The police finally showed up and gave her a ticket, calmed me down and sent me on my way. Insurance company has been notified, but have to call them back in the morning to verify all that is covered.  I have medical if I need it, a rental car when my baby is in the shop, and whatever else I may need at my disposal.  Some may not like them, but I Love USAA. Now, as the Advil I took is starting to wear off, I feel very tight and sore in my lower back and my neck is throbbing so bad I feel a headache coming on.  I am still very angry and upset about the entire ordeal.  My car is my joy.  She is the first brand new car I have ever bought on my own.  She is only 10 months old.  And now she is a "Hooptie".
