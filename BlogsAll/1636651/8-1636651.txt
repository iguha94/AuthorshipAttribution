         The sun was out, the humidity was down and the bikes were beautiful.  Though the parking lot was full, the experience was a bit on the dull side.  It just seemed slow.  Top Hat showed, and though I had thought of many choice words to say to him, I kept them to myself.  He walked over to me and called me by my name, Hmmmmm?, and asked if I was still mad at him.  With my response as "Yes!", he graciously told me that that was fine, I had a right to be mad.  I thanked him for giving me permission and J and I slipped out unnoticed. "Legends" was the next stop, for dancing and scoping.  The band stikes up and it starts good, but then "Mandy" starts with her 80's top 40, and J and I groan.  It got worse as the band went on to play the "Electric Slide", we thought we had unknowingly joined a wedding reception. I was almost ready to bolt when out of the corner of our eyes we spotted two familiar faces, whooo hoo, it's "Starskey and Hutch" to the rescue (J and I work with these two guys, friends only).  We both ran over to them and gave them big hugs, welcome to our hell boys.  We whined to them about our evening, pointed out the losers and ended up sitting outside and talking.  The guys had to head out, Starskey to his wife and Hutch had to bring home his new treasures he purchased at "Bed, Bath and Beyond" (He, he, he), and I think we were debating whether or not to go ourselves when the band decided to actually play some decent music.  Well it's about time, we came to dance, gosh darn it!  On the floor we were, shakin our stuff, like two Hot women in heat, yup...that's what Harleyville is all about.
