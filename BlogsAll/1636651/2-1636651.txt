         My friend Popcorn took me to dinner last night at 22nd Street.   Steaks!  Yumm! It's been a long time since I had a steak dinner, hmmm, I think it was with Popcorn, I am seeing a pattern here.  Dinner was great and the conversation, well....let's just say you have to know Popcorn. Popcorn is old enough to be my Grandfather, I think, he won't tell me his age, and Popcorn has a crush on me.  This crush is fine, as long as he remembers he is just my friend, nothing more, we already had this conversation.  So we are sitting there, talking and this very handsome guy walks up to Popcorn and they start talking.  I am looking at this guy and he glances at me, and Wow....nice eyes, nice hair, nice everything... I think my mouth was hanging open and I may have been drooling, but I waited patiently for an intro and none came.  The guy left and I asked Popcorn why he didn't introduce me.  He said, "well, you are my date and I am not giving you up until I am ready."   Whooa, cowboy!   He then laughed it off, like he was teasing me.....I think we are going to have to have that talk again. Shortly thereafter, I was heading home...totally talked out, but a full tummy.   I think it will be awhile before I go to dinner with Popcorn again....but I might stop by the Grill again, maybe.
