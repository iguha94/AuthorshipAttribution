         This past week has been full of ups and downs...mostly downs. Ya see, I suffer from PMS, a form of depression.   I have had it since the beginning of time.  Some months it doesn't faze me and some are so bad I can't get out of bed, this month was close to the stay in bed kind. I have been to therapist's, taken medication(from Anti-depressants to Birth Control pills), support groups and even just suffered with it.    My second husband used the excuse that he couldn't make me happy that's why he left me for another woman.  John would call me the "Prozac Queen" when we would get in a fight.  Do the little hand wave and tell me to run along and call my "Shrink".  Loving support, huh? That's ok...he is working on wife number four, smokes too much, gets drunk every night and has to sleep with someone that has no tits. (Meoow!!)  Where did that Catty-Bitch come from?.....Ok, back on track here....PMS..  This week, I have gone from happy, smiling, beautiful woman one minute to weeping, moping, sad little girl the next.  It is a crazy messed up time, even I don't want to be me.  It's almost over though, I see the sunshine through the clouds as they say.  Bare with me, accept me and love me, that's all I ask.  That simple.  This too shall pass.
