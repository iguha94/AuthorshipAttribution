         Ahhh, the weekend is over.   And a busy weekend it was. Friday's Pre-Christening bash, the Christening on Saturday and the reception after, were all a good time.  As soon as I could, I was out of the dress and heels and into the shorts and tank, heading to the FQ. I ended up having dinner by myself, because nobody could make up their mind, but met up with the gang after.  The Zoo and BBC were the happening spots, I even made it to   "my favorite store"  for some shopping and I spent way too much money. As usual the evening ended too quick, all had drunk their fill and the party broke up. I was on my way out to find me a cab when I bumped into an old friend.  There had been some heat that had passed between us on our other meetings and when I saw the look in his eye I knew there would be more than just heat that night.  We talked for awhile and we went to his place....and ohhh it was awesome.  I even got a backrub.  It was almost dawn and I needed to sleep, so I rolled over and dozed, I was on my side and about an hour later I woke up and I saw him staring at the ceiling...the stare of doom.   I know this stare, I do it too, but I usually have the pillow over my head and lose myself in   "Pillow Thoughts".    There are thoughts going through your mind when you are in this situation.  I rolled over and put the pillow over my head, this is not a good thing. My first thought was, if he touches me, it means it's ok and I was mistaken, but he didn't, so I was right.  Instead he got up and took a shower.   Now I am not one to wallow in self-pity, and pout that something didn't go right.  I just wish if a man makes a mistake...he admits it.  I admit, we should not have gone there, we were friends, and we probably won't be anymore (which is sad), we were two lonely people that had needs and we satified them.  Big deal...get over yourself!
