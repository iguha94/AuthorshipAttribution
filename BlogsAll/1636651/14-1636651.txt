         I know I probably shouldn't have, but I IMed the man from this past weekend.  A closure thing, the need to know if I did something wrong, was I used, etc. I didn't get all the answers, but I know I was used, lied to...and it didn't have to be that way.    The following is an edited version of the IM I had with him(his name has been changed):  Vixie (9:44:08 AM): Hi, How are you? Did you enjoy the rest of your Vacation? thegentleman (9:45:39 AM): yeah it was ok thegentleman (9:45:39 AM): just slept Vixie (9:46:13 AM): Yeah...I guess it was needed Vixie (9:47:41 AM): I had a really nice time...Thank you Vixie (9:48:42 AM): I enjoyed your company thegentleman (9:49:36 AM): yeah it was fun thegentleman (9:49:41 AM): although I'm not too big a fan of NO Vixie (9:50:29 AM): Yeah..that was obvious thegentleman (9:51:02 AM): I don't know when I vacation thegentleman (9:51:08 AM): I prefer being in less populated areas thegentleman (9:51:19 AM): not to mention crime and piss ridden Vixie (9:52:30 AM): less people and craziness is a good thing thegentleman (9:53:31 AM): yep Vixie (9:57:33 AM): well, I got to get back to work.....by the way, I am not sure what I did to make you want me to leave on Sunday...but I would have appreciated a call... thegentleman (9:59:52 AM): life's a bitch Vixie (10:04:14 AM): Wow....Thanks....Hope you have a nice life, Sir...and thanks again for teaching me a lesson...don't let your guard down, and nobody will hurt you...Good-bye  Apparently, his idea of a gentleman and mine are different.   I genuinely hope he finds that "One"...and I hope she rips his heart out and stomps on his balls(Keith's idea on the balls) and makes him bleed!  I feel much better now!  Next!!
