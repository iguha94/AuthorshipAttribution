         I can't wait for the rest of this month to be over.  I am so busy the next two weeks, I am having trouble trying to think.  And I really need to think.  Everytime I believe I have figured out my problem and decide to remedy it, something else walks into it.    Ray came back in the picture.  We finally did go for a ride on his bike and I was right about how good it was going to feel.  I felt like I fit so nicely up against his back, it was warm and cozy and good.  After the ride, he followed me home and we sat in my car and talked for about an hour.   Of course with the occasional break to make-out like teenagers.   And then something clicked in my brain and I asked him how long he's been married.  He gave me that coy look, and then with a sigh of resignation he admitted he has a wife.   One of 22 years.  Fuckin great!  That definitely put a close to the evening.   I told him to call me, because I wanted to talk about it.  I need to talk about it.   I have known this man for a year and he has never, ever mentioned a wife.  He talked about his son, his father....but never his wife and I want to know why.  And I seriously doubt it was because he had designs on me, we have known each other a year.  And he knows how I feel about married men. So we will talk.  He called me and we are going to lunch on Monday, it would be sooner, but he has tournaments all weekend and he will be out of town.  He will explain and then I will tell him I can't. Gawd, I am so glad I didn't sleep with him.  SO this weekend will be busy for me and the time will pass too quick.  The VFW is having their Craft Fair tomorrow and then Sunday is the Irish/Italian Parade.  Lots to do and no time to complete it.  Hoping Monday comes quick so I can get some rest.
