         I was asked the question, "What's the difference between Swapping and Swinging?"  Good question.  Swapping is when two couples switch partners with each other.  Most times when you find a couple that you like you don't stray from them, you end up having a 4 way relationship.  If this works, it is wonderful, but sometimes, like in many relationships, communication breaks down and disaster happens.  Swinging is usually a group of people swapping.  Almost like a club, ok it is a club.  It is mostly couples, with some singles, the majority of singles are women and most of those women are bisexual.  The swingers clubs will meet (Party) at a home or hotel once or twice a month, eat, drink and literally pick up someone - One on one, couples, same sex (women), and there is always a common (orgy) room.  These types of gatherings are not for the timid or jealous types.  You have to know the game and you have to love the game.  Plain and simple, it's just sex for pleasure.  If you can't handle it, don't dabble in it, it not a forgiving game, it will scar you, I have seen the damage. The most important person at these "Parties" is the Host or Hostess {curtsey}, He/She is responsible for organizing the party and making sure all are happy.  He/She is greatly rewarded for their generosity, many, many times over.
