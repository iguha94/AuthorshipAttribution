          Effectiveness Tip of the Week   from a weekly email I receive from the folks at   FranklinCovey     First... some relevant quotes, from   QuotesBlog  :  "Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. As you simplify your life, the laws of the universe will be simpler." --   Henry David Thoreau  "Awaken your sense, your intuition, your desires. Awaken the parts of yourself that have been sleeping. Life is a dream, and to live it, you must be awake." --   Rachel Snyder  "True life is lived when tiny changes occur." --   Leo Tolstoy     Mission Possible   Ever feel like a double agent, living one life and dreaming of another?  Be the leader of your life!  Sound impossible?  It's not, when you have a Personal Mission Statement.  Here are some clues:   Unique : It's different for everyone.  It can be a sentence, paragraph or poem.  Focus :  It's a clear guide based on your values -- what you want to be and do.  Ask yourself this question:  "What can I imagine myself doing if time and money were not obstacles?"  Passion :  It's what excites you most in the world and lifts you up on your soapbox. Take 5 minutes RIGHT NOW and write as much as you can about your personal mission in life.  It doesn't have to be perfect.  You can revise this first draft later.  Keep it in your planning device and read it morning and evening for the next week.  Decide what things you can do during the day to live your mission.  (Warning!
