A Dream About to Come True    I recently received this email from ME and KE, who are   adopting a baby girl from China .   "Family and Friends:  "Today we received our referral paperwork from China.  This is the paperwork we've waited 13 months to receive!  We don't have the exact dates that the four of us will travel to China to pick up Kira.......although we will probably depart around the 2nd week of June.  (We'll spend 12 days  in China, picking her up on the first  day we are there).  "She is 11 months old.....weighs 16 pounds and is 25 inches long.....her date of birth is 5/24/01  (Kathy shares her birthday :0).  "She is presently living in foster care in the Nanchaang Scoial Welfare Institute located in the Jiangxi Province of China.      "Her birth name is Hong Yuan Hui.  (We'll use part or all??? of her birthname as her middle name).  "Her personality is described as:  active, restless, having a ready smile, gets along well with ohers, quick in reaction, energetic, fairly extroberted, obstinate sometimes, and impatient sometimes(We think she'll fit right in!)  "Hopefully this answers most of your questions, if you have others, PLEASE feel free to ask!  "Also, if you know of someone who may be interested in our news and you do not see them on the recipient list of this e mail, please feel free to pass it along.  "Thank you for  all your support and prayers!  We're so glad to be able to share this exciting time with you!"
