What good is a blood donor?    Yesterday I had the privilege to hear a representative from our Community Blood Center here in Dayton, Ohio.  She handed out a flyer with the following text on it:   A blood donor is good for people who go through windshields and red lights.  For  Someone with cancer, hemophilia, or anemia.  Or hepatitis.  Or ulcers.   For  people being operated on.   For  people into feudin' and fightin'.    For  people who are almost out of life because they are almost out of blood.   For  a little girl who doesn't know that leukemia has happened to her.  Or why.   For  a little boy who needs something revved up that wound down.  Like energy.   For  people having open-heart surgery.   For  people who need a blood donor and also an organ donor -- a part as well as a pint -- a new heart or new liver, a lung or a kidney.   For  new babies needing new blood.  Or new mothers needing a transfusion.   For  little kids who get into something poison or fall onto something sharp.   For  people who fool around with something that explodes, goes off, bites or shatters.   For  people burned pretty bad.   For  daredevils.  Tree climbers.   For  people at the wrong place at the wrong time.  A blood donor is good for people who are in a lot worse shape than most people you know.  Someone needs a lot of your blood a lot.  ---------- What are  your  reasons for not being a regular blood donor?  I will be eligible to donate again the first or second week in October.
