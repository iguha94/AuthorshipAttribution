Having a Birthday (or Godly Sorrow vs. Worldly Sorrow)   Today I had a birthday.  No, not the annual kind to celebrate when I've added another year to my life.  More like a rebirth of sorts.  It was forced on me somewhat.  I had not been spending my time wisely while at work, and it was showing.  I would make excuses for why progress wasn't where it should be, but really I was just horsing around, not getting the work done.  I've had an improper work ethic.  Today it came to a head when I was given a sharp rebuke from two of my team members.  The other one was out today, but he probably could have chimed in just as much.  I was presented with an ultimatum, so to speak.  Needless to say, that got my attention.  So, I begin anew, with an improved work ethic.  I am also needing to be aware of what's going on around me.  Even if others aren't seeing what I'm doing, I know that God sees, and his opinion is what ultimately matters.  The true sign of a person's integrity is who they are when no one else is around.  I haven't been a man of integrity, that's for sure.  But I can and will keep changing.  I really want to do it for God, but I know I'll be tempted to do it to please men.  I have been reminded of this passage about godly sorrow vs. worldly sorrow:    2 Cor. 7:10-11
