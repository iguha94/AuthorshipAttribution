Stay-at-Home Dad   Since Jennie has been working during the day for the past four weeks and recently picked up another job in the evenings, I've become somewhat of a stay-at-home Dad.  It's different in a good way.  I get to take Keisha to her weekly speech therapy appointments.  We get to hang out together and do fun stuff like go to the library, stop by the UDF (United Dairy Farmers) near the   University of Dayton  for a soda.  We did all three yesterday (Friday).  At 8:30 AM we dropped Jennie off   at work  and then stopped by the   UDF on Brown Street  because we were thirsty.  We noticed that they had 3 Krispy Kreme donuts for $1.79, so we bought some.  After we sat down, Keisha and I began eating our donuts, and I brought out my Bible and told Keisha that we were going to read something from it together.  I found the   Parable of the Lost Sheep .  Then we did our memory verse from this past Tuesday night's Family Devotional,   Psalm 37:4 .  After this we drove to the clinic to see if my medicine was available for me to pick up.  No dice.  Then we drove to   Children's Medical Center , where Keisha has her speech therapy.  She did really well - picking up a lot of vocabulary.  Then we drove to the   Dayton and Montgomery County Public Library  to check out some videos and some CDs.  We also got some books for Keisha to read.  They have an entire shelf in the Children's book area devoted to new readers.  Cool!  We checked out   Raffi 's   Singable Songs Collection , which we all love!  She's actually been listening to Raffi since she was a couple months old and I'd sing her the songs from the   Singable Songs for the Very Young  album.            &nbsp;    The Singable Songs Collection   20th Anniversary Special Edition 3 Albums: Singable Songs for the Very Young, More Singable Songs for the Very Young and Corner Grocery Store    1996   &nbsp;            Singable Songs for the Very Young 1976
