Tooth Extraction   I was talking with a coworker this morning who is considering having his wisdom teeth taken out.  We've told him about our experiences, and he's a little apprehensive, not wanting it to be a horror story himself.  I got all four of my wisdom teeth taken out at once.  Before going to the oral surgeon's office, I ate some hot and spicy buffalo wings, since I knew that I wouldn't be able to eat them for awhile.  I didn't have insurance coverage (college boy supporting self fortunately had $ from co-op job and student loans), so I had to pay out of pocket.  Fortunately, I had waited until all four of them had erupted.  All the surgeon had to do was extract them; no cutting necessary.  Only local anesthesia (novocaine?) on the jaw.  So there I was.  Wide awake, yet feeling no pain... for now.  The surgeon pulled three of them out.  The last one was harder.  I remember him yanking my jaw back and forth ("Gee, you're really making me   work   for this one!" said the man getting paid over $100 per tooth.).  That hurt a little.  After it was all finished, I contacted my roommates, who picked me up.  Eager to get home, I climbed in the back seat.  Jorge, one of my roommates, wanted to check on his job application at University Hospital, so we stopped there.  What was meant to be a very quick wait wound up lasting over a half hour.  By this time I was hurting big time, and    very    eager to get home and rest.  So when that time finally arrived, I went upstairs and lay down in bed.  Some time later the phone rang.  It was Lindsey Nelson, a friend from church who was in Medical School at UC (i.e., University of Cincinnati).  "What's up?" he asked.  "I'm in pain.  I just had my wisdom teeth taken out." I muffled with my mouth full of cotton.  "Would you like a shake?" he asked. "Sure." I replied.  I hung up and went back to sleep.  Sometime later Lindsey shows up with a 32-oz homemade chocolate shake.  Now,   that   was encouraging!
