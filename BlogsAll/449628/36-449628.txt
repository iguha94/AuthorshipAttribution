           "I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up."    I made that statement yesterday at a gathering of other job seekers at   Sinclair Community College .  A brief history of my education and experience:  I have a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering I was an Environmental Engineer doing environmental management for a manufacturing company I was a programmer/consultant I am a bartender for a hotel and conference center I remember when I met with the guidance counselor in high school, he told me that he could see me doing a number of different kinds of jobs, based on the talents and aptitude he'd seen in me.  I had dreamed of becoming a Renaissance Man back then.  I don't know if I've found something that fits just yet.  To quote   U2 , "I still haven't found what I'm looking for."  At the same time, I realize that no job is going to be a perfect fit.  There are always going to be times when the passion wanes, when there is other "non-fun" work to be done, too.  I guess it's a matter of seeing whether the benefits outweigh the costs, evaluating the trade-offs.  For example, I have a friend who designs cars for a major automobile company.  He loves that part of his job so much that he is able to live with the long hours and the long drive to and from work.  I guess I want to find something in-between, too.    crossposted to   Journey Inside My Mind
