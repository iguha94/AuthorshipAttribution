          Seasonal Employment, Part 1   We've been slowly unpacking the rest of our stuff.  I say 'we', but I really mean my wife Jennie.  One of the items she found is fond reminder of a job I had at Christmastime while in college.  A clipping from the December 24, 1993 front page of the Cincinnati Enquirer contains a photo of me.  The caption under the photo reads as follows: Dan Johnson, Jr., a senior at the University of Cincinnati, helps Logan Abner, 2, put money into the [Salvation Army] kettle at the Madeira Kroger store Thursday.  Johnson plays the saxophone to lure donations. The photo was taken by Glenn Hartong, and it shows me bundled up, wearing a Santa cap, with my alto saxophone hanging from my neck, helping Logan put his coins into the kettle.  I remember that job fondly.  I needed it to have money for rent and stuff.  The folks at the Madeira Kroger warmly welcomed my music.  Every so often, as I would get cold, I'd go inside for a break.  The crew of cashiers would ask me to play "O Holy Night" for them.  I did, and everyone applauded.  I was grateful to be able to cheer them up.  I also recall being encouraged by one of my friends' mom.  I actually knew her because she took a class with me in college.  She lived in Madeira, and once, on her way out of the store, she handed me a cookie and cup of hot chocolate.  How very thoughtful!  I read in this past Sunday's classifieds that the Salvation Army is looking for talented musicians to man their kettles again this year.  It something to consider.    crossposted to   Journey Inside My Mind
