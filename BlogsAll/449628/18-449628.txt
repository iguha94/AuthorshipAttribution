          More Publicity Deserves Reciprocation   I'm at the library, checking email and going through the referral logs, all during my one-hour allotted timeframe.  Our home PC is still being serviced, so I have to blog at the library in the meantime.  I'm also working as a bartender, which you may be aware of from the archives.  I bring this up so that you can understand why there may be a long lapse in blogging.  I've been checking the referrer log, and the statistics are higher than ever! :)  I'd like to give a welcome to those of you visiting from   Monster.com's Vent page .  I'd also like to say thanks to Scott over at   JobSeekersAdvice.com ,   for his encouraging words .  Specifically: Anyone know of decent blogs out there?

Here are a couple I´d recommend:    Get that Job   Where I found this Wired article about   fake job postings .  Another for the web designers out there is   Debra Paynter's Promotional Strategy Blog  - a frank look at web promotion strategies.  Anyone else got a few to add? (they dont have to be career related! Thanks, Scott, and you've been added to the Blogroll!
