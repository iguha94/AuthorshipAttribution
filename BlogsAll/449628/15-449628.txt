          The Balancing Act   Compared to 25 years ago, the typical family puts in 1,000 more hours a year at work and more than 8 million of us work two or more jobs.  So it's no wonder that finding a balance between work and life is difficult.  But balance is essential to our well-being and our ability to perform well at home and at work.  Here are five ways to get a better footing:   Simplify.   Need help with housecleaning?  Consider hiring a cleaning person once a week.  Feel like you don't have time?  Say "no" to things you don't want to do or don't have time to do.  Be grateful. Even in the midst of the most hectic and stressful times of life, there are things for which we can be thankful.  Reflecting on the good things in our lives helps keep an all-important balance in our outlook.  Be a kid and play.   Get down in the dirt and help the kids make mud pies, watch a movie with them, or have a long chat over coffee with your teen.  Give your family one-on-one time.  Pay attention to yourself.   If you don't stay healthy, you'll be less able to handle the stress of work and home.  Stop procrastinating.   It takes more energy fretting over not doing a project than actually doing it.  So save your energy for better things and just get started.     Source: Ragan Communications
