          Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at   FranklinCovey     Push Pause   You’ve put in 8+ hours at the office; attended a PTA meeting, soccer practice, and/or a doctor’s appointment; and now you’re in the midst of helping with homework, feeding the dog, and clearing out the answering machine.  It’s high time for a time-out.  A walk?  A movie?  Now—before you scoff at the notion and claim it would take a sheer miracle to find extra time for that time-out, realize that it is well worth it.  Taking a moment to yourself reduces stress and leaves you refreshed and focused, not irritable and distracted.  You’ll feel better and have a fresh outlook to tackle all the tasks that are waiting for you.  A few tips:  Your time-out doesn’t have to be something big. Sit on the porch and enjoy a lemonade, take a small hike, or lounge on the couch with a magazine. If evenings are hectic, try waking up 30 minutes earlier to soak in the tub, walk the dog, or savor a warm drink. Do not get distracted. If your family is around, tell them they’re in charge of answering the door, the phone, and that, unless it’s an emergency, you’re off duty for a few minutes.   Pushing pause for a personal time-out—rewind and try it again!
