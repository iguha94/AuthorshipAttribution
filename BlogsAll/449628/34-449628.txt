          5 Things to do with all that extra time:    Being unemployed may suck financially, but it does have its advantages in terms of all of that extra free time it creates.  You could spend the next couple of months couch surfing, or here are some other things you can do with your free time:  1.   Learn to Cook  - there are cooking classes, cookbooks, and my personal favorite, the   food network  with all sorts of cooking shows like   Iron Chef ,   30 Minute Meals ,   Food 911 ,   Date Plate  , and   the Naked Chef with Jamie Oliver (why is it they pick the hunkiest hosts for these shows?  Cute men that can actually cook?  Woohoo!), you're bound to find something that appeals to your "inner chef"!  2.   Exercise Your Body : you don't have to join a gym to get out and get some exercise!  Pick your favorite activity, or something that you've always wanted to learn, and get on a schedule, joing a group, or take a class to improve your skills.  3.   Exercise Your Mind : Learn something new, take a class, read a book, get certified, write your memoirs, anything is good as longs as it exercises your mind! 4.   Get Organized ! Whether it's   organizing your house ,   your life  or your   job search , it's never too late to make a fresh start at getting organized (and staying that way!)  5.   Volunteer   If you have any other suggestions for this list, please add a comment!  (cross-posted on the   Job Files )
