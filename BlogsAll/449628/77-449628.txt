Sleep Study   Last Friday, Jen, who blogs to Thinking by Smell,   wrote about being in a sleep study .  That's interesting.  I was part of a sleep study over ten years ago when I lived in the Detroit, Michigan area.  The researchers were testing to see how drowsy a person taking Benadryl gets.  The first week was going to be a baseline test (i.e., a control test)  I was told that I could not take in any caffeine or chocolate 12 hours before I was to go in.  They should have just put me in jail or something.  I went in at the approved time and also went to a "hook up" room.  Shortly after they turned off the lights, I was out.  They woke me up in the morning, and boy, did I feel wasted.  They let me eat breakfast, but I was not to drink any caffeine still.  After the breakfast break, I went to a computer terminal and had to take this manual dexterity test.  I was supposed to get a perfect score, considering I hadn't been given any of the Benadryl.  But because I was still so sleepy, every cell in my body begging for rest, I didn't get a good score.  Later that week, I received a check in the mail and was told that they would not need me any more for the current sleep study.  I know it was because I was a poor control guinea pig.  I've considered participating in additional studies because participants get paid.  Maybe soon...
