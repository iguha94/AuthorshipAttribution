          Effectiveness Tip of the Week   via email from the folks at   FranklinCovey     On the Road Again   Whoops, I think we took the wrong road.  I turn left, right?  Where is your roadmap to your destiny in life taking you?  Take some time out to seriously identify what really matters most in your life and what you really want to be and do.  To really begin your journey with the end in mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination.  It means to know where you're going so you better understand where you are now so that the steps you take are always in the right direction.   Find your passion.   What do you care about most?  Allow your passion to take more priority in life.  Follow the big picture of your life.   Allocate your time more efficiently and don't waste time on things that aren't important to the big picture.  Spell out to yourself a dream version of your passion.   How does it feel?  What does it look like?  Where would it take you?  Get a move on.   Don't wait until a better time to move toward what you want.  There is no better time.  The time is now.  Stay open to changes.   Just because things aren't going exactly to plan doesn't mean they are not in alignment.  Trust the process.
