Pet Peeve -- Ohio Bicentennial License Plates   Ohio will be celebrating its bicentennial in 2003.  Last September, Ohio began issuing Bicentennial license plates to help commemorate the occasion.  They have red, white, and blue on them, which also makes it patriotic.  These license plates have been a hit, especially considering the renewed patriotism in America.  The designers of this license plate have had to make some changes in the layout to accomodate the additional information.  One of these changes is the county where the license plate holder lives.  (Growing up, our family would often travel from Cincinnati to Toledo where my dad grew up.  One of the ways we'd pass the time is to notice the license plates of the cars around us.  We'd be interested in those from out of state and those from Canada (Ontario), and we'd also notice the different Ohio counties represented.  This tradition is something we still whenever we drive.  It was easy to note which cars are from which county because it was spelled out on the bottom center of the license plate.)  The Ohio Bicentennial license plate now has a small square county sticker with a number corresponding to the alphabetical order of the county in the list of all 88 counties.  For example, I live in Dayton, Ohio, which is in Montgomery county.  In the alphabetical list Montgomery is the 57th county.  I often travel to Cincinnati and back, so I pass through Warren (83), Butler (09), and Hamilton (31).  Now, below this large number is the name of the county, but it is in very small letters.  These numbers are fine and dandy if you've memorized the alphabetical list of the counties.  But who in Ohio has done that?  My guess is that very few, if any, know them all by memory.  (Actually, this was something we had to memorize when I was studying Ohio history in junior high school.  At the time, I didn't think I would need to remember.)  My fellow Ohioans don't appreciate me tailgating them to see which county they are from.  So, what am I to do?  Well, I have compiled the alphabetical list for me personally, and for whomever else is interested.  So here goes:                      01      ADAMS      45      LICKING            02      ALLEN      46      LOGAN            03      ASHLAND      47      LORAIN            04      ASHTABULA      48      LUCAS            05      ATHENS      49      MADISON           06      AUGLAIZE      50      MAHONING            07      BELMONT      51      MARION            08      BROWN      52      MEDINA            09      BUTLER      53      MEIGS            10      CARROLL      54      MERCER            11      CHAMPAIGN      55      MIAMI            12      CLARK      56      MONROE            13      CLERMONT      57      MONTGOMERY            14      CLINTON      58      MORGAN            15      COLUMBIANA      59      MORROW            16      COSHOCTON      60      MUSKINGUM            17      CRAWFORD      61      NOBLE            18      CUYAHOGA      62      OTTAWA            19      DARKE      63      PAULDING            20      DEFIANCE      64      PERRY            21      DELAWARE      65      PICAWAY            22      ERIE      66      PIKE            23      FAIRFIELD      67      PORTAGE            24      FAYETTE      68      PREBLE            25      FRANKLIN      69      PUTNAM            26      FULTON      70      RICHLAND            27      GALLIA      71      ROSS            28      GEAUGA      72      SANDUSKY            29      GREENE      73      SCIOTO            30      GUERNSEY      74      SENECA            31      HAMILTON      75      SHELBY            32      HANCOCK      76      STARK            33      HARDIN      77   SUMMIT            34      HARRISON      78      TRUMBULL            35      HENRY      79      TUSCARAWAS            36      HIGHLAND      80      UNION            37      HOCKING      81      VAN WERT            38      HOLMES      82      VINTON            39      HURON      83      WARREN            40      JACKSON      84      WASHINGTON            41      JEFFERSON      85      WAYNE            42      KNOX      86      WILLIAMS            43      LAKE      87      WOOD            44      LAWRENCE      88      WYANDOT
