A Run For My Life   I had a very strange dream last night.  Some other people (friends?) and I were being chased through a multi-story building with a parking lot by a psychopath.  It also took place at a park nearby.  The dream seemed like it lasted about an hour, as though it could have been an episode of a TV drama.  As these things often are, unfortunately the details are now fuzzy.  Below are some things that I can remember, though:  - The chase mostly occurred on the elevators - We knew that a friend of ours, TM, was on his way into work.  He had parked on the 9-1/2th floor.  We tried for as long as possible to keep the elevator from stopping there because we knew that TM was unaware of the danger before him. - To make the elevator stop at the 9-1/2 floor, you had to press the buttons for the 9th and 10th floors and stop the elevator in between.  I remember something like this being done in the movie "  Being John Malchovich ". - Just as soon as we thought things were getting back to normal, this guy - the psychopath - would flip out again and resume chasing us. - Indeed we felt like we were almost always on the run for our lives. - Eventually we thought it was safe enough to get TM from the 9-1/2th floor, but as soon as we stopped there, we realized that the psycho has become aware of the existence of the 9-1/2 floor.  We had somehow thought that it was a "safe haven" - until then. - Unfortunately we couldn't help our friend TM.  By the time we arrived at the 9-1/2th floor, the psychopath had already got to him.
