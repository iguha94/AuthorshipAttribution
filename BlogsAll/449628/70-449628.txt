Email Virus Hoax   from work email   "There are e-mails that are bombarding our system today about the alleged   jdbgmgr.exe virus  .  " THIS IS A HOAX .  This is exactly the same type of message for the   sulfnbx.exe 'virus'   that circulated our systems about a month ago.   It tries to persuade you to delete a file they claim is a virus...however, it is a legitimate Windows file from your computer.   "The file that the [current] hoax refers to,   Jdbgmgr.exe  , is a   Java Debugger Manager  . It is a Microsoft file that is installed when you install Windows.  "It does have a teddy bear icon as described in the hoax.  While this is, in an of itself, NOT a virus, if you delete the file, it has the same effect as a virus... it messes up your system.  "You may want to emphasize to anyone who sends these to you, that when a virus is real and is supposed to do the damage this message implies, there will be major news coverage (e.g. the I Love You virus)....[we] will send warnings and they will get the information from legit sources... not just 'a friend'.  "Also, before they e-mail this type of thing, stongly encourage them check with the   Symantec  or   McAfee  web sites.  Both of those sites are free and have information on hoaxes and real virus messages that are in the system.  "Hope this helps...." --- end of message ---  I also   recommend this page .
