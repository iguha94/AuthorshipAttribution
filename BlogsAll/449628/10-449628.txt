         I received this letter from the director of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services a few weeks ago.  It states as follows: Dear Customer:  In an effort to serve customers in a more efficient manner, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS) is streamlining unemployment compensation claims processing, as well as changing employment service delivery methods.  Effective Friday, May 2, 2003, at 5 P.M. the ODJFS office located at 1111 Edwin C. Moses Blvd. in Dayton will become the Dayton Processing Center.  Please note that your unemployment compensation file will not be relocated as a result of this change, [sic] however, the ability to register in person for unemployment compensation will no longer be available.  To file a new or bi-weekly claim for benefits, inquire about the status of an existing claim, or obtain information about a previous claim, please call  1-877-OHIO-JOB (644-6562) .  This toll free telephone number can also be used to restart unemployment compensation benefits after a period of not claiming benefits.  In order to access some options within the telephone system, a personal identification number (PIN) is required.  If you have not received a letter providing you with an 8-digit PIN, or it you need additional information, please call 1-888-582-0133.  ODJFS has joined forces with other employment and training partners in your area to ensure that in-person assistance is provided to those seeking employment opportunities, such as job referrals, training, and veteran's services at The Job Center located at 1111 Edwin C. Moses Blvd., Dayton, Ohio 45401-1822.   Please note that specific information related to umemployment compensation claims will not be provided by ODJFS staff in this location.
