          Staying Employed While You're Searching for a New Job  Everyone knows it's easier to find a job when you already have one.  So, even if your job is a miserable one, plog away as long as you can while you're looking for something better.  Be smart about how you go about looking for a job, unless you really just don't care whether or not your current employer finds out.  1. If you are searching for jobs on the Internet from your work computer, do yourself a favor and keep your activities private by using a free proxy service like   The Cloak .  2. Don't use your work email account to send resumes from (I know this sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how many people do this!), and if you must give out a daytime number, use a cell phone or answering service. 3. Posting your resume online can be tricky, if you don't want your current employer to pull you up in a candidate search.  It's much better to not post your resume publicly, and also be careful about sending in resumes to anonymous employers (yes, I've heard of people sending in resumes for their own jobs - it's not pretty!) 4. Track your job search using portable media, like   Jobfiler , or a notebook you can carry with you.  That way you don't have records on your work computer which indicate you've been searching. 5. Whatever else you do, don't publicly broadcast your job search in a Blog or Discussion Board posts, unless you are fully prepared for the consequences. People have been fired over less.  Good luck with your job search!
