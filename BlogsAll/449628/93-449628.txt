Reflections on the Blogging Experience, So Far   I am forming an opinion about blogging, based on my experience with it so far.  Maybe your comments will help me.  Now, I cannot guarantee that anything I type henceforth in this post will be grammatically correct or will even make any sense at all.  Get ready for some stream-of-consciousness:  It seems that those blogs centered around a particular theme get more traffic.  I am talking about those blogs that are about technology, cooking,   help with blogger's block , creative writing,   quotations ,   job hunting , and so on.  Someone who wants to read about technology has a better chance of finding something in a blog that is more techology-based, for example.  Yet I also find it useful to read blogs that tend to be of a more personal nature.  For example, I may never get to meet   Mike Zellers  in person (although I'd like to, someday), but I can discern a lot about him from reading his blog.  I recently created a weblog about the job hunting process, called "Get That Job!".  I have set it up so that other people can contribute content.  Actually, I am eager for others to sign up as regular contributors or occasional contributors. So let me know if you are interested!  The links to writing posts, etc., are getting dusty, and I am considering creating another blog for just my own creative writing and moving the creative writing posts from this blog to the new one.  What do you think?
