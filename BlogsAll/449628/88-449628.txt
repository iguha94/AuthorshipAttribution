I received this via email a long time ago. - DAJ    The intent of this song is that it's GOD who's saying the words.  I hope this can encourage brothers and sisters who need to be reminded that God is always behind us, believing in us, not pointing the finger ready to zap us.    I Believe In You  (C) 1993 Eric Smith  I was with you, from the very start I was close to you, you near to me, always in my heart So many times I counted, your troubles my very own --  I shared your tears; did you realize, you never were alone          Did you hear my voice, when I called?         How I long to hear your laughter         And spend the days with you --          Now and forever after -- hear my voice, hear it true...             I Believe In You  Time ever fleeting, we watched the years pass You always hoping for one better than the last How I longed for you to call me, how I've wanted you so near And I waited so patiently, as you gave into your fears          Do you hear my voice, when I call?         How long to see your spirit soar         And spend the days with you -         Now and forever more -- hear my voice, hear it true...             I Still Believe In You  And then by no mistake, well that day it finally came Like cool refreshing water, I heard you calling on my name And then it seemed like only moments, that we'd ever been apart Now laughing just like children, and dreaming with one heart!          Well you heard my voice when I called         It's so good to hear your laughter         And spend the days with you --       	   Now and forever after -- hear my voice, hear it true --              I Believe In You -- yeah, hear my voice, hear it true --                      I've Always Believed  --   In    --   You.
