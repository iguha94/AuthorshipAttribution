          Job Hunting Success Story   Sue T. responded to   a recent post  and shared her job hunting success story: Cheers !!!   I finally got a job!!   I got my job through a website called   www.jobs.net .   I was doing my daily job search at my local workforce one in Florida, and I stumbled across this website, which I'd never heard of before. I decided to check this site out, and I found a position called yacht finance specialist (a.k.a administrative assistant). The funny thing about this position was it posted on August 18, 2003, and it was still on their site on November 12, 2003. I called the employer, and the reason why they did not find anyone was because none of the other candidates had passed the credit check. The company is owned by a bank, and passing a credit check is required.  In the post to which Sue responded, we posed some specific questions.  Below we've listed the questions along with her answers.   What position were you applying for?  Administrative Assistant  How did you contact the particular company?  I called the company and then faxed them my resume  Describe the interviewing process.  It was pretty simple.  They were only interested in me because they had already posted this position on   careerbuilder.com  and had not yet found anyone qualified for it.  Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired?  No  How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work?  I interviewed for the position on November 18th.  I returned on December 1st and was hired after I found out I passed the credit check.  Describe your emotional state during the process. Were you anxious? Excited? Stressed? Impatient? Frustrated? Let us know.  I kept wondering why the credit check was taking so long.
