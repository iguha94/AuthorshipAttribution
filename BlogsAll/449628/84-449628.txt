Baring My Soul, Part 2 - 15 Minutes (Or More) Of Fame     Dan Johnson (who's that?) asks , "Have you ever been on television or in the newspaper?  More than once?  What for?"     As a child I was on "  The Uncle Al Show ," a local kids television show in Cincinnati.  This past Christmas, Jennie, Keisha, and I were on the local news in Dayton, as part of a story about meeting a Santa Claus who signs for deaf and hard-of-hearing people.  In 1993, I worked for the   Salvation Army  during their Christmastime Kettle Drive.  Instead of ringing a bell, I played Christmas carols on my alto saxophone.  This greatly cheered up the cashiers at the Kroger where I collected donations.  They especially enjoyed my rendition of "O Holy Night."  The   Cincinnati Enquirer  did a story about how donations were down, and they contacted the Salvation Army to find someone who demonstrated a lot of Christmas spirit.  The Commander sent the photographer to me.  On Christmas Eve 1993, I was on the front page of the Cincinnati Enquirer!  In 1999 we and another family in Middletown went to   Middfest , a cross-cultural celebration that takes place each October in Middletown, Ohio, where we lived.  We had a great time, listening to the ethnic music.  My daughter Keisha and our friends' daughter Rachel, both wore overalls that day.  As the music played, I'd pick them up by the back of their overalls and swing them around.  They enjoyed that a lot, and it got the attention of the news photographer.  So, the next day, October 6th, there we all were, on the front page: I swinging both the girls at the same time.
