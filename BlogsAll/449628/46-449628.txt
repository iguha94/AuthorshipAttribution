           To: National Desk   Contact: Dirk Fillpot of the U.S. Department of Labor, 202-693-4676  HAMMOND, La., Aug. 3 /U.S. Newswire/ -- U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao told the Louisiana Economic Forum that President Bush's leadership and sound economic policies have led to strong job growth in Louisiana and across America, and that the Administration's commitment to reforming training and employment programs will help workers find and prepare for new job opportunities in the growing economy.  "Nationally, this is the 10th straight month of job growth," Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao said in the Forum's keynote address at Southeastern Louisiana University. "More than 1.5 million new jobs have been created since last August. The national unemployment rate is now 5.6 percent, which is lower than the average unemployment rate of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s."  The steady and consistent growth in the national economy is evident in Louisiana, Secretary Chao noted. Louisiana's unemployment rate has dropped a full percentage point since June of last year. Louisiana added 5,900 jobs in June, across a broad range of sectors. Secretary Chao also pointed out that while the economy continues to improve, the Administration is committed to helping workers who are still looking for good, high-paying jobs.  "These improvements are good news for Louisiana and for the country. But President Bush and this Administration recognize that there are folks in Louisiana who still need help. The Department of Labor has tremendous resources available to help workers who are looking for jobs, transitioning between jobs or upgrading their skills," Chao said.  Some of the services available to job seekers include job training and counseling. Workers can also receive help paying for transportation, child-care expenses and health insurance premiums while looking for work. Louisiana alone receives $132.8 million annually from the U.S. Department of Labor for training and employment services.  Chao also encouraged workers in need of assistance to visit one of 19 Comprehensive One-Stop Career Centers in Louisiana.
