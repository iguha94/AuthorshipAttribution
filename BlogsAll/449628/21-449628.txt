            President Bush Marks National Small Business Week    In his weekly radio address to the nation, President Bush praised small business owners (emphasis mine): Every day, millions of Americans put in long hours building businesses of their own. Their hard work strengthens the economy,  creates most of the new jobs in America , and supplies the innovation that drives our future prosperity. As we mark National Small Business Week, our nation honors the enterprise and hard work of small business owners and employees.  Small businesses are a key to upward mobility, particularly for women and minorities. There are over 3 million minority-owned small businesses across America, and that number is rising. And women-owned businesses now employ more than 9 million Americans. For the sake of all small businesses and our entire economy, my administration is pursuing an aggressive pro-growth,  pro-jobs  agenda.  The tax relief I have signed since I took office will save 25 million small business owners an average of more than $2,800 this year. Income tax relief is particularly helpful for business owners who pay their business taxes at their individual income tax rates.  We have reduced the burden of unnecessary regulation on small businesses, and we have passed much needed incentives for investment and new equipment, which will help our small businesses grow and  create high-paying jobs .  These policies are working. A recent survey of small businesses shows rising optimism among owners, evidence of improving sales, and  more plans to invest and hire new workers . This is good news for our communities and  good news for people looking for work . The President then continues, "Still, there is more to be done. I have proposed a six-point plan to  create jobs , strengthen small businesses and build employer confidence."  Let's hear it for the small business owners and their employees!
