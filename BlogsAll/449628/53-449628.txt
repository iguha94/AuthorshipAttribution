Ideas for the Family Website   I've been gathering ideas to include on our family's website.  I plan to include some information about our daughter, Keisha, who is hard of hearing.  This search has led me to some interesting sites, such as the following:     Phonak MicroLink MLx FM System , which we recently obtained;     Audiology Department, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio , where we obtained her hearing aids and FM system;     Children's Medical Center, Dayton, Ohio , where Keisha's current audiologist/speech therapist is located;     Community Services for the Deaf  in Dayton, Ohio     OtiKids  Web Site, from Oticon, who made Keisha's hearing aids   OK.  So that's it for now. Later.   Update:  Some other things to include on our family's website include   family pictures   "About" pages for Dan, Jennie, and Keisha   family mission statement   enhanced guestbook with additional fields, etc. (such as, how in the World Wide Web did you find this site?)   Either I'll use this forum to desribe what is new and as a journal, or I'll use something else.  Update:  To help visitors know what is new to the Family home page, I've provided the means to sign up for a mailing list on the home page itself, via   NotifyList.com .  I plan to send this list on a monthly basis.    So sign up now !
