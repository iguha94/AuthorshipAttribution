I've had this list in my email for quite awhile, and it's time I included it here. - DAJ     TWENTY TRUTHS TO LIVE BY   Faith is the ability to not panic. If you worry, you didn't pray. If you pray, don't worry. As a child of God, prayer is kind of like calling home every day. Blessed are the flexible, for they shall not be bent out of shape. When we get tangled up in our problems, be still. God wants us to be still so God can untangle the knot. Do the math. Count your blessings. God wants spiritual fruit, not religious nuts. Dear God: I have a problem. It's me. Silence is often misinterpreted, but never misquoted. Laugh every day. It's like inner jogging. The most important things in your home are the people. Growing old is inevitable. Growing up is optional. There is no key to happiness. The door is always open. A grudge is a heavy thing to carry. He who dies with the most toys is still dead. We do not remember days, but moments. Life moves too fast, so enjoy your precious moments. Nothing is real to you until you experience it; otherwise it's just hearsay. It's all right to sit on your pity pot every now and again. Just flush when you are done. Living your life successfully and surviving requires courage. The goals and dreams you're seeking require courage and risk taking. Learn from the turtle -- it only makes progress when it sticks out its neck. Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.
