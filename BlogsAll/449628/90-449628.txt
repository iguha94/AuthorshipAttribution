Experiment with Cisco routers and other equipment onsite and ask questions of the experts in the field about the products found in most large networks around the globe.  Also in North Hall we have our Linux Playground, including TWO speaker rooms. Linux user groups from around the area (under the direction of Don Corbet, "The Linux Guy"), have banded together to offer an extensive array of Linux speakers in their own speaker rooms!  A very special speaker we are able to present this show is none other than John "maddog" Hall, Executive Director of Linux International will be giving our keynote address on Saturday afternoon.   Don't forget to stop by the   Computerfest®  booth (#425 in East Hall). You can drop off your ticket stub and have a chance at winning our grand prize, a top of the line PC or APPLE computer system. It’s winner’s choice. This is the first time we have offered an Apple system and with the growing popularity of OS-X we wanted to make this GRAND PRIZE computer system the best ever. The PC System is a Intel P4-2.26GHZ and will be provided by PC Club.  The Apple System is a G4 iMac 700Mhz PowerPC G4 and will be provided by The MacDepot.
