I'm having dinner with JB tonight.  I've decided to tell him that I've got my own terms if we are to continue dating.  I've thought a lot about this and it occurred to me that I don't need to take cues from him, I should be able to get what I want out of this as well.  If I can't, then why should I stick around?  And men wonder why we treat them like the enemy!  I'm just tired of waiting around for guys, how about what I want for once?  I'm tired of being the nice patient girl who respects their decisions and understands what they are going through and will be there for them when they figure things out.  Fuck that!  I'm done biting my tongue and smiling in sympathy.  LOL- no I'm not ranting I'm just empowered  =)  Crazy kind of weekend...fun, boring, fun, boring, fun, boring.  Each day had it's highs and lows.  Friday night I did something I haven't done in a number of years and oh boy did I enjoy it.  Then for my own pleasure I talked to JB to rub it in or something like that.  He thought I was hilarious..I'd say I was as well.  I was probably deemed the entertainment for the night.    By the way, if any of you get conned into going to parties with Kit Kat, make sure you bring your pillow...lol. Just kidding sweet thang, it's not your fault Mishicot was such a snore.   I'd do it all over again just for you!  Yesterday, after going to the movies with Old School and her posse, I spent the rest of the evening fixing the horrible highlighting fiasco she had earlier during the day.  I told her she should always come to me for her highlights, never had a complaint yet!  Now she's all fixed and happy once again.  Tonight I've got a v-ball meeting and then well the dinner that I'm not looking forward to.  Atleast I know he'll take me somewhere expensive and he'll probably even fight to keep me around.  We'll see...
