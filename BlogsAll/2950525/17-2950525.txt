I talked to S today.  it was very weird.  It was pleasant but very weird.    it's odd how you can totally put somebody out of your mind just by not talking or seeing them.  Then the second you hear their voice or see their face that all changes.  I haven't talked to him since I got new tires and that was beginning of winter...or maybe I've talked to him once since then??  When I was on my way to meet Jax at BW3's?  That was before Christmas.  It's been so long I don't even know any more.  I don't miss him.  Well okay I'd be lying if I said that because of course there's some part of me that must miss him.  But it's a different kind of missing.  I finally realized that with S it's all or nothing.  There is no line of being friends, it's either we're together or we can't talk at all because there are too many feelings involved.    Yes I realized this all by just hearing his voice.  Just seeing his number come up on my caller id was enough for all kinds of thoughts and feelings to be dredged up.  I see his truck atleast once a week (no I'm not a stalker, his girlfriend lives in an area that I pass often) but this doesn't bother me.  If I were to see him walking to it, that may upset me.  It's odd because I've moved on completely and don't entertain thoughts of us getting back together any longer, but yet talking to him gave me a nostalgia that I can't even describe.
