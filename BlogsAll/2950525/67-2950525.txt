Another one bites the dust here at the great factory o' crap.   But I want to write about my pleasant weekend and thank all those who were involved =)  Friday:  Comedy Cafe on the agenda.  Little did I know I was being set up on a sort of blind date.  I found that out around 2:30 in the afternoon.  My roomie was setting me up with her new guy's best friend.  My review, he's tall, he's cute, he's got a good solid career, he's into motorcycles and motor cross, he's attentive, he's generous and an all around nice guy.  We had a fun night with everyone at "The Corner Bar and then off to the Comedy Cafe where we lost most of our crowd.  Only about 6 of us made it back to the Corner Bar where more drinks were had and more darts were played.    Saturday:  After waking up in a strange apartment in a strange bed I slowly remembered the four of us crashing at dude's downtown apartment.  Don't worry mom, I was a good girl.  After hitching a ride in his convertible Miata this fella asked me to lunch.  We decided to tag along with the roomie and her two little cousin's to Kopp's after I freshened up a bit.  At Kopp's we were asked  to join them bowling.  We went.  Roomie's brother, we'll call him Alchi, hit on me relentlessly and finally gave up when I beat him arm wrestling (ok I cheated).   After bowling, dude went home and so did we.  I then accompanied the roomie, her new guy, the two kids and invited CPA along to the Brewer's game.  I must say it was an awesome game and I got me a Scott Pacendick bobblehead.  Good day good day.  Cancelled my evening plans with Teaser and Ghetto Girl to stay home and watch "Jumanji" with the chitlins.    Sunday:  CAKE WAR! Can't wait to get the pictures back!  Then I highlighted Kit Kat's hair.  Apparently the jury is still out on the results though.  Hmmm, I wish it was Saturday again.  Hmmmm, 12 DAYS!!   Hmm, I wish I wasn't at work.  Hmmm, I'm easily distracted as usual.    Ciao bella.
