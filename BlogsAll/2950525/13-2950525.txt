De ja vu is the feeling you get when you feel as though you had already visited a place you'd never actually been or gone through the motions of a situation you've never experienced.  Most of us have experienced this phenom more than once.  But what do you call it when you're entire day seems as though you've played it out before? Everything from the parking spot you chose to the song playing on the radio before you turn your cube lights off?  I'm having said such a day and damn if it's not freaking me out.   Have I lived this life before?    I very much believe in life being laid out like an outfit you lay out for the next day before you go to bed.  It's there for you to put on but the trick is someone else picked the clothes for you so you don't know what will be waiting for you in the morning.      Don't buy that?  Well how about this?  Life is like a book.  All the chapters have been written and you are merely a character acting it out.  All the decisions and free will you exercise are really just a means to get you to the last chapter.  Maybe the book is like one of those mystery novels where you can choose your outcome and it tells you which page to turn to....but in the end all decisions lead to the last chapter. Only you can't peek ahead and see which choice you should make based on the outcome.  You have to make your choices with blind faith and hope that which ever path you choose is the best one.    Hmm or maybe we're all just put here to torture each other and call it a day.  I don't' even know what I'm talking about anymore.
