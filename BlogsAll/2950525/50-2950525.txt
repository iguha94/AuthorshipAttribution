Honda called last night, didn't have my phone with me (OH MY GOD) so I don't know what he wanted, but I'm guessing to beg for my forgiveness =)    Ugh, I'm in food coma. Went to Maggiano's today for a business lunch.  Oh my food food food and desert.  Started with bread and moved quickly to the side salad.  I ordered Chicken Parmesan which was delicious.  We even ordered Tiramiso(sp?) and an apple kuchen for dessert.  Ugh, someone throw me a pillow.  During our entrees I picked up my glass of soda and was about to wrap my lips around the straw when the waitress came by and snagged it right out of my hands!!!  "Let me get you a refill," she chimed as she walked away with my glass which was half full.  Whaaa??  Okay seriously, the straw was 2 inches from my mouth!  The VP and Pres of our company both looked at me in puzzlement and we all started laughing.  Later as she cleared the plates she grabbed Kris's plate and as she was lifting it off the table asked "Are you finished?," Kris slowly set down her fork!!! and again we all started laughing.  I've heard of quick turnover on tables but my oh my, maybe they should have just served us our food in the to go boxes from the get go!!!!!   Oh yea and they didn't have to seat us at the same table JB and I ate at and give us the same server, that just wasn't necessary!
