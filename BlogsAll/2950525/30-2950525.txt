Did somebody say it's Friday??  Woohoo I htink I just realized that it's Friday, and it's 3pm.  Rock on.  Ugh, I need this weekend BAD!    I'd love to just sit on the couch and veg out in front of the tv watching bad 80's movies and eating buttery popcorn in my tank and sweats but alas, I go stir crazy after about 10 minutes of that.    I'll have dinner tonight and probably head up to the local watering hole.  Wow I am such the creature of habit.  It's Friday so the natural assumption is that Funqi will be at Boz's.  Old School wishes I come with her and her crew to Rooter's to watch Exit play, sounds like a good idea but am I adventurous enough to stray from my  normal Friday activity?  I don't know if I'm ready for that!  Maybe I should considering my gal Teaser will be hitting the town with me Saturday and mentioned she'd like to go to Boz's as a first stop on our night of wild and crazy fun (I'll be home by 11---bet).    Somewhere along the line I have become predictable...I need to have one of those nights where you just let the road lead the way and pick up some hitch hikers on the way.  One of those nights where your crew of able bodied drinkers somehow multiplies from 2 to 20 and by the end of the night you're trying to remember where exatly you left your car all the while knowing you'd be better off if you didn't find it.  A night of shots, bar hopping, dancing on tables and flirting with strangers.  Mmmm to be that ripe young age of 26 again ;)
