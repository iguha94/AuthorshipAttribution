It seems as though I cannot get enough sleep.  I slept for the better part of our 3 hour drive home from "up north" and continued my slumber with cat naps throughout the day.  Eventually I fell asleep somewher between 9:30 and 10pm.  It' snot as if I didn't get any sleep this weekend.  Well I suppose sleeping on a rock hard ground after you've been heavily consuming beer, korbel and jagerbombs steady is not the best effort for sleep.  Continuing on to the next day where the kick off of my day is a jack and coke followed by cashing off a bottle of Hurricane between two people and moving onward and upward to more korbel and a few beers thrown in there somewhere....while swigging from a jug of hot sex and taking double gulps of Doctor's as it makes it's way around the campfire.  Yea that makes for a great night of sleep as well.  Atleast there was an air mattress to roll around on instead of that ground with the rock that no matter where I moved to followed my right shoulder around.  Good times.   Best Line of the Weekend:   Crazy Jer's Wife "You've got hair all over you" said as she picked dog hair from the front of his black shirt.   Crazy Jer "Yea baby, I just got off the dog" said with arms outstretch pulling at the air while jutting his groin back and forth.
