I just can't wait for the weekend to start.   my highly ambitious ass turned to mush last night.  I got home tired but determined.   Made some rice and Italian tomatoes for din din and started a load of laundry.  Unloaded the dishwasher and took out the garbage.  I then ate my dinner and proceeded to attempt a nap.  Instead I called Kit Kat and asked her to go shopping with me.  We went to Starship, Maxx, Wally Mart and McD's...as we drove through the drive thru that runs parallel to the golf range I drooled and debated coming back to hit some balls.  After all, it WAS 65 degrees out.    In the end I finished everything I needed to do at the stores  but I took so long dickin' around that I wasted a lot of cleaning time.  In the end I finished my laundry (towels are currently in the dryer) cleaned the basement top to bottom for the party,  and painted my nails.    Tonight I must tackle my room before everyone comes over.  Most would say to just keep the door shut but that's just not possible with my friends =)  Now I'm at work while Angie's at home cleaning the rest of the house...well actually she's probably still sleeping.  She told me to call in sick...oh if I only had the luxury to call in sick on a Friday when everyone knows I'm having a party and it's going to be 80 today...yea they'd believe I'm sick...uh-huh.
