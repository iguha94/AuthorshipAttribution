People are intimidated by me.  People come to me when they need someone to fight for them, whether it's dealing with a vendor at work or it's returning faulty merchandise to a store that won't take it.  I am not afraid to speak my  mind whether you want to listen or not and rarely do people get the opportunity to take advantage of me.  This year alone I've had 2 crappy meals comped and gift certificates given to me as compensation, I've gotten my cell phone company to agree to waive replacement charges for my defective phone, I've gotten my insurance company to lower my rates simply because I didn't' want to pay the higher ones.  I made a man feel two inches tall after he performed an unsolicited grope, I stood up to a mechanic  who thought that because I was a woman I knew nothing about the repairs he did and he could charge me what he wanted in the end I paid half of what he was billing me ... I could go on, however the list is too long.  I may sometimes let people take advantage of me but usually this is so that in the end I can get what I want.  A very manipulative minx I am, but a push over I am not.  I don't know why I even care if people perceive me as a push over, maybe that's not such a bad thing considering I'm more of the in your face type person and sometimes worry about others perceptions.  But meek I am not.    'Nuff said?  God I'm a bitch.
