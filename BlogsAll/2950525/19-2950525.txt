Ah, today is my Friday.  I'll be in Green Bay for the next two days for the state pool tournament.  I've been practicing a lot lately so hopefully I'll be able to bring home some money...sha-right.  I'm more likely to bring home a hang over.  I've got to get up at the ass crack of dawn tomorrow and be on the road by 6am.  I've got to get my stick re-tipped tonight, head to the bank to make a deposit, pack a bag for the trip, finish up my laundry, all before 8pm tonight when I have to be at the bar to shoot leagues.  Ugh.    If I were smart I would have come home from the bowling banquet last night and did chores or went right to sleep instead of seeing   Starsky and Hutch  with JB.  But I'd say it was worth it, cuz it was fu-u-u-nny.  I've also come to the conclusion that no matter how much time I have to get ready in the morning I will  always  be late.  I got home this morning at 6:15....a full hour and 45 minutes before I needed to be here and I was still 5 minutes late!!!  Usually I'm crawling out of my cloud at 7:15!!!!  Today I brought in bbq and jello and chips for lunch to share with everyone today (in a momentary lapse of judgment at lunch yesterday I offered to make extras for lunch and it became lunch for 8).  After cooking 80 thousand pounds of sloppy joes yesterday for the banquet and today's lunch, I'm not much in the mood to eat it!!!  I'm going to go through   Kit Kat   withdrawals this weekend!  I won't see her sweet ass until next week.  This makes me sad, very sad.  Funny Marquee of the week:  Oil Change $18.99 Every Saterday   What's a Sater and how did it get it's own day?   AMF!!!
