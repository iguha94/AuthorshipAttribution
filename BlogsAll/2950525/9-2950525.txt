I woke up this morning and cursed myself as I walked past the mirror and noticed a new crinkle that cuts across my nose.  My hair is the texture of straw that has been baked in the sun for days and the skin under my eyes is the color of a fading bruise.   My over processed hair and under pampered skin is telling me to slow down and stop hanging out in smoky bars.  You might wonder how one person can come to so many conclusions in one brief 3 second glance in the mirror...well as a woman, let me tell you that it's not that difficult.  If you've ever "tripped" you've probably been told not to look in the mirror, your face suddenly becomes a sea of endless pores, dirt, and oil patches.  You eyes look to be the size of golf balls and shine so bright you could probably light up the room.  Every hair on your head is visible as a single strand and if you get close enough you can see the hole in which the root has attached itself to your head.  These are the things I notice as I look in the mirror, every change that has come in the middle of the night.  Today, my shoulder aches a little more and my knee buckles as I bend over to put on my boots.  Why didn't I listen when my mom would tell me to take care of myself while I was young so as not to regret it when I'm older?  I'm 27 years young and feel a though someone snatched my young body and replaced it wih that of an aging football player.  You might think that today is my birthday the way I speak, but it's not.  Today is just Tuesday.
