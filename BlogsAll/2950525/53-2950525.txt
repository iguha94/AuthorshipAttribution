Sad Magnet Face today.  There is nothing else in this world that I would like to do less right now as work.  I didn't know that my cloud had a wrong side, but this morning I managed to find it when I got up.    I didn't go camping as planned Saturday.  Instead I slept off a hang over and didn't make it over to my Newly Single Not So Much a Brother's house for the drive up.  Oh well, I had a nice relaxing evening doing not much of anything and in the end I can't complain.  It would have been fun to hang out with the boyz, do some fishin' and catch frogs with Short Fry, but the cold day and drinking wouldn't have appealed to me much.    Last night CPA and I went to see the whales.  We watched the waves crash into the breaker wall and reminisced about the old days of ShoeBall and nights spent at Grant Park watching the sun come up.   I had a very reflective weekend.  It seems like everything I did dredged up many memories from my past and many demons I haven't dealt with in years.  Thinking about all the people who have come in and out of my life.  People I'd all but forgotten and people who I'll never forget.  I realized that we are truly alone in this world, no matter how many people we surround ourselves with.
