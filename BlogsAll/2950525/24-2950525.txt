So I went to pool last night.  After sleeping on and off from 2pm on, I decided to venture out after all.  And was it ever a nightmare.  I think Big B and I were the only ones not having fun.  He had a migraine and I was clutching my kleenex in the corner trying to stay away from all the smoke.  My new best friend Tiff was in true form having consumed enough alcohol to drunken an entire high school football team.  Let me tell you, there is nothing more annoying then drunk people trying to get you to dance...grind rather...with them when all you want to do is crawl onto your cloud and drift into slumber.    Everybody and their brother was at the bar last night, which I normally would have been grateful for, but instead my tolerance for human beings was so low that even my most cherished bar buddies got the cold shoulder.  My pool game suffered as well...although it can't really suffer much when it's not much to write home about in the first place.   So for the second week in a row I managed to escape the bar stone cold sober.  I had two tall glasses of orange juice all night.  Bartender Stoney, as he's known, had such an incredulous look on his face when I refused each shot that was bought for me, however judging from the sound of  his   voice this morning when he phoned me he must have doubled up and took them for me.  In conclusion, it was all worth it because today I feel much better and will be healthy for the weekend.
