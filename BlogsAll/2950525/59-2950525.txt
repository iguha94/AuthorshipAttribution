Introducing a new character to the story of my life:  valentino  valentino has spent the last 7 1/2 years in jail.  I dated him slightly before S and I hooked up.  I call him valentino because of valentine's day 1997.  It was a Friday evening and I had spent the last 14 hours at work.  I was managing a bar and waitressing Friday and Saturday nights as well.   My car had taken a crap on me and I needed a ride home.  Well valentino thought hanging out with his friends was more important and he told me that I should call my mom.  So instead I called S and I hung out the rest of the night.  He showed up with a dozen roses and chocolate covered cherries.  Two days later S bought me a diamond heart necklace and told me he was falling in love with me...  Well that valentine's day was the last I heard from valentino because the next day he was arrested in some bar fight and ended up getting a bad deal and sent to prison in Tennessee for the next 10-15 years.  Seven and a half years, countless letters and dozens of phone calls later he is being realized.  June 1st of this year he will walk out a free man.  The last letter I just received was very hopeful for him and I to go out and start seeing each other again.    He's come to this epiphany about life and tells me that my letters have been very encouraging to him and have changed his outlook on life.    SIDE NOTE:  I should seriously consider counseling prisoners because my old friend D-Duck was in and out of juvey and jail since he was 13 and this last stint he served 4 1/2 years for assault and battery.  I wrote to him for all that time as well and he came out with a new outlook and completely grateful for all my words of wisdom, he's been out for 3 years and hasn't got into any trouble at all.  END SIDE NOTE  Well congratulations valentino on your reform, but I don't think my pops nor my moms would appreciate me bringing home an ex-con!!!!
