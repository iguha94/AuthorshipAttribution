Correction:&nbsp; It was not Big C who spilled the beer, it was Slightly Stupid.&nbsp; Get those brothers mixed up.   CPA has requested the Sluggo's phone story. So my good friend Bumpy works for a landscaping company and we saw a guy who had&nbsp;a Chremlawn T-shirt on.&nbsp; I inquired as to where/what Chremlawn was, her response: "Call the number!"&nbsp; now being buzzed and slightly bored at the moment, I dialed the number on the back of dude's t-shirt.&nbsp; To my own chagrin he raised his cell phone to his ear.&nbsp; After a few moments of confusion I hung up the phone after hearing the "hello".&nbsp; TO my horror moments later he called me back!!!&nbsp; Oh that was all I needed to be prompted to have a little fun.&nbsp; I called back and hung up as he raised his phone towards his ear.&nbsp; This was incredibly hilarious for some reason!&nbsp; Then one of the boys in our group decided it'd be funny to go and tell him it was me "No!" I cried as he&nbsp; moved in the dude's direction.&nbsp; THankfully he did not tell him and I was able to continue my fun.&nbsp; As my cell phone started ringing again I noticed this guy scanning the bar.&nbsp; I called him back and was able to leave him a voice mail "You shouldn't wear your cell phone number on your shirt!" and promptly hung up.&nbsp; I started to receive phone calls from him and his buddy's number and was very amused as I watched them scanning the bar for girls with cell phones.&nbsp; Hee hee hee...this was my entertainment watching these monkeys trying to locate the perp.&nbsp; At one point I left the building to talk on my cell and received 3 calls while there.&nbsp; As well as a call from CPA and Bumpy.&nbsp; Apparantely while I was away they started chatting up some of&nbsp; dude's buddies who were playing Golden Tee by our table...they told them that some girl in the bar was calling their friend and they were trying to figure out who it was.&nbsp; I finally threw him a bone as CPA and I exited the bar,I patted dude on the back and said "That was me by the way."&nbsp; Yes, yes it was funnier in the moment.&nbsp; Yes, yes it is a "had to be there" story.&nbsp; Yes, yes I am in 3rd grade!
