Last night was strange.  Teaser and I had a "celebration of food" last night accompanied with some half price margaritas.  The conversation was preoccupied by reminiscing of the days when we were attached at the hip.  Now a full time student, two part time jobs, a live in boyfriend and his live in teenager, she's hardly got time to blow her nose let alone party like a rock star.  I then returned home to call JB and tell him to bugger off however apparently he forgot how to answer his phone...that's a first.  I received a text in the am asking if he can call me after golf tonight.  My response to that?  NOTHING.    I spent almost an hour on the tele with Stacey's Mom last night, she's 41 and having almost the same problem that I've been dealing with, this leads me to question:  Does it ever end?  I also had hours of convo with my roomie where she pondered many of the same questions.  I feel as if I need to throw back some beers, get down and dirty in the mud and get rid of some of the estrogen that has been plaguing me for the last couple of weeks.  I've been such a girl...now where should I hide those feelings?  Oh and I've come to the conclusion with the steady help of Nutter Butter that I'm moving to the Dominican Republic and running a resort out of my home.  He won't let me go to Antartica because it's cold or something...so I'm off to be closer to the equator.  Adios!
