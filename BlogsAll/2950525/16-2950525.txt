I came over after work and took a bath with him.  He scrubbed my back as I rubbed his feet.  The bubbles got a little out of control and we splashed around making a mess on the black tile floor.    We went to the bedroom to take a nap.  We were staring at the ceiling giggling and joking around with each other.  Bickering about which really  is   better, peanut butter or jelly.  It was all a bunch of silliness until she walked in.  I dove under the covers of the top bunk, yes I said bunk.  She came in the room whistling and excited to see him.  She reached up to my bunk and grabbed my leg, quickly moving it and grabbing the suitcase next to me.    "I'm going to pack for our trip now while you nap" she told him.  She goes to the closet and starts chattering away about her day.  He looks nervously up at me as I catch his eye I mouth to him "she knows I'm here."   I'm ashamed and I feel like I've been cheated somehow.   He grabs her and takes her into the bathroom to take a shower together.  I scramble out from underneath the covers and head for the door.  She comes back into the room with soap bubbles on her feet and whispers to me that she knows what I've been doing.    He's in the shower now, alone.  She and I sit down with a cup of coffee and I tell her everything.  I feel a mixture of self loathing, pity for her, embarassment for me, shame, understanding, sympathy, hatred and jealousy.  I leave them together and walk down the street alone.  Yelling to anyone around me that he's wrong and he has made a mistake.  A man approaches me and asks me why I don't tell him that.  "I can't" I respond.   I woke up at 3 am in a sweat with my heart racing.  This was my dream last night, every detail was remembered.
