A very hung over me staggered out of my ultra-comfy bed yesterday morning and stared in the mirror.  Can I sacrifice a shower for 20 more minutes of sleep?  Of course!!  I get to work knowing that in 8 short hours I can go home and crawl back into bed.  Then the phone starts and disaster strikes.  My day is filled with running in and out of meetings, consoling and apologizing to customers and trying to find a resolution to a monstrous problem that was caused by someone else.  Slowly I realize that I haven't had time to get anything done and I have a stack of work to be tended to.  The decision to stay late is made and suddenly I have completed a 12 hour day with one short break for lunch.  Depleted of all my energy and mental capacity at a negative I head for home.  Leaving work at the absurd hour of 8pm, I realized that there was nobody out there wondering why I wasn't home and worrying if something had happened.  Nobody knew nor cared that I had one of the worst days possible.  I arrived home safely and staggered through the house to the bedroom, I stopped to stare in the mirror.  A shower would have felt like heaven right then.  Instead I opt for a cup of hot cocoa and a cuddle with Teddy (Teddy as in Mr. Teddy P. Bear) before drifting off to sleep.  I betcha Teddy wondered and worried about me not being home.
