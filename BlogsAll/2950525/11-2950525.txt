The problem with being good at something is that people always come to me for help or with questions.  Not that I mind helping other people, it's just that I'd rather teach them to do it for themselves then have them come to me each time.  But it's easier for them to just come to me and have me do it for them.  It's almost like as an adult they feel like they don't need to learn anymore.    What would have happened to you if every time you needed your shoe tied your mom or dad or teacher or friend did it for you and you never learned?   And what if your mom never taught you how to use a fork and knife, she spoon fed you all the way until you left the house?  I'm constantly called upon to format a spreadsheet, upload to an ftp site, fix a crashed computer, write a letter of thanks, research a product, call a vendor with a stern hand...when does it end?    Then there's the problem with being on a committee is that the person who's got the best ideas and the skills to get things done is that they get stuck with all the work.  Hmm I think a told you so is in order to my boss.  People only do what they can get away with doing and let other people pick up the slack.  Seems to be a problem with society as a whole.  Now I'm just rambling, so I'm going to go sit and the corner and ponder why it is that I couldn't have been just another D student.
