Why does life have to come with so many decisions? I put a security deposit down on my new apartment and then yesterday talked with my newly single not so much a brother Matt about being roommates.  A couple weeks ago I had made mention in passing to him that I'd be looking for a new place soon and if him and SuperFreak seriously broke up I'm open to having a roommate.    Now he's stating to me that he may be interested, but he needs just a little time to get things straight in his head.  He did after all just move out of there and back into his mom's house.  Let's examine this.  Cons: MNSNSMABM is my long term ex's brother. is my good good friend SuperFreak's now ex-boyfriend. has been known to be somewhat of a hmmm man whore, before meeting SuperFreak. likes to party and works second shift...lots of noise late at night? isn't exactly notorious for being a neat freak nor a responsible individual. is a boy and I'm not quite sure that JB would be too thrilled about that. Pros: MNSNSMABM is seriously like a brother to me and we have always been very close. is the father to the most adorable little boy in the world who still thinks of me as Auntie Lisa and I'd get to see him every other weekend like I used to. would be paying half the bills in a larger apartment then what I'd afford on my own. has a job he's been at it for 8 years now and has been getting better with money.   works second shift for the greater part of the year and would barely be around when I'm there anyway. is a boy and I wouldn't have to deal with any bullshit.  What do I do?
