I won in one of my pools...yippee.  I drank enough alcohol lined fruit smoothies yesterday to support the fruit industry.  Yummy!!!  I think that's going to be my latest obsessions...Thanks Pop for the smoothie maker.  I came to the conlusion last night that I have the best friends ever.  I was lying in my cloud last night re-thinking the events of my weekend.  I realized how lucky I am.    Each friend that was over last night serves a different purpose in my life.  Each of them have been there for me in different times in my life and it makes me all warm and gooey inside to have them all over and realize that they are there for me...not the alcohol, not the food, not the game...but me.  They came to MY party to hang out with me.  I remember a day when the only person I really cared about in my life was my bf.  I had no real girlfriends to speak of.  And now as I look around my cube and look over the pictures of all my friends I just feel so happy to have them.  To know that I can call on any one of them with tears in my voice and no matter what they are doing, they will stop and listen to what's wrong.  They don't judge me or what I do.  Of course they have opinions and aren't afraid to give them, but that's okay.  I have such a great and diverse group of friends, I hand picked some and fell into others, but all in all, there isn't a single one of them that I'd trade in.  I feel very lucky to be surrounded by such wonderful people.  I've been so distraught at losing one of my bestest friends that I seem to forget how important the ones I have really are.  It's sad to lose a friend but it's sadder to not appreciate the ones you have.
