what my 12 smiles mean (thank you kit kat for the reference). what emotion I'm feeling in just one simple word of "Hello". which blanket I want when I'm sick and which blanket I want when we're cuddling up for a movie. what it means when I stare at the floor, what it means when I stare at him, what it means when I stare off in the distance. what my eyes are saying. what I like on my toast and what my favorite drink is. what time I'm at my best and what time I'm at my worst. what I'd like to change about myself. what my biggest fear is. what makes me the most self conscious. which "Friends" character is my favorite and which is most like me. who I like more my boss or my job. which buttons to push and which ones to stay away from. when I need a hug. how to make fun of me.  I'm afraid of not finding that connection with somebody ever again.  Not finding someone who can get into my head the way others have.  Not finding someone who I can bounce off of and who bounces off of me.  Not finding someone who compliments me as I compliment him.  Not finding someone where just the thought of him makes me smile.    If I ever find it again, I'll never letting it go.  I will fight for it if I have to.  I won't lose it again.
