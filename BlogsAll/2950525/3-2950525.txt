*begin rant* god, why is it that men think they can just grab/touch/feel a woman whenever wherever they feel like.  okay I can stand a touch on the arm or back and even the occasional squeeze around my shoulders.  But grabbing my ass is a whole other story.  That is what is considered a private part and is off limits for unsolicited groping.  Especially not from some random guy in the store!!!  And let me tell you, telling me I've got a sweet ass or big tits isn't a compliment and doesn't warrant a thank you,  unless you know me like that.  Men are so fucking clueless sometimes it's pathetic.  I'm so tired of having to fend off this kind of attention.    And the dude at the dance club...kissing me the way he did and pushing his dick into my leg like I'm some kind of whore for hire.  I actually thought he was a nice guy until I realized he was just another jackass looking to get laid.  And his friends, looking me up and down and asking him who this "sexy bitch".  As if sexy and bitch belong in the same sentence as a compliment?!?!? The only people allowed to call me a "sexy bitch" are my friends.  What ever happened to, 'hi my name is Tim, I'm Tom's friend" and shaking my hand?  What the f#%$?  Where's my knight in shining armor to fend off these jerks, I fight my own battles , but for once I'd like to drop the act and let someone take care of me.   Someone to fight for my honor damn it.  Where have all the cowboys gone?  The men who would start a bar room brawl with a  man just for looking at my tits.   *end rant*
