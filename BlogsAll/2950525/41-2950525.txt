I guess I just ask to much of our receptionist who answers phones and receive faxes!  This is so ridiculous it's hilarious.  This woman calls in atleast 2  times a month and is seriously 2-4 hours late 3 times a month.  They won't fire her because she's one of these people who blame everything on the fact that she's black.  I ask her to pay a little more attention to who the recipient is on a fax and this is what I get.       Lisa,            You are the only one that send me e-mails regarding my mistakes or timeliness of forwarding them.  (IT'S PROBABLY CUZ YOU FUCK MINE UP THE MOST)      I'm sorry I routed it to the wrong person, but,  I'M HUMAN! (IT SAID ATTN. LISA HOT RUSH AND YOU SENT IT TO DEBBIE WHO'S ON VACATION UNTIL THE 19TH YOU DUMB FUCK) The time you spent typing this e-mail perhaps another job could have been completed. (I TYPE 70 WPM, MY 2 PARAGRAPH EMAIL TOOK ALL OF ABOUT 2 MINUTES TO TYPE AND SEND) Another thing, I do a lot of other things besides sit & route faxes. (LIKE SURF THE INTERNET AND FORWARD JOKES??? WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU DO, NOBODY WANTS TO ASK YOU TO DO ANYTHING CUZ YOU SCREW EVERYTHING UP AND YOU'RE NOT RELIABLE ENOUGH TO BE HERE) I get calls all day long from people that want to speak to Lisa--- which Lisa? There has          been two Lisa(s) here for months now, please give and ask your customers to ask for you by first and      and last names. I'd really appreciate it.  (I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO THE ABSURDITY OF THIS STATEMENT).       Thanks Much      Marie  I got an earful from my customer and then the sales person called me wanting to know what's going on. Being one of our biggest customers, she is upset that it took me 3 hours to get back to her on something that was a hot rush.  I didn't even have the fax.  But of course I won't tell the customer this.  I'll take the fall.  Yikes!
