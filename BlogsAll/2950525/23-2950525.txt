Here it is Monday again and I may be becoming rather predictable as I am about to ramble on about my weekend.  Friday:  Went to a Texas Hold 'Em poker party at BH's.  Coincidentally three of the players were guys I went to high school with.  A year below me and amazingly they knew who I was and were impressed with the way I "turned out", don't know quite what to do with that.  Good night, I was up about $300 early on in the game and left with an extra $150 in my pocket by the end of the night.  I won some nice pots and played some good games.    Later that evening I decided to head out with Short Fry and went to the Drift Inn to socialize with ghosts from my past.  And by the way NB if you are reading this, Chad and Clay say hello and Chad is especially jealous of your recent winnings.  Saturday:  Had my first fight with JB this weekend.  Which led me over to Kit Kat's to meet Marine Mike and hang out with her and Flashdance (is that right Kit Kat?) for the evening.  Then I decided to let up on JB and end his torture by going over and seeing him. All in all our fight was a good thing cuz I learned a some things about myself and about him.  I learned that I am growing up and have a new found maturity to handling "relationship type issues".  I learned that I   have   learned from previous relationships!  I am now officially a part of a couple.  I now officially have a boyfriend for the first time in 3 years, it still sounds foreign to me, but it's kept a grin on my face for the last 48 hours.  We'll see how I'm feelin' in a couple weeks when I realize what I've done!!  Oh the horror!  Sunday:  I went to see a very powerful movie with Kit Kat and Old School.  You may have heard of it "Passion"?  It brought emotions out that I hadn't realized were there, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen as I watched a story I consider to be fiction and pondered what the reality of it all really is.  I highly recommend this to even the least religious of people.
