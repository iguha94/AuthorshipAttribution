Night Ranger  -  Midnight Madness  When You Close Your Eyes&nbsp;  &nbsp;  What do you do  When it's falling apart  And you knew it was gone  From the very start  Do you close your eyes  And dream about me  &nbsp; A girl in love  With a gleam in her eye  I was a younger boy  All dressed in white  We're older now  Do you still think about me  I remember  &nbsp; We learned about love  In the back of a Chevrolet  Well, it felt so good to be young  Feels like yesterday  &nbsp; CHORUS  When you close your eyes  Do you dream about me  When you close your eyes  Do you dream about me  Do you still dream about me  &nbsp; I guess I don't know  What I'm thinking  Coming off A hard night of drinking  Angie, come closer to me  I need a soul to bleed on  &nbsp; It could'a been done  In a different kinda way  But that ain't you  You play tough when you play  It's over now  I bet you still think about me  &nbsp; I remember I held you so tight  And we danced the night away  With the moves  Of two wide-eyed kids  I need you so much today  &nbsp; CHORUS  &nbsp; I remember  We learned about love  In the back of a Chevrolet  No good for an old memory  To me and so much today
