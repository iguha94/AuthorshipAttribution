I haven't written anything here for over a week because I've been uninspired.  Haven't had much to say.  I've lost a certain passion for life somewhere in the last few weeks.  I've been drifting in and out of reality with no real concept of how much time has passed.    It's already the second week of February and I'm unsure if I've realized any of the goals I set for myself in the new year.  I've resumed the nasty habit of smoking.  It's not an every day occurrence but atleast once a week and sometimes twice I indulge myself and manage to go through a pack every couple of weeks.  I haven't joined Bally's like I set out to do, partly because of my busy schedule but mostly because it would be a waste of money since I probably wouldn't even go.  The other 3 or 4 promises I made to myself...I don't even remember what they were anymore.    I've decided I've got no self control or discipline and am so self absorbed that I just do what I want when I want no matter what/who is involved.  I used to think I was agood person with good intentions and that made it okay to be an asshole once in a while and made it okay to be selfish.  I'm so bored with this life, can I exchange it for a shiny new red one?  Some would say my life is very full and even exciting, but I've been on this track for so long that it's starting to be monotonous.  Maybe it's winter, maybe it's Wisconsin...but I need a change.  Something drastic to jump start my excite-o-meter.  But what?  I'm going skydiving this spring.  That'll be a rush for all of about 3 hours.  Then how will I top that?  One rush just leads to another to top it and so on and so on, you do so many things in your life, pretty soon there's nothing else to top it.
