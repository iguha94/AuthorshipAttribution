I went and looked at an apartment yesterday.  It was cute but I'm slowly getting ticked about the fact that Cantbealone is having her boyfriend move into the house.  One of my biggest reasons for hesitating on giving up my cute little cottage and moving in with her was that it had to be for a lengthy period of time and her finding a new guy to move in with her was a big thing that we discussed.  She assured me that it wouldn't happen.  If she really thinks I"m not upset by this she must be living in a cave.  So I'm just going to quietly find an apartment and move out.   The place I looked at last night was cute but I really couldn't see myself living there for a lengthy period of time and I am soooooooooo sick of moving that I've got to find somewhere I can call home for a few years.  Went to Pieces of Eight with JB last night.  We ordered a bottle of wine and had steak and prime rib...yummy.  We then went into the bar and sat by the fireplace for a couple hours of conversation.  I finally opened my mouth about the things that have been bugging me.  I feel much better today because I've got a much better understanding of him.  My original feelings of running far far away have been squelched.  I think I'll keep him around for a bit longer.   It's odd however, I'm not used to having a guy who recognizes when he's wrong and when he's being an ass.  S had this golden quality of being able to turn any issue around on me and somehow I'd believe that his forgetting to pick up milk on his way home was MY fault.  I kind of like this new side of man that I am seeing.
