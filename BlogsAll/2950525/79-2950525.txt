I'm very tired of hearing about babies and weddings.&nbsp; My boss here just became a grandma a couple weeks ago, and just found out that her daughter is pregos and due in December.&nbsp; Another woman here just became an aunt and the daddy is somebody who used to work here.&nbsp; One of our retired senior partners just let us know that he's going to be a grandpa in January.&nbsp; Somebody overheard our President talking on the phone and he said "we already know the sex" leading us to believe that his wife is with child.&nbsp; One of the gals around here is getting married in September and another is planning a wedding for next February.&nbsp; Another former coworker will be wed in April.&nbsp; If I have to listen to any more wedding and baby talk I swear I'll shoot myself.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am boyfriendless and childless,&nbsp; according to everyone here as they look at me with sympathetic eyes and say "You're day will come".&nbsp; As if I'm waiting around for Prince Charming to walk in the door, sweep me off my feet and bear me the fruits of his loins so I may become the wife and mother I was meant to be.&nbsp; Are you kidding me?&nbsp; I'm not a spinster just because I"m almost 28 years old and still single.&nbsp; Did it ever occur to anybody that I may actually choose to be single and that I like the life I have?&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean seriously, I am happy with my life.&nbsp; Yes I may get lonely from time to time but I'm perfectly happy and SANE to be alone.&nbsp; I do not measure my worth by who's waiting for me at home, so what if it's a roommate and two cats and not a husband and children.&nbsp; When I'm damn good and ready  I &nbsp;will walk into  his  life and if  he's  lucky, bear him the fruit of  my  loins!&nbsp; (And no I'm not some kind of feminist, I would just like to make the point that I'm not waiting around for anybody!)
