Spent the night at Boz's hanging out with Freebird and other various members of the Boz's gang.  Am I ever going to feel normal around him?  I caught myself toning down the party girl inside of me whenever I saw him looking at me.  That's odd, I've only ever done that with one other guy...okay  maybe more than one...but nonetheless I don't usually do that unless somebody makes me nervous.  And most men don't make me nervous unless I've got some sort of feelings for them.  Uh-oh.  Is it the bad girl in me looking for the bad boy in him?  Is it the last 8 years of letters exchanged?  Is it the fact that I swear to God when we hung up the phone last night I heard him say "I love you" in a mumbled tone?!?! - God I wish I hadn't been half asleep when we talked.    I seem to be overrun with boys these days.  I have gotten 4 text messages from 3 different dudes and 2 phone calls since I got to work this morning.  Vince wants me to go to a wedding with him next Saturday (say what???  we haven't even had a "real" date yet).  Todd is vieing for my attention this weekend but I'm keeping him at arms distance, why? I'm not sure.  Nice guy, bought me a Ferrari hat after he got back from Indy a couple weekends ago after only knowing me for a week =)  I like those gestures-sweet.  Then I'm supposed to have dinner or something with Brian tomorrow.  My gf's want me to bring a man out tonight, "pick one and bring him" they say...and all I'm thinking is "hell no then I can't pick up any guys!"  Sad.  Is this the definition of a player?  I never thought of myself like that but man the title seems to fit.  I always have 2 or 3 guys I'm "working on"...I need to narrow my scope cuz I'd really like to have some sexercise soon.   I'm not a player, I'm just a girl who's having fun being single!
