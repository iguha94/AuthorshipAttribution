         Marine Mike came up Saturday.  He's hot.  Wasn't as uncomfortable around him as I feared I would be... actually he's way more of a dork than I originally thought.  That's okay, thought, b/c I too am a DBC (Dork By Choice).  We hung  out at my place, using Funquita and Flashdance as my backup.  Everything was going great until they left and I had to seriously work to keep my new Celebacy Pact in effect.  He wasn't being a dick, just persistant, but I don't care how many languages he speaks, 'No' is universal in all (except Japanese, apparently, which he  just had to point out).  After making him feel like the disrespectful shit he was being, we had a good talk and he apologized.  He still slept on the floor though.. probably afraid I'd knee him in the balls when he was all vulnerable and unexpecting.  And he still didn't get any the next morning either, even when I caught him without his shirt...and let me tell you, ladies, tempations run high when facing a body that beautifully sculpted!!  I still haven't decided how I feel about him.    Had another marathon phone call with Butcher Bill last night, too.  We're tentativly rescheduling for Wednesday, he has to make sure he can get out of his bowling league...AWWWWW!!!... j/k.  He marveled at how well we get along... how he hates talking on the phone, yet he'll talk to me for hours.  How he was thinking the other day, "Wow, my life is going pretty good, I'm moving into a new place... I've been talking to an awesome girl...." (that's me, in case anyone was wondering).  That was sweet, I hope I don't have to break his heart... of course Marine Boy already has me pegged for marriage practically....I might have to take a poll amongst my whoppin' 3 followers to decide who to choose =)
