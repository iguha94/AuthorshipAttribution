wow, I'm really starting to sound bitter.  so let's take a minute to look at the positive things in my life.  1.  I am alive.  My health is good (well except for the constant pain in my knee).  2.  I have friends who love me and who mostly would do anything for me.  Friends who are there for me and want to see me happy.  Friends who look out for me and want to protect me.  Friends who miss me when I'm not around.  Friends who put up with me no matter how ridiculous I am being and friends who deal with my soap opera life.  3.  I have family who always love and support me no matter how disfunctional we are.  Family who picks me up when I need it and family who puts me in my place when my head gets too big.  4. I have a good job and work with a great staff of people whom I consider my friends.  Something I have been searching for for along time.  5.  I've got a roof over my head (for now) and a nice vehicle to tool around town in.  I don't go hungry and I have the luxury of buying what I want and going where I want.    6.  I'm intelligent, attractive and have a good sense of humor.  I have fun with most things I do and lead a very active life.  I've got a big heart and a lot of love to give someone.  All in all, life ain't so bad =)
