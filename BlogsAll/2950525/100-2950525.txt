         Last night was a little bit crazy.  What started out as a nice, short night of cards and drink turned into a full fledged drunken peanut tossing, shit talkin, coffee table crashing alll nighter.  Flash, Sammy and Matt came over.  Have to say, I have a new perspective on Matt.  For awhile I was thinking he's a chump, but we had good conversation last night.  When we FINALLY went to bed at, ahem, 4:53 a.m.  he jumped in bed next to me and spooned me like no other.  Ahhh... and it didn't annoy me! (unlike the Butcher Bill episode).  Haven't had that good o' cuddling since Funquita and The Chair  ; )   I'm happy things are back to normal with us, I like that we're friends AND can snuggle - such a bonus!   Anyway, shit was so NOT cool when I woke up in a panic at 7:28 a.m. after sleeping thru my alarm for 40 minutes.  Had to do rapid change, mexican shower, hair in pony mode.  Took me a good amount of screaming and kicking and hair pulling to wake Flash's ass up and then she putzed around forEVER.... And to my great surprise we STILL made it to work with 5 minutes to spare!!!!     They're trying to drag me out to the Rooster AGAIN.. these crazy kids.  There's a time when I have to put my foot down and say NO, I can't handle this partying every night routine, I'm starting to look a little haggard!!
