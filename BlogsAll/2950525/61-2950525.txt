ALOHA-2 more days and I'm checking my bags in at the airport and getting ready to board the plane!  This is my last day of work before I leave...unless of course I decide to come in for a couple of hours tomorrow which I may just do.  Getting ready to go on vacation is hella stressful at work.    I've got most of what I wanted to get accomplished at home finished.  I'm bailing on the Summerfest plan tonight simply because I'm still sick sick sick and I need the time for rest and relaxation.  Tomorrow I've got to make up my golf match and go to Mags for my pedicure, then it's off to Summerfest with the gals.    I saw Jailbird last night for the first time since he's been a Freebird.  It was really good to see him and to my own surprise those old feelings came back to me.  I now remember why it was so hard for me to choose between him and S all those years ago.  Keeping things strictly as friends may be a little harder than I thought. Talked to Teaser only moments ago and she was surprised to hear me talk like that.    She said that I have the highest standards of anybody she's ever met and she can't believe that I won't date a guy with a kid but I'd even consider dating an ex-con.  I didn't say I was considering it!!  I just said I wish things were different.  I was a little surprised to hear that she thought this of me though, she also said I was super picky.  This I knew, I've also come to the realization that as much as I say I don't fear being vulnerable and am a very open person, I've got walls built that need to come down in order for me to let somebody into my world.  Revelations all over the place today.    Hawaii is a much needed vacation and I'm hoping to get my thoughts together on my life and where I want it to go.  I can't just keep coasting along and expect things to come to me as I have...okay too heavy for a day before the day before a vacation!!!  ALOHA!
