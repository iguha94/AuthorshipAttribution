So there's this guy Bobby who goes up to Boz's, (my Cheers).  I've met him a bunch of times and he is friends with some people I play pool with.  I would call him an acquaintance at the very least.    Bobby is scrumdiddlyumptious.  One of those people that you just want to put in your pocket and take out once in a while to look at. But then he opens his mouth and you think to yourself "thank God you're pretty".  Upon first introduction to Bobby, him and I proceeded to flirt with each other and in true high school form, Stacey's mom gave him my  number "for me".  Yea, that was quite embarrassing given how drunk I was.  That was months and months ago.  The next time I saw him I laughed it off with him and since then I've seen him a few times and we've exchanged pleasantries.  Here's the thing...he's Jailbird's brother.  Through writing for the last 7 1/2 years I have come to realize that a couple of the people I know at Boz's know Jailbird.  I also would run into his ex roommate's girlfriend there and we've talked.  So I knew that there were some connections between Boz's and Jailbird. Now I'm just a tidge embarrassed that I tried to mack on his brother.  Not to mention the fact that Jailbird is totally jealous that his brother hit on me.  Most of you won't understand why this is all so funny to me but it's something noteworthy in my world.   Just another reason why I think Milwaukee is too small!!!!
