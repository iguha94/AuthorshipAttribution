Argh.  I'm tired today.  I was in bed by 10pm which is earlier than most nights, however I had a few beers last night and didn't sleep all that well.  I had a disturbing conversation with JB after I left the bar and now today I have all those stupid feelings of insecurity and doubt that I thought I had already gotten rid of.  Yes, now I remember why I was single for so long, it just seems easier.    I had a lot of fun last night...got chased around the bar by a 20 foot long centipede that Stacy's Mom had caught...ran out of the bar paralyzed in fear.  I tried my revenge to pick her up and carry her ass out the back door...but instead received a spank on the ass from Shawny for getting rowdy in his kitchen.    RyRy tried to make me feel guilty for some reason that I'm still not clear on what it was.  Old School filled me in on her date and for once had some input to the conversation when it turned to the topic of "men are scum".  I also had unexpected conversation with an old friend...reminding me of what I miss.  Made me wonder what again the problem was??  So here I sit Tuesday morning wondering why it is that I can't just pick up and fly off to Australia on a whim whenever  I  want to.
