This morning I was so very tired, for the first time I didn't care if my clothes matched.&nbsp; I also didn't care if I wore underwear, so I didn't.&nbsp; I came in to work and actually got complimented on my outfit.&nbsp; Maybe I should get dressed half asleep and hung over more often!   What is it in men that makes them feel as though they must fight when challenged?&nbsp; Alcohol involved or not?&nbsp; Last night I had an experience that I honestly do not recollect ever facing before.&nbsp;   I ran into an old "boyfriend" while I was out shooting some stick last night.&nbsp; We talked on and off throughout the night but given our history I had to make it very clear that I was seeing somebody and he needed to lay off.&nbsp; I mean I'm flattered hearing "You're incredibly gorgeous" and "You are so hot tonight" every 2 minutes, but c'mon buddy leave the wandering hands at home!&nbsp;   This was all well and good until the evening took a wrong turn.&nbsp; As I was fighting his hands that he couldn't seem to keep to himself, I laughed and told him to stop in a semi-stern tone.&nbsp; As I said this another gentlemen who'd been playing pool&nbsp;came out of the bathroom and told my old "boyfriend" to lay off of me in not so nice terms.&nbsp; Thank you very much sir but I can handle myself.&nbsp; Well one can only imagine where this went.&nbsp; I actually had to stand between them and yell at them both that it's not 'effin worth it and they should both knock it off.&nbsp; As soon as I stepped away my old "boyfriend" extended his hand to introduce himself and make peace with dude.&nbsp; Instead dude&nbsp;decided to be a total cock and push him as he shook his hand.&nbsp; Drinks went flying, sandals landed across the bar, and the two of them landed on the floor pummeling each other.&nbsp; This went on for atleast a minute before the bartender and others got involved and pulled them off of each other.&nbsp; Ay-yay yay....I just stood there shaking my head.&nbsp; Fucking machismo.
