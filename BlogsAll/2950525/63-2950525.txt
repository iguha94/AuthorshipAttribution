I don't want to hear about how many fucking t shirts you are selling in Houston, I don't care how much fucking money this new website is going to make you, I couldn't give a shit less about how many fucking phone calls you got over the weekend.  Congratulations BH on your website and Hold 'Em items that are selling like hotcakes, I'm fucking glad you are on your cell phone closing deals like crazy, but I have fucking work to do.  You're running a business out of your home, keep you fucking work there and quit causing me problems here. You're the VP for God's sakes, how about some fucking professional behavior jerk off.  I just walked up to our swear jar, plopped in a dollar and said "fuck fuck fuck FUCK".  I don't feel any better.    My stress level is rising today.  I swear sometimes I cannot work with BH to save my life.  He interrupts me every 5 minutes (seriously, I'm not exaggerating) and most times it's for the stupidest reasons...like he needs to know at this exact moment who's attention an order was shipped to.  Like that was important enough to interrupt me while I'm sorting through some complicated project.  Jesus Christ.  And then he wonders why I have 16 things I'm working on at once...well duh!  Fuckin A I can't wait to get the fuck out of here for a week.  Breathe.
