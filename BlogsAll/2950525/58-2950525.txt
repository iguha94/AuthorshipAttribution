Sad magnet face today.  I am officially single again. Not a bad thing.  Not a good thing.  Just a thing.  I had my "final" talk with JB last night, told him I had to say goodbye.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  I then proceeded to go out and have a few beers and stay out too late.  Went to Sully's to meet Kit Kat and Algebra Challenged and a bunch of people for some chica's birthday.    I got hit on at the gas station on the way there, some dudes on some crotch rockets.  I was tempted to throw caution to the wind and ask for a ride like the old days of cruisin' hwy 100 in the Double G or my Mustang, that we so named "Speedracer" in honor of my own nickname.  Then at the bar I gave my number to 6-pack for some unGodly reason...cuz he asked?!?!  That's a phone call I won't answer.    My newly-single-not-so-much-a-brother-Matt (I must shorten this), Clay and Chris all came out to meet me and hang out.  Clay will now be referred to as "Slightly Stoopid" as his shirt showed off the name of some band that  I've  never heard of, from long beach and in the styles of Sublime so I've been told.  Anyway, thought of the day:   People are like boomerangs.  They drift out of your life but are surely to come back at some point.  You have to love them while they are here.
