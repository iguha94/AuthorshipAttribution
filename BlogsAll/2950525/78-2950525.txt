Here's a tip for all you knuckleheads out there like me:&nbsp; If you are at home for the evening and tired STAY HOME!&nbsp; I went out at 10pm last night, which normally wouldn't be that unusual however on a week night, this is not a good idea!&nbsp; I managed to close the bar last night and though I was not drunk, 5 beers and 2 shots was all I consumed, I am still extremely tired today and feel like I smoked a carton of cigarettes.&nbsp; We played umpteenmillion games of pool last night and folks I was on FIRE.&nbsp; I made bank shots that I didn't even think I could see let alone actually hit my pocket.&nbsp; On numerous occasions I found myself jumping up in the air as I watched the awesome shot I had just made.&nbsp; Winning was definitely in the cards for Funquita last night.&nbsp; This and all the male attention we received proved for a late night.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Won all 3 in volleyball last night!&nbsp; Yay us!&nbsp; Of course it helped that the team we played against seemed to be all the kids who got picked last in 7th grade gym =)&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very disappointed in my friends though.&nbsp; I called 11 women last night and could not find a single one who would come play with us...we played with 5 short a girl and still rocked.&nbsp; Kit Kat and I had some fun in the sand and Nutter Butter and Jeffy narrowly escaped a head on collision.&nbsp; All in all fun was had by all, I think.&nbsp;   Finished the poem, not sure if I'm going to post it or not.
