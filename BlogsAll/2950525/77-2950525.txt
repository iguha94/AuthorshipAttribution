I sit at my desk barely able to function today.&nbsp; What is going on?&nbsp; I am so incredibly tired I feel like all life has been drained from me.&nbsp; Yesterday was spent rollerblading and lounging around Kit Kat's until I was ripped from sleep by "Big Pimpin" blaring from my cell phone.&nbsp; I headed home and watched "Heartbreakers" and then headed off to bed at 10pm.&nbsp; I read my book until I could hold my eyes open no longer.&nbsp; Was it the pain pill I took at 9 that has got me so groggy this morning?&nbsp; Who knows, but it sucks cuz my ass is not getting anything done.&nbsp; I have the attention span of a gnat at the moment and it doesn't look like it's getting much better.&nbsp; These are the days I wish I drank coffee, cuz at the moment I think I'd shoot myself straight up through the vein!   This weekend was filled with craziness and crappiness:  Found out Big C has a Big Crush on me.&nbsp; Drank for 12 hours Friday.&nbsp; Straight from work, do not pass go, I charged out of the gates throwing back beers at Sluggo's until 9:30.&nbsp; Genius idea next?&nbsp; Head to St. Terese with Slight Stupid, Jeffy, Big C and&nbsp;The Foreigner.&nbsp; Super Freak met us up there but she missed our scuff with the Po Po.&nbsp; Five adults ranging from 27 to 29 all pretended like we didn't know you couldn't carry in cans of beers to a church festival, oh yea, we had those cops convinced!&nbsp; Funqi was quite buzzed as she decided to smoke something other than her cigarette that night as well.&nbsp; Aye aye...after heading to the bar for a solid 3 hours, we returned to Jeffy's...after I, yes I drove.&nbsp; Slightly Stupid was slightly drunk (highly usual for the man who is never without a cooler of beer in his truck) and somehow I was elected to drive because I had waved at a cop car....wuahat?&nbsp; 2 plus hours later, grass stains on my knees - get your mind out of the gutter I was trying to tackle Big C in Jeffy's backyard and well if you've ever met Big C, he's B-I-G!     Quote of the Night: &nbsp;    "Gettin' wood, backing away" uttered more than once by GolfPro after attempting to dance with me.     &nbsp;    Highlight of the Evening:     Winning another Nutty Monkey from the stuffed animal claw!&nbsp; This one is fuzzy wuzzy and soft with a "sweater" that says Heart Golf...that's right, a heart and the word Golf, not I heart Golf, but heart Golf, this was so perfect and only took me 5 times.&nbsp; Unlike the Popeye I won for Bumpy that took me a quick fitty cents.     &nbsp;    Funniest Moment:     Chad spilling his beer right&nbsp;down the front of my shirt but not spilling a drop ON the shirt.&nbsp; A river runs through it as the cold liquid makes it's way down my chest and tummy soaking the top of my pants.&nbsp; Nice.      Crappiest Moment:    Walking in&nbsp;to the bar only to be greeted by Jill, SuperFreak's&nbsp;arch enemy.&nbsp; After giving me a grand hug and making a big production of seeing me, her friendliness quickly turned cold when she realized how good of friends SuperFreak and I are.&nbsp; Not to mention that all the guys were more concerned with us, then them.    &nbsp;  Saturday was not quite as eventful but so much fun nonetheless.&nbsp; La Fuentes left us feeling exposed and margarita relaxed.&nbsp; Relaxed enough to discuss our feet and pull them up to the table barefoot...I'm sorry I forgot I'm not a monkey and  do  know how to act in public.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there were the attacking birds!&nbsp; Ah, La Fuentes, wehre the margaritas go down like candy and the waiters look like candy.&nbsp; Mt.Olive rocked that evening and honest to God my ears are still ringing from standing next to that God Damn speaker!&nbsp;  You think I'd stop there?&nbsp; Nope, went and scooped up Freebird for a finish to the evening.&nbsp; Ended up at StepSis's pad for the bbq, a little late at midnight they were still up throwing them back (I know this surprises you ;))...cuddled up under a blanket by the bonfire and I learned things I hadn't know about my Free Bird.&nbsp;   Amidst the craziness of this weekend I managed to accomplish none of the things I had wished to.&nbsp; I'm lazy, oh well I've come to accept this I suppose.
