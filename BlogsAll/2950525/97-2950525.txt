         Dragged Funquita up North with me to a friend's housewarming party.  We drove 2 hours, sat on the couch for 2 1/2 hours, and drove home.  These people were the most unwelcoming, unsociable people I have ever met.  So what if we didn't grow up in the same hick town and know them since we were in diapers.. JEEsus!  Anyway, we came home and were passed out by 10:30.  On a Saturday night.  I'm blaming Friday night's rendevous for that.   We did make up our very own rendition of "Because I Got High", though.  Very impressive if I do say so myself.  Funquita's in charge of  posting them, stay tuned.    Had a dream about Him AGAIN last night.  What is going on?!!?  He and I were at this party, thrown at my place (which was much larger than it actually is).  I was talking to this girl I work with and he came up behind me, put his arms around my waist and rested his head on my shoulders and started talking to her.  I was irritated, thinking he was flirting with her because she was black.  Even though he has never dated or been interested in a black girl before and we weren't 'Together' in the dream, so I really had no reason to be mad.  I leave the room, go talk to other people.  On my way out to the balcony I see him across the room.  He looks at me.  My shoulders drop, defeated, I just shake my head and look away.  I lean over the balcony and he come up beside me.  Very close.  Our shoulders our touching and our arms are overlapping.  I look the other direction for a few moments before deciding I should quit being so childish.  Ask him a question (how have you been, or something like that) and he answers with a big story.  He's smiling while he's telling me this and we're making direct eye contact.  He suddenly interrupts himself mid sentence and kisses me.   And then kisses me again.  And again.  Then we walk inside, somebody stops me and he disappears again.  That's all I remember.  Weird.    I need to get some shit done today.
