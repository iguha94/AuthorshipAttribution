I got the sweetest text message from JB this morning.  Before heading off to bed last night he sent me a text saying "nite sexy"...mmm I love being called that.  This morning I awoke to "I love your sexy smile".  I don't know what he's buttering me up for but I like it.    He's one of those men who uses lots of pet names.  He calls me Tootse, Sugar, Baby, Sexy and Mama.  Tootse is cute, but gotz to go cuz my mom calls me Tootse.  I like Sugar, but that's reserved.  Mama is a little too ghetto for me.  This leaves Baby and Sexy.  Both are fine choices.  He's doned me with the nickname Monkey, which is very fitting considering I'm already Nutty Monkey.  And I've found that he likes to say my name.    I like to call him Short Fry cuz he's 6 foot forever and towers over me.  Honey and my Dear are about as creative as I am these days.  I have more fun making up silly names for people rather than using terms of endearment.  Somewhere along the line I have taken to calling him Sweet Cheeks but I'm tiring of that expression.    I'm completely rambling about nothing right now and ya know what?  I don't care.    I have a half day of work today.  I'm going to lunch with my mom.  I'm signing a lease on an apartment today.  I'm going to a movie with Kit Kat and most likely going out to celebrate my newly single not so much a brother Matt's birthday, (provided S is going to be out).  I've got family crap Saturday afternoon as well as Sunday and Saturday  night after bellowing out some karoake at Flashdance's house, we're all heading out to see Mt. Olive.  I won't get to see SweetCheeks until Sunday or Monday night cuz he'll be in Green Bay, but I think I'll make it.  Although I am still a little perplexed as to why the invite hasn't been extended as of yet.     So I'm off to do some work now.  AMF!!!
