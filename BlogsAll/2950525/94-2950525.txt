Why do I keep getting sick every couple of months? I never used to get sick. I went through high school with mostly perfect attendance except for the 9 day bout with mono my sophomore year. I only remember missing school in grade school when I faked a stomach ache to get out of a test or something. But now that I'm old, I get a bad cold that lasts a week or 2 every other month. Sometimes the cold lingers for weeks and I never really get rid of the cough. I take One a Day Vitamins and Vitamin C every day. I drink 3 bottles of water a day and I usually avoid people who are sick. But yet cold's seem to find me. Maybe it's this crap weather we have, hot-cold-hot-cold....rain-sun-rain-sun.  On the plus side, I haven't had a cigarette since Saturday, yay me. I haven't died yet and according to my psychic and tarot card reader this was the year. I've got 4 1/2 days to make it through to my 28th year...I think I've got it handled. My brother didn't have his surgery yesterday or Monday, it's now rescheduled for next Monday. Nice, thank you VA for scheduling my brother's brain surgery for my effin' birthday. Not like I had any plans anyway, but still. Argh.  Here I sit at work wanting nothing more than to go back home and crawl under the covers with Teddy. Turn on the tv and watch Three's Company reruns until it gets dark out. Where's my chicken soup? Somebody bring me my chicken soup! ='(
