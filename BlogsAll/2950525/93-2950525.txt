Aloha - Hello-Goodbye Mahalo - Thank you Honi Honi - Kiss Wiki Wiki - Right away Howly - White person 2 Hawaiian minutes - We'll get there when we get there Hang Loose - Party on =)  I don't' even know where to start.  I am so incredibly relaxed and stress free.  People on the islands really know how to make you feel like nothing in the world matters but chillin' out.  I can't believe I came back...we should have missed our shuttle to the airport.  We should have missed our plane.  I could handle another bunch of months in Hawaii.    I fell in love twice this last week.  Once with Hawaii and once with my Navy boy.  Mmmmm, I wish I could have packed his 6' 3" frame into my carry on and taken him back with me as a souvenir.  After 3 hours of solid conversation and a few beers, we went swimming in the ocean under a full moon and walked hand in hand along the coastline while being pursued by men of the law =)  I couldn't have asked for a better end to my vacation.  Who knew you could fall in love in just one night without tons of tequila and mind blowing sex!  All it took for me was a few beers and sweet kisses.    Today I am in recovery mode.  Trying to get myself back on Milwaukee time...that 5 hour time difference is a killer.  I partied last night since I was wide awake and had nothing better going on today.  I'm fighting not to go back to sleep for a while...I tell ya, the only thing I missed on my trip (except my friends of course!) was my cloud.    Oh I've got lots to tell ya'll, to be continued...  Aloha!
