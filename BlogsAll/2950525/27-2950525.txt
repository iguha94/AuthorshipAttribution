It came to me in a dream.  There was a girl there.  She was from my past.  She told me she couldn't be anymore.  Then she walked away and I never saw her again.  Then I was in a room that was bare except for a picture of a boy I once knew.  Except he was older and worn by the years.  I couldn't stop staring at the picture.  I caught my own reflection in the glass and realized that I was old too.  My hair was grey and my skin was wrinkled.  My eyes told a story of lost loves, missed opportunities and joy that was never seen.  There was a tear in the corner of my eye and I realized that I was dead.    life is meant to be lived and enjoyed.  When I see  my reflection in 30 or 40 years I want to see wild grey hair and laugh lines, my eyes should be full of life, things I've seen, things I've done, joy I've experienced in friendships and lovers.  My smile should never fade and my head should always be held high.  I woke up in a sweat this morning and reached for my dream dictionary.  All the hair on my neck was standing up and as I got up from my cloud I had to steady myself before standing.  Dreaming of dying is one thing, dreaming of being dead is a whole other.
