I'm damaged goods. My heart - It won't work right.  You see, I'd really like to love you,  But it's putting up a fight.    It seems I lent it out to someone once, And never fully got it back.   I was blind,  He was selfish,  And he broke my heart in half.    I've tried to piece it back together.... And sometime's I swear I've healed, But the moment you try to get too close That tape will start to peel.   So if you wanna be with me, Be prepared to just be friends. Because it's not fair to let you care Until my heart can fully mend.    I'm a hopeless romantic:  I fall in love fast, I fall out of love fast.  I generally have my whole wedding planned before our second date.  I've been truly in love Twice... the 2nd time was the first time I laid my heart out on a silver platter and, well, not good results.   Ever since then I have had a hard time getting into a relationship.  Every time I think I can love someone, they run away.  They aren't the kinds with staying potential anyway, and I think I subconsiously choose those types b/c deep down I don't want to be in a relationship.  Every time a perfectly nice guy tries to love me, I seek out every fault of theirs until I can't stand to be around them anymore.  I'm trying to be patient because I'm certain there's 'That One' out there for me... but sometime's I'm worried that I'll never quite connect with anyone like I connected with the one who got away......
