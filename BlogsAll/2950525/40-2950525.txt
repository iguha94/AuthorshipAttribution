I got to work at 7:54 this morning.  I grabbed an emergency fed ex and headed out the door (815am) to College and Howell to drop off artwork.  I came back to work (9:30) and headed into a meeting that took an hour.  I headed to another meeting (11:00) that took another hour.  I went to lunch (12:30).  Now here I am having to do some actual work and I can't concentrate.  I think I have adult ADD, I mean seriously.  I get distracted so easily and always feel disorganized.  I wandered the building after lunch for no real reason other than I didn't feel like coming back up to my desk.  Now I've been here about ten minutes (1:40)  and started 4 different tasks...and now look what I'm doing.  Writing here.  I must compile a list of things I need to do before I go away this weekend.  Considering tomorrow is our party, I've got to get it all done tonight.  Argh.  And to think I've been doing little things all week to get prepared but yet I still have a ton to do.  Laundry!!!! Clean bedroom Clean basement Stop at Boz's to pick up volleyball check Make physical therapy appts.  Laundry Paint nails Sally Hansen's for hair product Highlight hair Clean golf clubs in case JB indeed decides he wants to golf this weekend. Go to bank to get cashola since dummy me has seemingly lost my debit card.  So what have I gotten done so far?  Half my room is clean, I cleaned out vacuumed and got my car washed and freshly changed oil.  I've bought the wedding presents and wrapped it all up.  I've got my dress, shoes and jewelry all picked out and ready to go.  The hotel reservations have been made and I printed out directions/maps to get there.  I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  Speaking of forgetting things, I'm like having an asthma attack and I forgot my inhaler at home today...swift.
