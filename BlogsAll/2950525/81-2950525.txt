The Top 5 Reasons Port Washington Sucks:  5.&nbsp; I don't know my way around.  4.&nbsp; My cell phone doesn't work there.  3.&nbsp; Their festival closes at 10pm.  2.&nbsp; TRAFFIC leaving their festival was like the Brooklyn Bridge at rush hour.  1.&nbsp; Did I mention I don't know my way around?  &nbsp;  Fish Days was rocking Saturday evening when we arrived at a useless hour of 9pm.&nbsp; Thinking we'd have a couple hours to enjoy some music and beers, little did we know that this festival of fish closed down after the 9:30 fireworks.&nbsp; The party was rockin' when we got there.&nbsp; Set at the marina, they had what I counted as 4 music stages and tons of people milling around.&nbsp; Had I not been on a mission to find Freebird, we may stopped to enjoy some of the festivities.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fireworks were mediocre at best but this is definitely an event I will surely check out next year.  &nbsp;  Following this road trip gone from a 1 hour total drive to an hour and&nbsp;a half because of the Where's Waldo directions I received, we went to Boz's for Jay's birthday event.&nbsp; Holy shit was that place packed and packed with people I knew from past and present.&nbsp; Walking in to that place was somewhat of a time warp.&nbsp; First I talked with a girl who was part of my life 3 years ago and&nbsp;we spent 20 minutes trying to figure&nbsp;out just HOW we knew each&nbsp;other...&nbsp; Psycho Angie.&nbsp; Then a bit later I ran into another flash from my past.&nbsp; I hadn't seen this one in easily 7 years.&nbsp; Still as ditzy as ever I was still excited to see her.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  And of course I got to see Freebirds yummy brother.&nbsp; This was the first time I'd seen him since Freebird and I figured out that I knew him.&nbsp;&nbsp; This world is just too small.&nbsp; How was I supposed to know that his brother hung out at MY Boz's.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean jeez the last time I had seen him before that was at Freebird's apartment for his bro's  18th birthday!&nbsp;  How was I supposed to know he was so hot and that when I met him I'd be wiping drool of my chin and trying not to jump on top of him?&nbsp; He's dumber than a box of rocks but those um...eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; He kept telling people the story about how when we met months ago he thought I was hot and we talked and I gave him his number and that it's funny that I'm his brother's ex and have written to him for the last 8 years. &nbsp; I was flattered in an odd sort of way that he was telling people (people who knew me) this story.&nbsp; Crazy how Will and Poppy and Dena all know Freebird.&nbsp; Saturday was just an odd night.&nbsp; I swear there had to be a full moon.&nbsp; I didn't get home until 4:30 in the morning...when's the last time I did that?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Friday night was a lot of fun too, Mt. Olive rocked as usual at the fest down the road from home.&nbsp; CPA, Kit Kat, Teaser, Roomy, DorkBoy, WhiteTrash and Dancer and I all walked the 6 blocks and set up for a fun evening.&nbsp; Afterwards I found myself on my way to Maverick's with Dancer to meet some of her work buddies.&nbsp; Mavericks?&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Walking in to that place was like walking in to my past again.&nbsp; Having spent many a drunken Thursday stumbling around that bar.&nbsp; Playing darts so drunk I can't see the board, chasing beers with shots and vice versa, hanging out in power outages, yanking people's pants down, letting the bartender take pictures of me flashing the bar - oh wait after having somebody (not mentioning any names here) pulling my shirt up for me so he could take the picture, being pushed around the pool table after being doused with a glass of beer thrown at someone else, pulling my cuz out of the men's bathroom so we can leave, breaking up fights between her and whatever girl she pissed off, devouring tacos that tasted like heaven after 3 pitchers of beer ....memories.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not quite so much excitement this time around but I was amazed to walk in and have Todd remember who I was.&nbsp; "Hey Lisa!&nbsp; Nice to have you back honey!" was the greeting I received.&nbsp; I did a double take as I found it hard to believe he remembered my name.  &nbsp;  Having had a weekend where my past was pretty much my present I've been reflecting on how many years have gone by that I've forgotten.&nbsp; People that have been cut or fallen out of my life.&nbsp; People who's lives have touched mine and I've touched theirs.&nbsp; You don't realize what kind of an impact you have on people or vice versa until they have been gone and resurface into your life.&nbsp;&nbsp; So many experiences I've had and places I've been.&nbsp; Highs and lows.&nbsp; Good times and bad times.&nbsp; I can't ever imagine living a different life.&nbsp; I've loved a lot of people along the way and am finding out that I've been loved more than I could have imagined.&nbsp;  &nbsp;
