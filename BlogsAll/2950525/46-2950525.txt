I am so dumb, well atleast I'm the best gf EVER.    I'm walking out of work around 5:30 last night when Mr. President himself calls me into his office.  That's usually not a fun thing.  But this time he offered me our season tickets to the Bucks game.  Pretty much on the floor, right where the players come out of the locker room.  I declined?!?!?!?!!  "I've got pool tonight" I responded.  HELLO?  I took the tickets anyway promising that I could find somebody to give them to so as they didn't go to waste.  Oddly enough JB's name was not the first that popped into my head.  Luckily I recovered fast and realized that duh...I have a bf now, he's supposed to be the first person I think of in a situation like this.  So I called him and told him to find a friend cuz he was going to the Buck's game.  HELLO? Why am I not going to the game?  I'm not exactly sure what my deal was here folks.  He's going with Painterboy and I'm happy with this.  He stops to pick up the tickets and he's appreciative of this.  I bid him farewell and to have a good time.  After he leaves I send him a text message to stop and see me after pool if they decide a drink is in order. I watch the game at pool...Buck's pull it out and the last 3 or so minutes of the game were probably the best.    JB sends a text saying that Painterboy has to work in the morning and they won't be stopping...frowns all around but oh well.  He also informs me that they left with 5 minutes left on the clock....JEEZ.  I later find out that they went to a bar after all...jerks.  Show some mf'in gratitude.    Why should I be salty?  I mean duh, I should have just gone my damn self!!!!!!!!
