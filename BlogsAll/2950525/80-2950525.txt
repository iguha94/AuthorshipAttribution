Begin Rant  &nbsp;  After having her new Dick (aka DorkBoy or DancingQueen) stay the entire weekend, I'm very annoyed with the boy.&nbsp; He's such a dork and I don't mean a good dork, he's the kind of dork that in high school, even I would have picked on.&nbsp; He's annoying, not obnoxious like I am, just annoying.&nbsp; He has already made himself at home and decided that it was okay to walk around the house in his towel after he took a shower while&nbsp;Roomy slept.&nbsp; Hey Dick Wad, put some fucking pants on, it's just not appropriate nor comfortable for me to have to&nbsp;be subjected to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also felt comfortable enough to fuck around in the &nbsp;kitchen cutting up fruit and making a fruit salad for the picnic they were going to the next day while she was still napping, do you have a home?&nbsp; Oh my God, he's been around for a week and a half and he's ready made himself quite at home.&nbsp; I think I saw an extra toothbrush in the bathroom this morning?&nbsp; Then I awake to a note on the kitchen table...yadda yadda yadda, I'll be home around 6.&nbsp; Eric's coming over for dinner...um hello doesn't he have a home you two could go to?&nbsp; Jesus, was that a hint to leave or just a warning that he'll be there.&nbsp; $100 says he will stay the night AGAIN.&nbsp; Every time they have seen each other he has spent the night.&nbsp; Maybe I should invite Freebird over for movies and dinner.&nbsp; I get home at 5.&nbsp; We can have the whole house taken over by the time they get there.&nbsp; Nope, instead I'll probably make myself scarce cuz they annoy me.&nbsp; Argh.&nbsp; Shoulda moved out when I had planned to.&nbsp; &nbsp;  End Rant
