The folowing explains why certain people make me want to take them and shake the hell out of them.  I have a friend, a person I have been friends with for almost 3 years.  I don't ever remember ever having this person apologize to me or take my feelings into consideration when she treats our friendship with total disregard.  Due to recent events and the below text taken from a recent email, I have decided to go tell her to eat a bowl of fuck (words taken from my good friend NB).    I can't make it on Friday.  I completely forgot.   (no apology, you forgot and made other plans-therefore you cancel on me it's okay to be inconsiderate)    As far as volleyball  - I was pretty much thinking it wasn't going to happen with all the drama and changes going on.     (what-the-fuck-ever I asked you if we should have D be the replacement or if we should find someone else and we agreed to find someone else, this was only a couple weeks ago or can't you remember that far back?)     C said she isn't going to play this summer and G asked me and N a month ago to play with them so I'll probably just do that this year.    (oh, it's okay that you just decided to quit the team and not tell me.  oh yea and it's okay that you are bailing to go be on another team.  It's okay that you punk out and don't seem to give a shit at all.  apology accepted)    .
