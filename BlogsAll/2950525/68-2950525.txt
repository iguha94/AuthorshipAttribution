"CAKE FIGHT" someone screams amongst the chaos as I get a handful of cake smashed into the side of my head.  My reaction?  A handful of cake thrust at the 12 year old who trashed my hair with frosting and bits of chocolate cake.  "Thwap" was the noise it made as it crashed against her neck and stuck to her and started to slide down.  The other one stuck her hands in the cake and squished the frosting between her fingers, where that cake landed I don't' know.  But my next endeavor was smearing my frosting covered hand all over her face and neck, making sure I rubbed it in real nice.  It started as a playful joke.  I was helping Stacy's mom with one of the grad cakes and as I turned to set it down on the table it started to slide of the platter.   I made a quick recovering but in the process my 4 fingers ended up stuck in the side of the cake.  My other hand had grabbed the other side as the cake smashed into a cabinet. But I saved the cake with minimal (or a little above minimal) damage.  I was squatting down laughing so hard I almost peed my pants.  Luckily everyone was laughing with me instead of getting angry!  In a playful gesture I took my frosting covered fingers and swiped them all over Dale's face.  Ha ha ha right?  Apparently when you've got a bunch of 11 through 14 year olds in a room, it's not a good idea to smear frosting on someone's face because before I could say boo the kids had their hands in that cake and declared a cake war with me being the target.  I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life.  Cake on my legs, my shorts, my shirt, my neck, my face, my hair...but it was Yu-u-u-mmy.   12 DAYS!
