i hate it when you let yourself go with someone despite every thought in your head telling you to stop.  canoodling with a stranger is something you do when your the ripe age of 21, kissing some boy in the bar seems like the thing to do.  then you hit an age where it's not but it still happens.  on that rare occasion that it does it's exciting, it's fun and it's delicious.  until the inevitable happens.  he asks you to come home with him, your ex walks in or worse, his ex walks in.  me, my luck, all 3 events simultaneously occurred.  so close on the dance floor i could   feel   the question coming as I spot my ex watching me from a nearby booth.  i pull him off the floor back to the table as i plow over his ex.  I'm battin' a thousand here.  she turns to berate me for spilling her drink and instead starts to cry as she sees "her" man holding   my   hand.  he dismisses her and kisses me hard.  whispers in my hear that he wants to take me home and well...use your own imagination.  i'm appalled and know my face shows it as my ex saunters up to say hello.  meanwhile this girl is still standing there crying and swearing and asking "who's this whore?".  if i cover my eyes will they still be able to see me?   scanning for the quickest exit, i try to wriggle my way out of dude's grasp.  luckily Teaser walks up and grabs my arm to pull me on the dance floor.  Thank you so much DJ for playin' my song =)    As for the dude, he went home alone that night...although i'm sure he had a late night visit from water works.
