Why do we always want what we can have and then when we get it we really don't want it as much as we thought we did?    This is the heart of all my frustration in life.  I spend so much time chasing after things I think I want and then once I obtain them it doesn't seem to matter quite as much.  Then I just go after the next thing and nothing seems to satisfy me.  Is this what it's like for everyone or do I have some sort of a problem?    Yesterday I didn't go swim with Kit Kat cuz I had to walk around with my new contacts for a while and then wanted to go see JB since he had been gone all weekend.  I got over there and wanted nothing more than to walk down the street to Kit Kat's and have a swim and to have our 80's reunion karaoke in the pool.  JB just got on my nerves and I didn't want to be there.   My good friend and long time car fixer upper Dave called while I was there and Mr. Possessive got all kinds of inquisitive... who's Dave? an old friend how do you know him? met at whitnal park  did you guys date? 10 years ago for all of about 8 seconds etc etc...  omg I do not do well with that!!  Now when my girlfriends call I don't get that kind of interest.  So here I sit at work today pondering the reasoning behind my never quenched thirst and my never full stomach.  Always in search of the next "high" and wanting all the things I am unable to have.    Things I learned this weekend: I cannot escape my past. I cannot follow my heart. I cannot be what anyone else wants. I can hide from my past. I can be patient and wait for things to come to me. I can be me and be wanted for just that.
