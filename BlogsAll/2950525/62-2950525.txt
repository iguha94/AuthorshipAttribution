3 days and so much to do.  I spent most of last night in bed coughing and sneezing and chasing my runny nose.  I should have been sleeping but I decided to flip channels and finish my book.  Then for some reason beyond myself I arose and went down to the computer.  I needed to download all the pictures on my digital camera so I could clear them out for my trip.  I also needed to make a disk for CPA.  There was 105 pictures on that thing.  So I started to fold the laundry as I waited and started a load in the washer.  By the time I was done dicking around on the computer with other things I had folded half of my laundry and had a load in the dryer and one in the washer.  Jeez...now it's 10:45 and I've got laundry going that should really be finished lest it be wrinkled in the morning.   Went to bed instead.  Couldn't sleep.  Wasn't tired anymore.  Then when I did fall asleep I coughed and sneezed myself awake again.  Tired as all get out today.    I've got to shoot pool tonight as Smiley had his appendix taken out in emergency surgery yesterday so I'm the sub. Tomorrow I've got volleyball and summerfest.  Do I bail on Summerfest?  We'll see how I feel I suppose.  I'm going to the doc today to get on some heavy antibiotics.  I think I have bronchitis, I think I'm dying.    Aloha.
