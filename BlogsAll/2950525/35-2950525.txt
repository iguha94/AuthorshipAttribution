Things went very well last night.  I feel so much better about things.  It's amazing what a little communication can do for a person.  With plans to go to Bartalota's for dinner I was really nervous about what I was about to do.  We ended up at Saz's and I felt much more comfortable with this.    JB is one confused man.  He refused to let me tell him goodbye.  Insisting that that's not what he wants I enjoyed the ego boost but in my mind I knew I couldn't do what he was asking me to.  I told him we had to say goodbye and he told me he was still going to call me.  We'll see what happens, atleast I've got some clarification as to what he's thinking.  He's one of those guys who are in fight or flight mode with their own feelings.    I made him stop at Boz's on our way home so I could drop off my volleyball receipt, let him wait in the car while I ran in and made my rounds saying hello.  It was a little scary, 3 people asked me what I'd like to drink, the bartender already had popped open a bottle of beer for me before I was able to say that I wasn't staying.  It was crazy that on Friday when I went up to get a beer Shawny asked me if I planned on paying my tab...MY TAB.  I had forgotten I even had one!!!  I'm soooooo glad summer is almost here...get me out of the bar!  All in all I'd say last night was a very good night and today I feel much better.  My roomie's gone for 2 weeks...anybody want to come to a party?????
