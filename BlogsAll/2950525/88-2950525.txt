I've come to the conclusion that I suck.  And I'm not talking about the kind of sucking that involves swallowing afterwards.     My desk looks like a war zone over here and I can barely keep up with the stuff going on, but yet I spend 25 minutes writing on here and then come back for more.  Also for some reason my personal email use has seemed to triple since I've been back.    I've got 3 job "offers" on the table right now.  One that's been in the horizon for a couple months but is approaching decision time.  One that I will learn more about on Tuesday, but from what I know the pay is great and the  people are even better (sha-right).  The third is an opportunity that would take me to California but I know I'm too much of a chicken shit to follow up.    I suck cuz I'll probably stay here cuz I'm settled.  I have tired of my job here however I am too chicken shit to do anything about it.  I suck cuz I talk of getting out of here but never do.  I suck cuz I don't know how NOT to spend money.  I suck cuz I have the attention span of a gnat.  I suck cuz I am the queen of procrastination.  I suck cuz I am not motivated.  But mostly I suck cuz I am in love with the unattainable.
