The last two days have been exhausting.&nbsp; So proud of myself on Wednesday as I was prodded and peer pressured to come out after my boyz played softball. I needed to get up at 5:30 on Thursday to meet the VP for our golf outing.&nbsp; Knowing my boyz all I could see was a night of drinking, drinking and more drinking.&nbsp; Having drank many 40's before their game and multiple cans in the stands and parking lot, I knew continuing the night with them would have proved to be a drunken haze.&nbsp;   Hitting a new low loss of 18 to 7, they had their asses handed to them on a platter, summed up by Wes's genius analogy  "The only thing cooler than that loss, is the cooler of beer!"    In the end I was a good girl and home in bed by 10:30, yay me!   I shot a 102 yesterday, not bad for the course we played.&nbsp; I drank Par Punch until the rains came and ate a dinner fit for a queen, including apple baked chicken and terriyaki beef with beans.&nbsp; Yum!&nbsp; Then my stuffed, drunken, sleepy self traveled home for a quick cat nap before volleyball.&nbsp;   Ending up having to play a double header, Funqi headed home ready to collapse around 10:45pm.&nbsp; We won all 6 games!!!!&nbsp; And laughed our fool heads off for much of the game, between our girl Blondie " I've gotta make sure the saline's back in place"&nbsp;  and Jeffy's failed attempt at a spike (much reminiscent of Nutter Butter's whiff last year) we still managed a 6-0 slaughter against the 19th Hole.   Yes yes, work piled to the ceiling and eyelids half closed, I've got lots to do so I can get out o here on time today.&nbsp; Okay concentration is now a must.
