Ever feel like you just need to laugh but there doesn't seem to be anything to laugh about?  I think I'm in a funk.    I go through these stages where everything in life is fun and makes me laugh.  I go out and laugh and let loose.  I smile at everyone and give hugs and kisses to my friends.  I feel like everyone's my best friend and I appreciate the hell out of everyone.   Then there are these other times where nothing makes me smile, my current funk.  I walk around with a scowl on my face and people avoid having to talk to me.  I go out and for the most part sit around just staring at people wondering why they are having a good time and I am not.  I start feeling like none of my friends even like me and I'll never find the one to share my life with.    Maybe I'm schizo, or maybe I just need to eat more iron.   Tonight I have a feeling that my plans are going to fall through and I'll just end up sitting at the homestead.  Although I am getting better at regaining that independence and am okay with spending time with myself.  I actually bladed by myself last night.  It's funny.  Each time a relationship ends I go back to surrounding myself with people and I can't seem to do anything alone.  But it passes and I again realize that nobody knows that I was just rejected and I CAN go out in public without ridicule.  Random thought process today.  I think I'll have a V8.  Ciao bella, see you in heaven.
