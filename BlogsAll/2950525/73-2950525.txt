Lie (noun)  1.  A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood.  2.  Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression.    Why do people lie?  It's such an unattractive quality to have.  An ugly trait that I despise.  People tell lies all the time, white lies, half truths and bold out and out lies.   I tell white lies or half truths on occasion to spare someone's feelings, but I grew out of my days of bold face lying when I realized that there was no point to it because it just hurt other people.  I think it's a great sign of immaturity. The thing I hate the most is to be lied to by someone who CLAIMS to be my friend.    What's even worse than that is when you catch somebody in a lie and they tell ANOTHER lie to back up the other one.  Do you think I'm stupid, gullible or a pushover?  The dumbest of liars are those who tell a lie that is easily revealed with no effort, like when there are other people who are inadvertently involved in the lie and aren't aware.  It's amazing how quickly the deceit is revealed.    Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.    It's sad because the more somebody lies to me, the less and less I trust them and the more and more I step away from them.  I can't respect people who lie to me on a regular basis.  I can't even listen to what they are saying without wondering exactly what the truth is and wondering when exactly it's going to be revealed to me.  I give trust from day one, I hate taking it away and I will forgive many a time before I do, but when I do, it's gone.
