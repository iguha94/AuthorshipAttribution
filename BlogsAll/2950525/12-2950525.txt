I have "volunteered" to work on a committee to develop a newsletter for our customers.  Not only do I have the honor of writing marketing strategies and stories to put into the newsletter I also have the pleasure of deciding which products to highlight each month.  How exactly I got entangled in this endeavor I am not sure.  We were asked for volunteers and somehow during the silence that ensued, all eyes turned towards me.  "Lisa you're so good at ASI, Matt (Pres of Co.) was really excited for you to take on a role in this project.  He spoke very highly of you and thinks you'd be an asset with this project....blah blah blah."    This went on as I debated in my head.  How do I say no when the President wants me to do it?  How do I say yes when I know all the work that it will entail?  So instead I kept quiet watching the others squirm...all the while knowing I was going to get roped into this... as our manager pleaded with her eyes for two volunteers and explained to us how important this was.  Finally a volunteer, my good friend Patti took some of the pressure off.  But by golly they were determined to have two volunteers...by many twists of my arm and much protest on my part I have taken on yet another role here at Teuteberg.  Volunteer my ass.
