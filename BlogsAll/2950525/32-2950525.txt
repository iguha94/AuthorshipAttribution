I'm sore from who knows what today.  My throat is dry and scratchy from yelling last night.  Went to a Marquette game and yelled my arse off.  Damn refs need glasses.  I decided to save myself the humiliation of getting beat at pool and getting drunk afterwards and then coming to work hung over as all get out.    Well half my plan worked anyway.  After the game I went to the bar anyway to say hi.  Well 76 drinks later I went home.  The plan was to stop up, have a couple beers, play a game or two and go home.  Little did I know that people were going to crawl out of the woodwork and invade my party for 1.  Just how many shots of cherry bomb can one person consume?  I'd count for you but let's just assume it's somewhere around 14.  I made a new best friend.  Her name's Tiffany...Tiff for short I've been told...and she has all of about 3 brain cells.  She's your typical Barbie doll, pretty, skinny and blonde who much to my surprise is a total sweetheart.  It's nice when somebody tells you they think you're awesome upon your second encounter with them.    can you hear me over that loud drumming????  Oh wait, that's just my head.  ... I'm addicted to Cheez-Its.  Every day around 9:30, I purchase a 50 cent, 1.5 oz bag of Cheez-Its.  220 calories, 12 grams of fat and 23 carbs and the bag makes the claim that it contains 100% real cheese.  They are yummy.  Yes, I'm addicted to Cheez-Its.
