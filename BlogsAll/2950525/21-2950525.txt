Religion is a touchy subject among certain people.  Ever since I saw "Passion" I have been noticing different things about the way people react to my "interpretation" of the movie.    When I state that even though the movie was based on a story I considered to be fiction it was very powerful and moving and made me think differently and question my views; certain people make a point of rebuttal, stating "it's a true story".  Stating this as though it was fact.    So I counter and point this out..."You believe it's a true story and I believe it's fiction."  I get "It is based on true events".  "That is what you believe" I counter again stating the person's beliefs rather than facts.    How does anybody really truly know whether it happened or not.  When speaking of religion I make a point of putting a disclaimer on all my statements, beginning them all with either I believe or I consider as to not push my thoughts on other people.  But I have found that people who are religious and believe what the Good Book teaches tend to push their thoughts and beliefs as fact.    If religion teaches based on a system of beliefs and faith, why is it that it is often toted to non-believers as real true hard fact?    I believe that there is a higher power in the world that is a driving force behind all things.  Is this one superb being, I don't know.  Could it be? Yes.  Given all that is tangible in our world, is it likely?  Probably not.  I'm not about to tell anybody that what they believe and have faith in is based on fiction and I expect nobody to tell me what to believe either.
