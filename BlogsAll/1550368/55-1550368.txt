          aaarrrrggggg!  I just  totally  disapointed my kid! Gawd, I suck!!   See, we had made this "spill" -- white glue, tempra paint, flour and an Odwalla bottle -- and it was supposed to take  48 hours  to dry and  Boo  was going to her  CP's  house for three days and so we had this  BIG  plan for me to take the spill with me to work (today) and to bring it when I went to go pick her up from  CP's  house  tonight  so she could  pretend  she'd spilled her odwalla in her room and we could watch  CP  freak out... which is a GREAT plan except  CP  called me last night and said she was going to bring  Boo  to me in  Oakland  and I said  o.k.  and didn't TELL  Boo  and subsequently came to work sans "spill" and  Boo  JUST called me all  excited about the trick  we were going to play and I had to tell her that 1) I didn't have the spill with me, 2) the plan changed and I didn't tell her and 3) since I didn't have the spill here with me the  soonest  we could play the trick is SUNDAY which is  AGES  away and now she is  completely  disappointed and sad and it's ALL my fault!!!!!!!! Add to that the fact that I tried to make her feel better by saying "Well, how about this. When we get home I'll play frisbee with you..." to which she replied in an insanely tiny, wounded voice "Will you play with me more than you  usually  do?" AAAARRRRGGGGGGGG! Me=SUCK!!!!!
