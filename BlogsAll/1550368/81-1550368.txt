          Ugh.  Here it is my  favorite day  after my   favorite  day  of the year (we  get  an hour, yeah. Baby!!) and I'm still tired. Granted i have NO leg to stand on viv a vis  why  I'm tired (and  achey  and the tiniest bit  hung over ) since I had a  great  week-end, but still... I'm  exhausted  right this second.  Shout out to  Pretty Boy , thanks for treating me to one of the  most expensive  plates of  pasta  I think I've ever eaten, and thanks for taking it completely in stride when I inadvertantly ordered a  bottle  of the  Chateau Syrah '97 instead of a  glass  (  Loser  =me!) You're one class act, my friend and you just get more and more adorable!  Didn't mention it on Friday but I had my  butter-Boo  here with me at work for part of the day and she was just GREAT! She sat in on some very boring, very long, very  confined  meetings and was a   trooper   throughout! Yay,  Boo , we wuv!  Also big shout out to the fabulous  Miss Tail  who is carrying more than  her fair share  of the  flirtatious duties  (see  Chick's   bonehead interaction  with  cute girl  below). I have always felt that the world  needs more flirting  and I am delighted you have managed to so completely  carry the team  this week-end! I, myself, have thought long and hard about what my damn deal is and have, as of yet, come up with  nothing  so you may be playing all the positions for the next little bit.   TIA  , you rule!
