         Blah! Work  sucks  today! My various  bosses  are all  freaked out  over some  HUGE  scheduling thing that i did (with their  approval  I might add!) that apparently  threatens the fate of the free world  or something equally heinous...   Anyway, just to give a little overview of the new rant structure vis a vis the " key players ":   Boss #1, 2 & 3  have been  dissolved  as  functional entities . Instead we now have " Head Honcho " being my direct supervisor here at   Sniff  , " Tampa Teddy " being the guy in charge of the   GlobalGroup   troops (coincindentally also being the one making my life especially difficult right now FOR NO REASON!!!), " El Torito " (aka Boss #2 ) being my "team lead" and primary contact with   Leech-Land   and finally  Todd . Boss extraordinaire, head and CEO of   Leech-Land  . For those of you keeping track,  Boss #3  is no longer my boss but remains  my bud  so we've come up with a shiny new monniker just for him --  Elephant Princess  (Not "elephant" meaning in any way to imply that he's  heftier  than most but "elephant" as in "the elephant in the room noone is talking about" and "princess" just cause... well,  if you know him you'll see why this just sooooo right) ... K. are we all up to date. everyone set? Good.      Tampa Teddy , you   SUUUUCCCCCKKKKKK  ! {breathe out} There. I feel much better now.
