          The Queen is dead! Long live the Queen...!  Quick Quiz -  When you hear the term "Blow-out" which is the first thing that pops into your head:  1)Flat tire 2)Par-tee!!!! 3)Hairstyle (as in "using this new instant shampoo will add days to your blowout!"  I was reading this   magazine  and there was some recipe for "saving your  blowout " and I have GOT to say i went looking for  party tips !!   {shakes head} I just don't think I'm their target demographic.  Anyways, so {settle back in chair, get cozy}.. I'm as big a fan of the   goddess made flesh  as anybody and let me JUST state right here and now for the record that if  Ms. Jolie  showed up on my doorstep tomorrow demanding a spit shine i'd be on my knees before the "Nnnn" met the "I"  but , having watched   If These walls Could Talk - Part II  last night (I know, I know, it takes me a minute to get to things sometimes...!) I am so firmly in the    Chloe Sevigny   as all that  makes life worth living  camp that quite seriously, I'm  no longer sure  who would win out in a "pick one from the jello-filled wrestling pit and commence to making out" type contest were I the  judge ... And it's not  just  that she ( Chloe ) is BEAUTIFUL, it's that she's  dressed amazingly !! We're talking silk ties, linen pants, garbadine shirts -- mmmmmmmmmmmm..... Why are girls so beautiful??!! Why are they so completely, decliciously perfect in every way?! See,  THIS  is why I have to stay away from them! It like an addiction... Where are the  AA meetings  for recovering Lesbos, that's what I want to know!!  {sigh} I  was  going to go on and write some more about gay culture and assimilation (there's a mini-raging debate over at   NP ) but I've lost all my energy... maybe later...
