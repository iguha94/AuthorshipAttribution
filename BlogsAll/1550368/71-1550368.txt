          And the hits just keep on coming...!  Hallo folks, let's see what is there to say this morning...? week-end was lovely. Bagels with the  Bees  - always fun;  Boo  class = great (there quite literally is not a single thing in the world more adorable than 6 year olds doing acrobatics)!  Boo's new/regular teacher  is fabulous in a  butch kind of way  and if I was in the mood for it, I think I'd add her to my  crush list . I'm not though so she'll have to stay in the land of "cool people who I only really consider when I'm in their actual presence". Not a bad place to be, actually -- I'll bet the  vast majority  of my crushes might actually prefer to be switched to  that  list...!   Anyway. Spent yesterday working on the  loft project  with the amazingly sweet  R-B Guy  -- thanks you soooo much for everything, my friend. Hope you find what you need from life -- and it looks great! we made this AMAZING  railing  for  Boo's bunk bed  that is a freaking  work of art . The loft's not done yet but it's getting there and it's much less close to  falling down  so I'm happy.  Aside from that nothing else to report (at least not anything that needs to be aired in public) ... OH! Except that the plans for the  Boo birthday  are shaping up nicely so be on the look-out for your invites; coming soon to e-mail near you!
