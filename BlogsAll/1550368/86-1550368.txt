          I think my soul is old  I'm sitting here staring at a   West Elm  catalog and I'm thinking I have a theory about  those people  who like having one stick of  brushed steel furniture  with a  single oversized book  of prints made during  Picasso 's blue period lying  slightly askew  atop it as their  sole living room decoration . I'm thinking maybe they're  new . Like maybe their souls are  fresh  and  new  and just got here and haven't really had a chance  to look around  and become attached to all the  diverse trappings  of a life well lived. Maybe they feel better with the  one or two items  much like some very  small children  become attached to a single "fluffy" and that's all they need. I'm thinking the same thing about people who like their things all  shiny  and  new  and  pressed . I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it I just think it's interesting that  new things make me nervous  while they make other people  feel more secure . My  Baby Brother   loves  new things.  CP  makes an honest attempt to keep anything she purchases as fresh  as the day she removed the shrink wrap . Me, I look for things with stains. I just got a new pair of shoes upon which I just noticed the first  scuff . I am thrilled! Anyways... just thinking about stuff before I go to class and have to think about other stuff. Cheers and all that. Hope everyone has a spectacular day....!
