          Comments   Alrighty then, how's everyone doing? Good? Good. It has recently been suggested that the " comments " area of this blog is insufficient in that it is too damn tiny and "that nobody reads it anyway." Now, I for one,  love  the comments section primarily because when a  loyal reader  does deign to  actually type something in , it's usually pretty funny (what can I say, it would appear that I am surrounded by people who are  witty to a freaking fault !) thing is, not alot of people seem inclined to use the  comments functionality  more than sporatically. NOT that this is a problem. I'm all about the rambling  on  and  on  and  on  until someone calls the  cops ... What I  would  like to know though is  IF  I were to figure out a way to make the comments slighty  more accessible  to the  general reading population  (a task which may or may not involve a move to a whole other  blogging system ) would any of you be more likely to  leave your thoughts ? Conversely, if I left it the way it is but took it upon myself to  periodically post  those insights that, in my humble opinion, were particualrly apt/made me  fall out of my chair  would that suffice? Furthermore, do we think it would be my  moral obligation  to  notify  the individual  before  making their comment  more  public or is the fact that they  left it in the first place  enough to get me out of any  potential legal situations  vis a vis making those thoughts a bit more apparent...? My  initial impulse  here is to establish a "comments" area where I can copy and post any  related notes  that strike my particular fancy while still leaving the full comments section for persons to explore should I forget/not have time to regularly go back and edit past postings.... What do we think?     K. Next. A super big shout to my splendid ex-co-worker buddy  SAH  who is currently frolicing in the sunny, bohemian climes of    Ann Arbor, MI  , who checked in this morning to say that all is well and who I miss terribly! This whole "you-working-somewhere-else" thing? I  don't think that was such a good an idea after all.... So, you be coming back, when??  Actually, along those lines I wandered in this morning  completely sad  that I haven't had a chance to check in with my  boyz  who are actually located right around the freaking corner! (Damn  new job responsibilities ! Damn  school !) Luckily the always adorable  Tony  stopped by to remind me of my priorities and I was able to squeeze in a visit with not only his fine self but with my super-favorite  Sir J  as well!   Sheesh. I've got a freaking lot going on right now. It's nice that everything seems to be falling into place but still....     School. Love school. Still hot for  teacher . After class on Tuesdee,  Prof. K.  suggested we get together to discuss "what I wanted to get out of her class" to see if she could "help me with anything" eh, hem... The aforementioned  tete a tete  happened yesterday and will  happen some more   on  Monday  since I was late ( dur! ) and she didn't feel like we had enough time to  really get into  the various ideas she had for "helping me advance"...! Sigh. I heart her. My  Wed. class  went well as well.  Berk. Teacher  is a bit scattered but fellow  students  are cute/smart seeming and I like roaming around the campus -- although I am SOOOOO taking  BART  from now on. It costs in the nieghborhood of  12.00 - 15.00  to park over there for one freaking 3 hour class!! Bastards! Anyway... I had a  ton  of reading to do and  two little papers  to write which I actually did so I feel pretty on top of my game (right this second. Check back with me in a week and I guarantee you, I'll be flailing...!) One of our readings for the class was/is    Bone Black   by  bell hooks  and I have got to say, it didn't really strike me the way I thought it would. I mean,   this  is pretty indicative of the type of review I associate with this particular memoir and I was really very excited to read it but, I dunno, it just didn't stike me as all that brillant. I mean, maybe I'm not  aware  enough of the time/space/issues that she's writing about to understand how powerful her living through them was but on some level, I guess I expect a writer to anticipate that.... To be perfectly honest, I responded to this book the same way I did to    The Bluest Eye   -- I LOVE  Toni Morrison , I wanted to love this book, but I just couldn't get into the writing. I dunno. In a way I feel like a  bad feminist  or something but at the same time I have  no problem  getting completely into any of several (all) of  Milan Kundera's  books not because I know any more about  communism in Prague  than I do about the  South during the early part of the century , but with  Mr. Kundera  I don't  HAVE  to know anything about the locale. The way that man puts words together to describe feelings/impressions is  nothing short of genius  and it never occurs to me to wonder if perhaps someone else might be getting more out of the text than I am....       In other news,  Big Brother  is driving out tonight from New Mexico for a little visit and to participate in a   triathlon .  I, for one, am  thrilled  that he's coming out onna counta I heart him very much. I'm a teeny bit confused however as to how exactly one  watches  a triathlon -- given the various wide-ranging components...? Ah, well, I'm sure it will all become clear in by  Sundee . Also arriving via plane will be the luverly  Missus Bro  and the  Squirt  whom I will be squiring about all day on Sat. Yay! I am fairly positive that much fun will be had by all.     Last and certainly least, here's some   political    crap  you'all might be interested in....    *                                                 *                                           *                                                 *    sick of writing documents wrote: comments??? How about full on discussion board!! Time to post some inflammatory stuff and have at 'er. People should leave their names, or be an "anonymous coward", much like slashdot. Time to start some word wars...    Chick wrote: Ha! and here's me thinking I've been inflammatory all along...!    a loyal hockey fan wrote: I'm loving the comments section. Are they moderated, or do they go straight to production with no usability review? If not moderated, I'd basically be free to vandalize with whatever propaganda I see fit. Anyway, in terms of the Bush recall effort, those people approached me at a peace rally in February. It bothered me at the time because I think even poor decisions must be suffered through. I've watched many (failed) recall efforts come and go in my home province of BC. They're the same every time, big press release, big news, gether some signatures, less press, it dies off and fails to attract enough attention before the deadline. We all shake our heads and wonder why we suffered through it. The Davis recall appears to be a different story. It looks like it's really going to work. Scary stuff.
