          The king is dead! Long live the King   Or rather the  President . Today  i  am the  President  because my kid put a  stars and stripes sticker  on my hand and  informed  me that I was. So, my  first line of business , I'm thinking is a nice long  nappy-nap  in the  Lincoln Bedroom . After that I'll see about  balancing the budget , making education  our number one priority  and getting the troops the  HELL  out of  Iraq .   Speaking of which (the Presidential sticker, not the troops -- besides which, was anyone else surprised by the fact that a "troop" is a single person...? For the vast majority of my life I thought "troop" was plural like a "Boyscout troop" which is composed of many children, anyway...) I'm wearing this  stars and stripes sticker  on the train today and I notice a "radical type" glance at it then at me and I actually felt uncomfortable. Like I should  take it off  so people don't get the "wrong" impression that being that I  agree with  or  support  anything currently going on in this fine country of ours but then I thought "Hey! It's  my  country too, dammit!" So I've decided to take the path currently being blazed by our own  Elephant Princess  and join in the fight to   "Take back the Flag!"   Who's with me (!!), show of hands...!
