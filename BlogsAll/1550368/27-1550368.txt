          Howdy!  I just sailed in here three minutes ago. BART sucks! Anyways... have not yet had coffee so I'll keep this short. My  Dads  and my  niece  are coming to town for a coupla days in just a bit and I'm sooooo excited! I did the  full-on  bathroom clean-up (which involved  bleach  no less!) last night and tonight I'm going to throw down with some vacuum attachments and a little  spic n span ! That's right people, watch my dust!...er...ah... I mean  lack  of dust... oh whatever...   In other news, my truck got broken into. At least the camper shell part of it.   What they took: a pack of  toilet paper , a bag of  potatoes  and some clothes washing  detergent . (No, I do  not  live in my truck! I went shopping for  supplies  and was too  lazy  to take everything inside...)  What they  did not  take: my  tent , my  tools , my  radio , the  money  in my glove box, my kid's  library books , my kid's  float-ey toys , yet  another  container of clothes washing  detergent  (I guess the thieves had a brand preference) and my  electric pump .  They  did not  break my window, they did not leave the campershell door open and they did not otherwise trash or destroy anything else. All in all, I'm pretty o.k. with the whole situation. If nothing else, it's a nice little kick in the pants to get me to clean out my damn truck!  Oh! and I just remembered they took some  magazines  a friend had given me (Martha Stewarts'  Living ,  Real Simple  and  Lucky . Now, since even  I  am not witty enough to comment on the buckets of irony inherent in their selections, i'll not even try.) Bye now. I'm off to find a cup and some joe.
