          Kids today!  So, last night, I'm at home, making some   sup sup  , washing a  dish  or two and I hear the  kid  in her room playing "school". I peek in and she's got some  animals  lined up and she's explaining some  concept  to them but the  big floppy rabbit  isn't interested so  "Miss Honey"  has to get  authoritative  on his furry little butt and explains to him (in a pretty stern voice) that if she can't get some   attentive listening   pronto  Mr. Bun  is going to be warming the bench for the first five minutes of recess! Now this is scary even to me so, of course,  Bunny-Boy  straightens up and the lesson continues. Now the  reason  I bring this up -- the reason I select this  particular instance  of my kid's adorability to relate is because the  lesson  for the day is on "interrelated concepts". "This is a  Ven diagram " announces my  six-year-old  kid drawing some circles overlapping each other.... My  professor  drew a "ven" (sp) diagram in class the other night and  hand-to-god  that was probably the  first  time I've  heard the term . Sheesh! Seriously, if that kid was tall enough to reach the  Cheerios  my continued existence in her life would be  completely  obsolete!     Thanks to our  Travelin' man  for the primo suggestions re: small circular tins! {rubs hands together} This is all coming together soooo nicely!    K. hat's it for now, I'm sneaking out early to try to get my  Trick  on so   Happy Happy Hallows   to everyone! hope everyone has as much fun as it's possible to have without getting killed or evicted!
