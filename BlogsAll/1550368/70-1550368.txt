          "Web meetings" - Informative or grossly generalized waste of time? Discuss...   I am currently participating in an  on-line meeting  that is attempting to explain to me why  Marimba  technologies is vastly superior to  SMS . So far I've learned that I can:  "enable complex systems while reducing human intervention for administration   integrate rather than change the environment or process  capture your business requirements and policies  enforce the policies and report against compliance  allow you to take proactive steps toward cutting costs"  I've learned this through a series of power point templated slides that progress at a rate of one every  6 minutes ! Ooops, hang on, apparently we are now going to learn about a "paradigm shift"... I mean, seriously , I could have gotten this from a brochure and at least it would have been glossily packaged! Criminey!  "Closed-looped, policy based management" What the hell??!  K. nuff of that. Big shout out to  the girl I like .  Thanks for the check-in. You're sweet. You're also quite safe as I have no intentions of moving to the  Portland  area anytime soon. That plus the fact I've once again given up on  adult relationships  pretty much ensures that anyone peeping into your window in the middle of the night (much as you might  wish it to be  me) is, instead, just some random stalker.  My GAWD could this "presentation" be more  boring ?????? Were you aware that  SMS  is  not  a policy-based system? or that it manges Windows and NOT your environment (Dur??) O.K. sorry. Just because I'm having to sit through this nonsense does not mean you should have to also. Although... what's that thing about misery loving company...? Anyways, I'll write more later after I've digested the  Marimba  sales-pitch...er...ah... I mean information offering!
