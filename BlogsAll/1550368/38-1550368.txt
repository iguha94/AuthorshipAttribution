          Nothing to see...  I don't have anything particularly interesting to write about this morning so instead I will make another  short list . This one is of  some of the things  that made me  happy  yesterday:   Having  lunch  with the ever-fabulous  Ms. Q   Getting to see  Tony  all  dressed up  and cute looking in his snappy "living-an-actual-life-outside-of-work-that-requires-looking-nice" outfit (especially the  shoes ! The shoes were  Sweet !)  Demanding that  Mistah Lovah Lovah  bring me  chocolate  then having him actually produce said chocolate within one minute of the demand time. (I think he's got a stash... I may have to raid his desk one of these days while he's down south  screwing with the   cows  )   Hearing from the ever cool  Starbutt  who's currently  trying to exist  way up in Seattle-land  Hearing from  Pretty Boy  who got some    JOB   and now is too busy for his closest (well, maybe not  closest ), oldest (o.k., so,  technically  not oldest  per se ...), most drop-dead gorgeous-est (Ha!) friend in the world!  Getting the check-in from the  ultra-splendid   Miss B  who I worry about sometimes,  trapped  in that house with just the  babies  and the  voices  ...(not really.  Miss B  is  beyond  capable -- I just have this ever-present  urge  to take her out, out, out! Since I cannot, I will instead buy her  cute shirts  that are perfect for a  hot  mom out and about on a  hot  afternoon...)  and, fresh from this morning's living   Finding out that the soooo cool, ex-co-worker  SAH  just got moved to a place where he can now  instant message  me throughout the day (Whoo Hoo!)  What a Wonderful Life!
