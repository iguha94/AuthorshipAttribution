         Whoo Hoo!  Dirty Boy  is going to have lunch with me! He says he's not going to kiss me anymore because 1) He's getting all committed to some   other girl  who's  not  me and 2) He's still got his panties in a twist about the   cold sore reference  but whatever. He's easy on the eyes and I needs some distraction right this second.  Sux though, cause with the  new schedule  not to mention the other random creeping signs of total disinterest, I don't think  Beautiful Boy  is going to kiss me anymore either. (!!) Where am I going to get my kissing from?! Oh, well, I hear that there are moments in real life where kissing just doesn't happen. Perhaps we will explore  that  for awhile.  In other news,  LC  and crew are going to be hanging with us in the park on Father's day which will be nice.  Lanky Canadian Boy  is going to try to be all upstanding n' shit cause he wants  Boo  to respect him. Ha! He says he's not going to drink or swear that whole day. I personally think it's sweet  of him to think it but im also going to be ready for the hasty exit should his life suddenly necesitate a chronic binge. Hey, I've seen the photos/video, I know how he gets. ;-]
