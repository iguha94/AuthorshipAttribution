          First a moment of silence...  For the governor that once was:   {...................}   and a heartfelt vote of hopefulness that the new guy doesn't further screw everything up! You go, Guv! Good luck!  K. So, I'm kind of honestly thinking that given that a "record" number of  peeps  were motivated to  vote  and given the fact that having this  particular bozo  in as the requisite "republican" will alleviate the need to elect a more "politically oriented/conservative" one at some later date, I don't feel the need to complain all that much. I mean, we DO live in a  "democratic" society  and if the  vast majority  of people surrounding me  honestly think  this guy can do any better than the last one, well then so be it. At least people felt empowered to voice an opinion [however ill-informed and stunning in it's inability to see "the big picture" it may have been], and that's what we all wanted, right? Right?? Eh, hem...     In other news, THANK YOU,  Dirty Boy , my  sweetest , most  wonderful-est   boyfriend-for-life  (except not  really ... BUT I would have to say you are  extremely well positioned  to "get some" pretty much  on demand  from the  Chickster  for the  rest  of your natural life although, given that, it is too bad you've recently become " exclusive " with the ever cute  OG . Ah well, such are the vagarities of fate...) You are the  best  and I am honored and amazed that you saw fit to give   me   a  ticket  to see    Mr. Lyle Lovett   {shriekkkkk!!!!} in  concert  , in  Oakland , at the  Paramount !!!! My life is already full of  amazingly fabulous things  and the fact that you managed to pull this out of your...er...ah...  thin air , is nothing short of  frosting  on top of the  frosting  of the cake that is my life! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! I owe you big time (take careful note, good readers, The ever-lovin'  Chick Magnet   will  put out for  Lyle Lovett  tickets!) Sigh... we heart....
