           So,  Mr. Lovah Lovah  was discussing  random, disgusting things  with a  buddy  of his (at  work , as is his  wont ) and the conversation drifted around to the following lofty subject:   “Which would you rather have posted to the internet - pictures of you passed out drunk with  [Specific degenerate friend of Mr. L-L]  “ defecating ” on your face or you passed out drunk with  [Specific degenerate friend]  “ reaching orgasm ” on your face.   Apparently the little circle of respondents was divided as to which was more categorically discusting.  Two  of the boys and  all  of the girls chose the salt bath.  Mr. L-L  elected the  feces . One respondent also mentioned that the girls probably chose the "emmissions" because they were “ accustomed  to it.” This is where I came in.   Chick  (4:18:56 PM): cuz they're used to it???! what the hell kind of  misogynistic ...?!  Chick  (4:19:31 PM): see, that’s  exactly  why girls won’t go down on you people. You have to convince them  that it’s a good thing  Mr. L-L  (4:19:42 PM): hahahahaha  Chick  (4:19:57 PM): you should  enthusiastically  choose the cum because it's soooo  great  and  tasty  and  healthy  and it  makes your skin glow   Chick  (4:20:04 PM): then they'll be more interested in the act  Chick  (4:20:16 PM): dummy  Mr. L-L  (4:20:45 PM): that is true  Mr. L-L  (4:20:46 PM): lol  Chick  (4:21:45 PM): i'm telling you, you need to talk to me  before  you go having these types of conversations with your friends  Mr. L-L  (4:21:51 PM): hahahaa  Chick  (4:22:19 PM): and why exactly did it have to be  [Specific degenerate friend of Mr. L-L]  performing the act?  Mr. L-L  (4:22:55 PM): cuz  [Specific degenerate friend of Mr. L-L]  is the one that will take pics of himself mounting us guys when we pass out drunk...  Mr. L-L  (4:23:01 PM): it's funny to him  Chick  (4:23:12 PM): I see...  Chick  (4:23:49 PM): and you still pass out drunk in front of him? Should I be doing an internet search on you?  Mr. L-L  (4:24:20 PM): nope...lol  Chick  (4:24:37 PM): can i post our side of this conversation?  Mr. L-L  (4:24:53 PM):   NO    Mr. L-L  (4:24:53 PM): ok..maybe  Chick  (4:25:19 PM): what if I write some sort of  sensitive commentary  to offset your  philistine  viewpoint?  Mr. L-L  (4:25:37 PM): let me review it first  Chick  (4:26:07 PM): I'll censure it a little for my PG-13 audience  Mr. L-L  (4:26:11 PM): ok.  Chick  (4:26:18 PM): sweet!  Does  anyone  wonder why I can't live without this guy??
