          It's out!  My  Boo-ster  is a big, huge, splendid,  grown-up  girl and she has just   LOST HER FIRST TOOTH  !! Whoo Hoo! Good going, kid, you're the best-est!!    In other news: I am  soooo  gay! Forget all that  crap  I was throwing around in  previous posts ; I went home last night, had some noodles, watched my favorite   TV show , fell asleep and promptly had  a series of dreams  that would make a fratboy blush! I mean,  my god , it was like my subconcious had been saving all it's pennies for the day when it could embark on  an all out media blitz  championing  chick love ! wow. I'm still tingley. Anyway, I was all leerey and oggley at all the girls on muni this morning... I feel like a twelve year old boy. "Hey  cutie , what's  your  name..." Heh heh heh... (whew, though,  glad that's cleared up . It's no fun living in limbo land...)     Right, moving on. back to the  fabulous kid . Me and her are trying to go  camping  this week-end. I'm gonna head over to this sweet little site tomorrow and see if we can get a spot (fingers-crossed) then we'll probably hang out at the river for a few days then roll on back to the homestead Sundee morning ish.   Ahhh.... adventure. Relaxation. Peace and quiet. Trees. I'm going to be such a pleasant person to be around after this trip...
