          Sigh...  Quick, what's  the  sexiest thing a  hottie professor  can say to her student as said student slouches into her office seconds away from being officially late??  Bonus points  for anyone who answered: "I've been thinking about you!" team it with a  gorgeous smile  and we have  box-office gold , my friends!! Gosh. i just really like her soooooo much. She's sooooo  cute ! and little (i know i keep saying that but when a person clocks in at 5'2" ish there's not alot of peeps in the world who need to look up to her if you get my drift...!)  And it's not  just  the cute thing. it's the  voice . And the  hands ! the tiny beautiful ( short-nailed ) hands...! K. Sorry. I'll stop... She loaned me a  book !  Two  books from her  very own library . She pressed them into my hands, leaned forward and said with a  very  sweet smile "if I don't get these back, I'm going to come looking for you!" {dying!!} O.K. seriously. enough. Who wants to listen to me go on and on and on (and on) ... She's 46, she lives in  the East Bay , she's got a  son  -- she kept throwing around the "we" so I'm ash-uming there's a  hubby  in the picture -- probably been married for awhile, best friends but not really sexual anymore... Doubt if he'd feel particularly threatened if the  wife  developed this sudden "interest" in one of her students... at least, not at  first  -- Heh Heh Heh...(Ha! I wish!) She's all excited about me because she wants me to be a  City Manager . She says she'll be my "advisor" (Tee Hee!)! Jest let me know who I have to talk to, people! Time's a wastin'!!    Did I mention I'm giving up the  coffee ? Here's an exerpt from an e-mail I wrote to a friend of mine about it: "So, i'm jumping off the  coffee boat  and back into the  land of tea . i used to be such a COMPLETE snob about the  tea  vs the  poison ...er...ah... coffee  but I slipped into  corporate land  and apparently abandoned  every single moral and aesthetic principle  I had and well, i think we can all see where it's gotten me. BUT no more I say! No more reliance on the  brown frothy liquid  just to maintain some semblance of good nature; no more dressing in virtually identical "decent" neutral colored  tops  simply because they're clean and not torn and I'm too tired to care; no more "blah blah blah" about how I'll probably be here in  Corporate-land  for "another coupla years, maybe more, who knows" --  I  know, dammit! i will be OUT of here in  three  years, no longer! I will be  looking for windows  and massaging  policy wonks  in order to get my  urban educations needs  met. i will be  fast tracking  it toward  City management ! I will be wearing "smart", snappy separates with "fun" accessories! i will be a  freaking inspiration  and I will drink TEA!!!!!!"  Sheesh! I don't why some people even talk to me anymore....    *                    *                    *    shari wrote: Well, I'm certainly going to stop talking to you. No more coffee. Jeeesh !
