          Still tired after all these years  Why am I so  exhausted  all them time?? I mean, it may not be immediately apparent to all of you out in browser-land but there is  not a single moment  when the thought of my  beautiful bed  is more than three steps outside the perimeter of my usual musings. I was going to try to go  play some pool  tonight but right now I'm so sleepy  I can hardly stand . P'raps I will postpone the knocking of the balls around in favor of turning in early for some quality sleep-age...    Saw  Beautiful Boy  today. He cut his hair! ( Wait , what's that sound?? Ah yes, it is the sound of  angels beating their breasts  in lamentation as the heavens become a shade  less bright ...) Looks o.k. I guess... (If you like  short black pointy  hair. Not that there's anything  wrong  with  SBPH , all i'm sayin' is if you decide to trade  perfect  in for  trendy  or  cool , well, there are those of us asthetes who are going to feel a bit betrayed. That's all.)  Rock on with your short hair,  BB ! I'd still talk to you at a party...! Also slightly disconcerting is the fact that  Beautiful Boy  was toolin around in a tricked out Toyota that had "Persian Pride" written on the front window. Disconcerting because, for some reason, I thought he was a bit more "bike-friendly" and because I thought him and  Other Girl  were Mexican... P'raps there are  two   beautiful boys  in the world??? Could the  fates  be so  kind ?? ah well, I'm sure everything will be made crystal clear in due time...    Have I mentioned I'm tired? Sleeeepppp... sleeeeepppppp... k. I'm going to either find more coffee or a plausible excuse to go home. I'll keep ya posted....
