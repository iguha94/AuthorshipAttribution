          I am an idiot.   Cute  Boo  Teacher comes up after class today. Smiles warmly, extends her hand and says: "I just wanted to officially introduce myself. I'm  C ." I, being just as suave as it's possible for a  single human being  to be reply: "Oh. Uh. yeah. Hi. I knew that." I  knew  that??! What am I in "How to effectively curtail a conversation 101"??? And,   no  , in answer to those of you who are probably saying, "well, after that, you  rallied  right? You came back with something.  Anything ... right???!" Nope. I sat there. Another  parent  stepped into the  void  and commenced with an actual   conversation  .  Boo , herself stepped up and remarked that she "liked class today!" I mumbled something relatively incoherent, acted like it was some kind of freaking  chore  to gather together the assorted clothing of two  six year olds  and left. Gawd! Sometimes i am so unbelievably lame I amaze myself!     Miss Boo  is having a  playdate  right now with a child whom she  cannot stand . It's weird. This kid torments her pretty constantly at school but at the same time sometimes she's incredibly nice to her so our  Boo  is  conflicted . She was pretty excited about the IDEA of this kid coming over but the reality of the situation is that i have two kids in my house who insist on fighting about EVERY SINGLE THING the other says. Cute though because they also want to have the exact same stuffed animals, dinner plates and drinks as each other. Ah,  youth ! Anyways, they're getting along right this second (in a bossy, cranky kind of way) so I've been reduced to "figurehead" status. I feel a little like  King Solomon : "So, then you said what? And then what did  you  say? And what about that hurt your feelings? So. what do we need to do to fix it? K! So, let's do that then!" Hee Hee. Kids are weird -- not like us  adults  who are really  easy  to figure out...!
