          About...  Me, only, not really...   Living Arrangement:  Great house in the middle of Oak-town. That's right, no cool "practically in Berkeley" address for me, thank you very much! Live with one fabulous kid (most times) and two small cats which frequently band together into one big cat.   Favorite (non porn) Magazine:  The Sun. No lie, it's a remarkable, well-written, expertly researched magazine. and Maxim. Cause...um...well, you know...    Favorite (actually porn) Magazine:  Almost anything I'm in. Except for TeenBikerSluts (they made my butt look big).   Favorite Smells:  The ocean, my kid and fresh bread.   First Thought of the Morning:  Must continue sleeping, I wonder if I'll get in trouble if I call in sick  again  today...   Favorite Foods:  Noodles and gravy.   Favorite car:  Currently tooling around in a red Ford truck with a camper shell. I hate it and it gets sucky mileage but I look really good getting in and out of it so it stays.   Who I would want to meet:  Eartha Kitt, Angelina Jolie, Milan Kundera, Lyle Lovett (oh  please God , let me one day meet Lyle Lovett).   Favorite (non porn) Movie:  Slaves of New York (cinematic perfection -- kind of...).   Dream Job:  Something having to do with setting educational policy at a national level and people in high places kissing my ass.   Glass half empty, or half full:  No glass, just the juice, all over my workpants.   Type with Fingers on the Right Keys:  Yes. Unless I want to get things spelled correctly. Then, no.   Under my bed:  Crap.    Hair Products in Use Today:  Sebastian No. 9 -- I stand in awe of that simple orange liquid.
