          One down, one to go!  Well, that was fun. O.K. so maybe not fun, ha ha... Can I  just  say, if you're going to go out on a  date  with someone and you want to ask them about stuff that  when they answer  is going to provoke  on-going fits of nervous laughter , can I  just  suggest that you ask them over  e-mail  or during the  pre-date phone call .... Can I  please  just put that out there??! K. So,  date  was o.k.  Young Lad  was nice enough but a bit different than he initially "presented", shall we say... (Oh, my  goodness ! It would appear that the cute butch girl I smiled at on the street this morning is  HERE  for some sort of meeting...! well, hell-lo... Sorry, {focusing}where was I...?!) Anyway, ended on a  handshake  and a "Nice meeting you" then I was  off  to my snuggley, fluffy bed, to pay some much needed attention to my cats and to place an introductory call to Date #2,  B-R Guy , who BTW was awfully nice. He seems articulate and funny and I  think  he may be willing to indulge my  power tool fetish  so you know it's all good!! Anyways, I'm seeing him on  Sundee  after the peeps leave so we shall see what we shall see....
