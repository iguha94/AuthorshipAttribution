         Here's some news...  My   Caseworker  just talked to  Rosemary's caseworker  and the field of "potential families" wishing to adopt the little angel has been narrowed down to  two ,  me  and some  other shmoe . Which is  great ! However, he's still being all  feet-draggy  about answering general questions and giving more of an  indication  as to whether or not I'm going to be allowed to see  Miss R.'s  file... Then there's this  other  baby, newborn basically, who needs a placement " ASAP " according to the social workers but her  biological mom  hasn't decided what she wants to do in terms of  re-unification  so they're (the  caseworker peeps ) all talking about " concurrent  planning" which essentially means that you take the kid and in the event the mom does all the things she's  supposed  to in terms of showing the state she can care for the child, you release her (the kid) to the mom. Buh-bye. If the mom  doesn't  fulfill her obligations then you adopt the child. Nice, but I can't do it. I could  maybe  do it if I didn't have already have a kid but there's  no freaking way  I'm going to let  Miss Boo  get attached to this new person only to have her taken away. So... where does that leave us? Not much further than we were before, I'm afraid, but at least it  feels  like things are moving along, kind of.
