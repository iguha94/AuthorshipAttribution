         Quick  ad  update: out of  11 initial flurries  of stat exchanges and a  week-end  to digest ...  THREE  persons have stepped up to continue with the correspondence! Whoo hoo! One is, funnily enough,  Mr. Initially-Insipid  (or " I-I "), two is  Young Lad  from the East Bay who is keeping me in  freaking stitches  with his postings and three is a disillusioned  engineer/bike racer guy  who just told me he's "cool with my age" because he's into " older  women" ( prick !!) Anyways, of the ladies,  Scary Girl  was the only one I wrote back to and she has not replied as of yet today -- but that may be  my fault  because I  may  have been the one who was supposed to "follow up".... not sure. Should check.   So there we have it. I have scheduled  two  dates: one with  B-R guy  and one with  Young Lad .    I-I  and I have decided to wait until he returns from some alleged "business trip" before attempting further plans (which may just be a nice way of  blowing me off  but we shall see...)  For now, I must say, while I am a bit  disheartened  that some of my  original  picks (who were campaigning with some enthusiasm  last  week) have failed to check back, I'm not at all displeased with the conversations I'm having with the few who remain  in play  as it were. Good show,  Gentlemen . Let the games begin!
