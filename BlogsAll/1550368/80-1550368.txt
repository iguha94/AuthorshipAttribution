          Fascinating!  Well hello there! I am in a FABULOUS mood today (not sure  why  since i've been having to  WORK  all morning -- Bastards!!) at any rate, I had a  very  productive  date/advisory session  last night with the Ever-Hot  Prof K  and she gave me an idea for a project that while being  stellar  in and of itself led me this morning to an even  BETTER  idea that is just so   fabulous   I don't even think I can stand it! Really. I don't. I'm not going to say  what it is  or anything onna counta it's  highly marketable  and " the man " has spies everywhere but should I actually do it I'm sure most of you will be forced to make much of it so don't go feeling  left out of the loop  or anything. The Fabulous and Effervescent  Miss Bee  just sent some pics of her bubs (aka  children  you perverts!) and THEY ARE ADORABLE!! Now,  both  of the  Ms. B's  are pretty  easy on the eyes  but I still swear I do not know who they paid to get a  license to produce  such phenomenally  attractive childruns  but there you go. Life=wacky sometimes. {sigh} K. really just checking in. I have to get back on track with my  production duties  or else I will be   skewered   at the end of this week.  Ta fer now.... Drop us a line if you get a chance!
