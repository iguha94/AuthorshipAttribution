          Sheesh...!  I was completely  blindsided  by the  parental units  at Boo's school today. Man, they were coming at me from all sides... "Is  Boo  going to be able to make it to  Shaleta's birthday party  tomorrow?", "Do you have your  giftwrap sales paperwork  with a check made out to...?", "Hi! We're  new  and our daughter  loves  your kid and we want to set up a playdate! [note: During this particular incursion, I also had  Boo  standing there giving me the "Um, mom, THAT'S the girl I was telling you about who I can NOT stand!!" look]  Chick : Um, yeah, sorry, we're not really  doing  playdates right this second because my schedule's just so... well, YOU know how it is...! [I gots my Baby's back!]", Can  Boo  come to  Randy's party  next Saturday?", "Can I talk to you about  the dance class our kids are in ...?", "Can I give you a ride to BART???" I mean, My Gawd, people!!! We are just a couple of tiny  problemsolvers  in a  vast world  of issues. Damn you, eerily passed on to our offspring unbelievably charismatic personality traits!!  (Ha! sorry. I just really wnted to see that last bit in writing.) O.k. I'm better now. Off to meet with the masses re: some work thing that I'm ill-prepared to address effectively (thank  GAWD  I've got the world's most  talented team of people  working with me, otherwise I'd be  ska-rewed !)      Oh, and I also wanted to say a great big Thanks! to my beautiful  Professor K.  for advocating on my behalf with the powers that be at the   school  and getting them to not only alow my petition for special study but also to waive the late fee usually associated with such random flights of nonsense. We wuv! K. off now. more later maybe. We'll just have to see...
