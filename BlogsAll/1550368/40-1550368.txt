          Warning...  I’m in a  bad mood  today. I’m in a bad mood because my ex-girlfriend  pissed me off  yesterday. I’m in a  bad mood  because part of the  fall-out  from the incident that pissed me off was that  my kid  was pretty seriously disappointed and was sad all day. I’m in a  bad mood  because despite 8+ hours of  damage control  including a movie, ice cream, and riding bikes the  last  thing my kid said to me before she went to bed was “today was a bad day… But, I love you.” I’m in a  bad mood  because I was awake  all night  thinking about how  stupid  it was on my part to think that a  pleasant exchange   meant that everything was going to be o.k. and that we were all going to be able to  move the hell on  and acknowledge the good things we could still contribute to each others lives.… Whatever. I’m over it. I’m through trying to prove what a basically  decent  person I am to people who are  invested  in believing that I suck. I am  particularly annoyed  that I let my kid be dragged into it but again, all I can do is make sure it doesn’t happen again. Forget the  tiptoeing around feelings , forget the  hyper-awareness  of where I can and can’t go. I’m sick of  spending a whole bunch of energy  trying to be a decent person only to be accused of being (continuing to be)  devious ,  inconsiderate  and above and beyond all else,  someone who makes people feel like shit . If I  am  that person then good riddance, you should be glad I’m gone. If I’m not, then whatever, nothing I can do is going to change that perception and I’m sick of trying. I repeat. I am done.
