          Sorry...  I was just thinking about this one time in  high school  when our  drama group  took a trip to some other school for a  state-wide drama competition  [not only did we  not  win, at one crucial point in the production  our stage set fell over ] and I got all  incensed  because shortly after we arrived, I glanced across the lobby and  some girl  was wearing  my-then-boyfriend's  pin! Let's just say,  much   off-stage drama  ensued during which our mutual friends went to  great lengths  to assure me that the  pin in question  had "just dropped off" and that this girl had picked it up and that  MTB  was simply following her around in an effort to get it back. I, of course, didn't believe a word of it and retaliated by  pseudo-hooking up  with  the-world's-sweetest-college-boy , who was trying to stage manage the entire production, find ushers for said event AND field the other rampant females who were trying to score invites back to his pad [I was actually in the room at one point listening to him fend off some other chick who wanted to come in and "look around" -- I don't blame em, kid was CUTE] anyways... long story short, at the time I didn't think it was at all possible that that  pin  just  happened  to fall off and that that chick just  happened  to pick it up. Now though, in retrospect, I can see how it might have happened that way. Sorry, I thought you were a lying sack of sh**,  MTB . My bad.
