          First and foremost...  A  good friend  of mine who,  in addition  to co-parenting some of the  coolest  kids I've ever met and providing  sustained ,  kick-ass  spousal support of the  wifely  variety to the fabulous  Miss Bee ,  also happens to be one of the  best  persons  ever  to set foot on this planent is having a little  out-patient surgery  today so, just wanted to say my thoughts and good wishes are with you, pet! Hope it's no big deal, that you heal soon and that the hospital staff treats you like the  king  you are! Oh, and pinch a  nurse  for me, would ya...?    So, last night I finally got a chance to read my  homestudy . I was  supposed  to have read it a long time ago but what with one technicality and another I just got to see it yesterday. It's pretty interesting in that there, in  "hard copy"  is  you , your beliefs, your life, your relationships and your aspirations; in fifteen pages or less  single spaced ; written by someone who has met you  five  times. All-in-all, it's pretty accurate (although obviously  skewed  slightly to address specific issues that might matter to the  agency types .) There was one funny thread about my mom though. I guess in the interviews I kept saying she was " loud " (which she  is  but more a  boisterous , completely lacking in  tact  or  sublety  kind of loud). Apparently, though, what the  caseworker  was hearing was that she  "yells alot."  "Cynthia's mother often yelled at her...." Now, I'm not saying  mom   never  yelled but she didn't yell all  that  much, she was just  LOUD  about everything. Whatever. If I want, i can go in and have them change the report but since the  odds  of my  mom  ever seeing this are slim and since I'm  deathly afraid  of messing with anything at this stage in the matching process, I think i'm going to let it be. Sorry mom.
