          She wasn't good...  but she had good intentions!  Lyle =Great. Great performer, great singer, great songwriter. Although, I may not go to his shows anymore (KIDDING!) onna counta the  company  I'm being forced to keep whilst in attendance is beginning to get to me. Seriously people, am I the only freaking  non-white ,  non-upper middle class ,  non-early-to-late forties  chick (who wasn't brought by her parents)  in the world  who loves me some  Lyle ? And the overall  vibe ; the whole "Let's call him by his first name (e.g. {shouted out mid-performance} "We love you,  Lyle !") Let's act like we  really  know the man, let's pretend we [all  three hundred  of us] are his close, personal friends and should be allowed to suggest what he plays next!"  vibe  kills me! Sheesh. I kept wanting to just cringe away whenever anyone started with the  calling out . I want a  pin  that says "loving Lyle in a  healthy  way..." {sigh} ah well. c'est la vie.   I  do  gotta say that there were considerably more  peeps of color  at this particular show than were at the last one. I was a teensy bit worried because  Mr. Lovett  did not choose to bring his  back-up singers  to this gig meaning that  the ranks  were  potentially diminished  five-fold... Luckily, he enlisted the aid of a local  gospel choir  who were apparently each allowed to bring  two  guests -- I'm just assuming, since I ended up counting  thirteen  brown people in the audience divided by the five brown types in the choir... Sorry. Just tired of standing out all the freaking time.... Still and all, show was great. Got home at midnight. Am currently exhausted.     A friend of mine is traveling around  New Zealand  and he wrote this in an e-mail:   "thinking of taking a train across the outback to  Perth ..."    Gawd! is that a beautiful concept or what??! I have  got  to get out of here and go do some serious traveling. I mean like NOW...  {sigh, again} still tired. must go work now....
