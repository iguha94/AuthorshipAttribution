          And now it's Monday...  Well, here we are again. At work. {yawn} I had a wierd dream last night. I'm not going to go into it in detail onna counta it was a fairly  obvious ploy  on the part of my  subconscious  to get me to start paying attention to some  key  life lessons and since I've made it my job to  avoid that kind of stuff  I'll not dwell on the bulk of it.   One interesting bit though, featured the arrival of my  future boyfriend ,  Mark  (a sweetheart. cute in a scruffily quiet kind of way. looked kind of like my kid's teacher  Chrissy-bear ,  who , get this, has been known to  skate  with  Dirty Boy ! Small world, eh?? Christ, I'm old...). The aforementioned bit also contained footage of my slightly  more future   girlfriend,  Milo  (sorry,  Mark ). O.K. now even if this was  all  I chose to pay attention to, what the hell?? I find it so bizarrely interesting that while my own subconcious  will  admit attraction to and subsequent hooking up with a boy,  even it  won't pretend I could sustain a lasting relationship with one. Although, in the dream, I got together with  Mark  first and was only introduced to  Milo  right before the alarm woke me up so,  technically , she wasn't my girlfriend  yet  but I think we could all see where things were heading!   Again though, I could be reading this  totally wrong  and I may instead be destined for a  non-monogamous-three-way  with both (Whoo Hoo!!) or just doomed to be with the one yet pining after the other for years on end (dammit!)... either way though, it's all  too scary  for me to think more about right this second. I will chalk it up random fantasies dreamed up by a generically horney imagination and let it go.  In other news, I'm  still  going to  Lyle Lovett  tonight! Whoo Hoo! Now  there's  a man I could commit too!!
