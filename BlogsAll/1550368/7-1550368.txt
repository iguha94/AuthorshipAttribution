          Standing up to be counted...  Er... ah... I mean  sitting down ! So, I've been selected to participate in a  nationwide survey  regarding adults and reading. I received a brochure in the mail (which I promptly tossed into my  oft cleaned ,  never smelly  kitchen gar-bage receptacle) then Friday eve  this guy  comes around with a  sheaf  of papers asking if I am, in fact, the person living in ... blah, blah, blah and if i could answer a few questions. Suffice to say, I , like most of my  fellow Americans  probably would not  have even opened  the door had I known who this person was and what he represented but, since I did, I felt it behooved me to invite him the hell in. Long story short, The ole  US  of  A  is trying to get a feel for "adult reading patterns" and I ( I ) get to represent my block! Whoo Hoo!  Jane Eyre , in the house, yo! Anyway, this, as with most things, started with " a few questions " yet quickly became " I'll come over Monday evening for  2 hours  and ask you every imaginable question I can dream up about the ways in which you fancy yourself literate ." {sigh} I mean, I suppose it's for  the good of the country  or something but what about  Seinfeld ? ... Speaking of which, I went ahead and assumed from the  sheaf  and the standard issue laptop that ole  Jim Ferguson  [6'2'', Caucasian male, early 50's, clean-shaven with greying hair] was  not  a serial killer but, in the event that I  fail to post tomorrow , go to my house and  check the crawlspace . Oh,  and feed the cats . If, by chance, I'm not in the crawlspace and am instead someplace more easily accesible ( like under the bed ) I don't want them lunching on my remains.
