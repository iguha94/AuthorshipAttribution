          the response   So, the  ad  was placed on  Friday  and i  must  say the response was better than I anticipated. Out of about  67 replies  there were  10  which were  not  insipid and  1  which  was  insipid but it was soooo insipid that I  had  to reply and the ensuing dialog has actually been quite hilarious. The  ad  ran in both the  Girl seeks Boy  and the  Girl seeks Girl  category (not to worry. I was a  good  bi-girl and warned everyone that that would be happening...) The  breakdown  in response, by  gender , was  64 boys  and  3 girls . One of the girls was looking for someone " feminine  and  discrete " both of which I am  in spades  but I just didn't think it would work; another wondered if I would like to meet her husband accompanied by a pic of her (i'm assuming, husband's) member ( sexy !)plus they live in  San Jose , and the last was from a  charming lady  who seemed intelligent and normal and who I must therefore  be afraid  of. Not that I'm  not  going to write back but I don't know if I have it in me to associate with a gal I can't  keep at arm's length . P'raps I should give ole  San Jose  and her body part a chance...
