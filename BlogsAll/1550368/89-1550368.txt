          what does desperation smell like?  K. so I cannot stop going to    travel sites   and checking on " vacation sales ." I came  THIS  close to booking a flight to   Georgia   because it was cheaper than  Albuquerque  (where I actually  have  family)... I was in the elevator this morning and some chick was talking about  Washington DC  and I started thinking "Hmmmmm.  DC ... What is there to do in  DC ? We could go to the  Mint !" The  Mint . I ask you...! {sigh} I am soooo needing to just freaking GO somewhere! But where? And with what? Contrary to all appearances I'm not exactly rolling in the cash right now... Anyways, if anyone knows someplace good and cheap (or expensive to get to but with appropriate "ins" -- re: someone me and the  Boo  could stay with for a coupla days) let me know ASAP otherwise I'm afraid I'm just going to book the next  non-refundable fare  I see and wind up in  Salt Lake City  standing in line to see the Osmond's birthplace!! (Not, that there's anything wrong with that....)    So, you know what's fun? Sit down with a  six year old  (it's more fun if it's  your   six year old  but if you are not so  blessed  feel free to borrow one from the  neighbors ) and flip through a fashion   magazine . Flip through fairly fast, page by page and let the kid tell you what/who  appeals to them  and what doesn't. Every so often see if you can get them to tell you what it is exactly that they don't like about the " nahs ". I  guarantee  you will gain an  incredible amount of insight  into the  human psyche . Plus, it's  fun . I, myself learned that "furry bags are  weird ", that there is such a thing as "too much gold", and that  even a six year old  can tell when a lady is "way too skinny!"
