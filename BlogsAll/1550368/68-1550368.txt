          my butt hurts!  I have a  HUGE  bruise on my  tuchas  from last night when I rather unceremoniously fell onto a  pile of wood/tools  in a feeble effort to make my kid's room  slightly safer  for her to occupy until the loft is completely finished. HUGE. all purple and green with a sexy red welt running down the center of it...! Yup, who wants some NOW, Baby!    In other news:   Here's  a seemingly cool organization that  Sleeping Beauty  left in the comments section. I read through the site and it seems like they're trying to do some good in the world. Plus the site itself is pretty spiffy. Go check it out if you get a chance and/or if you are or know a teen-aged girl in  Alameda  county.    Did I mention my ass??  Hurts ! Still! I sailed in here slightly late this morning and got  right to work  on one of my projects only to notice that I had an  e-mail  saying that I was required to be in some meeting with all the  big bosses  that had  already started  and that I ended up wandering into an HOUR late... Nice. Seriously, is there anyone out there wondering why the hell I haven't been politely asked to leave yet??
