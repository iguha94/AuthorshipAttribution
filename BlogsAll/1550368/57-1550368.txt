          Can't we all just geek along??    This  is cool. ["Pond" is especially beautiful.]    Got a "date" with  Pretty Boy  this week-end. We're going to go eat. I dunno what it is about me and him and the eating; I'm not a big "eater"... I mean it's just not the first (or even  second  or  third ) thing on my "list of things to do" but it's always what we end up doing. Actually, I  do  know very well why I need to have a table between us  at all times  but still... if anyone can think of any other  socially acceptable  ways for me to keep my mouth busy, let me know....   In other news, the new    Chez Lovah Lovah   is in a swanky-dank,  rha-thah upscale  part of town which I usually avoid like the plague and which brings with it a certain  dilema ... On the one hand it becomes obvious to me that the  Boo  will no longer be allowed to visit  Mr. L-L   EVER AGAIN  (sorry, dude.) but on the other... how's she ever going to learn what  not to be like  if I keep sheltering her from the "thems" that populate his new world?? {sigh} Well, noone ever said  motherhood  would be easy...    Speaking of me and  Boo  and a dog named Sue -- we are off, off, off the next coupla days registering for school, getting hair made longer and pinker, meeting potential little sises -- so, while I  will  have the  ole laptop   physically  WITH me I may not be  posting  with any regularity {sounds of beating breasts, gnashing of teeth and desolate weeping in the streets} I might though. Depends on how good a time I'm having and how much I want to gloat about it!
