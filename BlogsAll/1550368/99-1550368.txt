          It's all relative...  So some  lady  sitting in front of me on the bus today,  sneezed  and when I said "God, bless you!" She gave me  this  HUGE  smile . I was puzzling over this as the bus continued along on it's merry way until I saw she was holding a  yellow rosary  and apparently reciting her " Hail Mary's ". I guess it means more to have a stranger  save your soul  from the ernstwhile   clutches of evil spirits /eternal damnation if you're Catholic....     Gosh, I am soooo freaking busy right now! K. Sorry for the scarcity of witticisms. I've been forced into a position here that is uncomfortably close to  actual work  and I'm just not sure i'm o.k. with it! Birthday din-din last night was grand!  Kid  was a bit tired and as such was the tiniest bit cranky but in gen. all = good. The  Mondo B-day extravaganza  is slated for tomorrow and can I  JUST  say, I can hardly wait!!!! Sheesh, you'd think it was for  me   or something (Hee Hee, it soooo is! I'm just glad the  Kid  is o.k. with me vicariously  re-imaging my childhood  experience through her. I'm scared what'll happen when she's twelve and won't let me share her life anymore!! hmmmmmm. p'raps  bribery  is in order.... Or some sort of  blackmail . We shall see....) Anyways, really just stopped by to give the old heads up to my loyal fans re: my  lack of communication : It's not  you , I promise! It's   me  . I just can't  commit ...! Eh, hem... anyway....
