          "Hurry up and wait" still...   Just got off phone with the  Caseworker . He is a study in being encouraging while at the same time completely non-commital.   Highlights from this particular conversation:  "Good news! We're having a training that you should probably come to since we'll probably be seeing something come up for you fairly soon."  "I should probably schedule another visit to the house just in case we get a bite this time. Hmmmmm. How about early next month?"  "You're at the top of the list at this agency but then again, since you're looking for a younger child you'll probably be up against several other families on thier side."  AAAARRRRGGGGGGG! There are 70,000 waiting children in the California Foster Care System. I just want  one . Sigh. Oh well, good things come to those who've abandoned all hope. We shall persevere.  In other news, i just found out my  Big Brother  is planning to participate in a triathalon in Hawaii. My first question is, of course, why even go to Hawaii if you're just going to torture yourself once you get there.   Jason  is also trying to get to Hawaii. Go visit his   donations page  and give him lots of money. (Technically it's going to the AIDS Project LA , so even if you don't feel like doing something just because I say so and/or you don't know him from Mathilda's second cousin,  donate  anyway, it's a good   cause !)
