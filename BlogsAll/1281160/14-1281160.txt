Hi friends, i am also eager to join you people, but that as i told, i am a bit occupied and thats restraining me from adding my views to the blog.  But then i can see that from Jax and Kicha's views there are few factors affecting the mindset of the people.  1. Not enough of awareness on the options available regarding IT related jobs is the first factor.  2. Inablilty of the teacher's to bring those options on to the students. In many cases its becoming now obvious that students excel teachers and they teach their own teachers.  3. Apart from this, i think, as an individual, the student himself doesnt know which field is suitable for him. Human nature is so complex and is a mixture of various aspects that it makes difficult for everyone to understand what is one's own strength and what one must pursue. Very few of them know feebly what will suit them and what they want to pursue in their career(including me). And very rarely few of them know exactly what is it they need and strongly pursue them. And most of them i hope u all know what i am going to say....... Yes i repeat, dont know what is one's own strength and what one must pursue! Its by trial and error and after many attempts one discovers what is needed and what is the exact match amongst many options available.   More views on this in my later blogs!   Ok friends lets welcome Ganesh, Rajesh and Kavitha to our group!   Wish them happy blogging.  bye for now   from  Ranjini
