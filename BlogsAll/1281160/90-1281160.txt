Hi,      I was not feeling well last week......fever & head ache......the usual head ache, but it was more severe this time......My doctor said i was anaemic, & has prescribed iron tablets........Ganesh worries too much abt this, & stuffs me with fruits, veggie salads & lot more....he wants my haemoglobin to increase in a single day......he refuses to understand that it's a periodic process.....now i'm ok, other than the anaemic part......     So actually we missed the I-day celebs.......it was scheduled on saturday & hosted by the Indian students association of UK......we just called our friends here & wished them.....On friday, i watched & recorded the pattimandram alone, so that Ganesh can see it later.........      I have got an "A" grade in my exams.....       Yeah Mahen, i know you are very much interested in networking...but i did'nt know that you are preparing for the CCNA exam.....great!!! All the best...i'll surely help you with the best of my knowledge.....But i doubt my future interests in networking.....Networking is a great field.....But i won't be suitable for the field, i guess....i cannot  crawl under the office floors to look out for outlet boxes & cables, nor can i climb up a ladder rack to reach out to the top most switch or hub for connections......I'm not that confident about my physique.....But i'm sure CCNA ceritified network engineers have great value......They can march amidst the entire lot with heads high!!! CCNA pannavae naan indha paadu paduraen......idhula, Ganesh wants me to complete CCNP & CCIE also in the future......        Rini, looking ahead for ur mom's arrival???.....kuduthu vaechava di!!!!
