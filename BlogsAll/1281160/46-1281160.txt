hi friends,  ya as my senior is absent today, i am just keeping the blog updated! Welcome Vijay and ya jax, i always wanted to tell u to put Archives in list box in reverse chronology and this is well taken care. So its good. And ya cant we have an Edit link in the page so that only the members can go directly go to the Edit page directly rather than going to blogger and then getting into that page? And jax, how about putting the name of the writer first on top of the page rather than at the bottom. Coz if there is a blog as big as mine , u will have to scroll to bottom to see who has written it. So better put the writers name on top. Do it if u feel ok.  Yes Valli sindhu, namba bloggeraye battle field aakkittenga pola irukku and only now the tycoon and hurricanes have subsided i believe. This atmosphere is good! Kavi will be back soon to our group when posted.   And ya Sindhu and valli i will mail u people my snaps to ur personal ids.  What happened to Rajesh Ganesh? No blogs!  Jax i couldnt read ur story as i wasnt able to open the file. Dont know whats the probs and once done will let u know about it.   Hei ladies how both are u doing well in cooking? And valli how do u spend ur time? Mail us what is ur daily routine and some interesting things too.....  Ok then bye for now from  Ranjini
