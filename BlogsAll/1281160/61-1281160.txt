hey Xavier,  It was interesting to read all ur predictions man.....u were going on the right lane, but suddenly drifted, & started predicting wrong......   You use a Win Xp with IE6  : right  used AOL to view the blog  : right, i always use AOL to hook up to the net  You accessed the blog somewhere around a university  : Based on which date was this prediction made?....Library is near the Univ, But i went there a couple *                                                                                        of  weeks back I'm going to do A.S in University of Ketucky.....& i guess CalTech is California Institute of Technology....California is nearly 2400 miles from my place..... we don't have any  street named San Pasqual Street, Pasadena. Cross checked this with our Lexington maps too....Ofcourse, i've a printer near me & i'm facing the printer....  appuram indha  Vending machine ellam buruda dhaana???.....how can u predict a vending machine man?....yaara aemaatha paakkura?....  I'm not sure if they offer a course in "Information Design or Architecture"? in CalTech....But there's a department called IMD(Infomation Management & Design) in UK(Univ of Kentucky) & a web designing course in Sullivan Univ(private), Lexington......  It was a good start man.....continue to practice this art....  Happy week end Guys..... shld pack up things for our journey...starting off early  this afternoon.....bye...
