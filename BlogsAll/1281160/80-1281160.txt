A new discussion was sprouting up!!....i thought it wud grow big....but mulaillayae killiteenga!!!.....Anyway, nice never ending topic, that was....  we get thunder storms every now 'n then....Winter it is ice storm or snow storm, spring it is floods or thunder storms, summer it is tornados.....these extreme temps are really making me nuts....  Kishore, thriyaama sollittaen...mannichidu.......Infy pathi yaaru muuchu vittalum ivaru mela kaathu adikkumaam....dhoda!!!.....indha vetti bandhakku onnum koraichal illa.......kadavulae, indha kishore innum 10 yrs kku idhae project la irukkanum......  Yes Xavier, i thought of reminding u, abt the bios.....names on the LHS & bios on the RHS...does not seem to be appealing.....Anyway, waiting for the completed colorful layout.... indha lay out aavadhu konjam naal uyiroda irukkaattum......i'll check with those gals....don't know why they have'nt responded yet....& Xavier, i really wonder, how u have time to present so much everyday.....browsed ur other blog....turning out really good...continue to practise....  I'm supposed to opt for a foreign language as part of my graduation....i searched the list for tamil......but i cud'nt find it out.....kodhithu ezhulndaen.....en thai mozhi, indha mannil, oru anniya mozhiyaaga en arivikka padavillai????.....shld complain abt this to Rajesh's edhiri katchi (who's struggling hard to make tamil as the first lang for the entire schooling for the future generations).....what do u guys think abt that?.... this step is to isolate Tamil Nadu from the rest of the world...even rest of India.....to disable our future generation, making them handicapped...unfit to compete with the rest of the world...I  hope this never happens.....the future of tamilnadu is not in the hands of youth.....it's now in a very old, skin shrunk, trembling, unsteady pair of hands.....  happy weekend.... bye...
