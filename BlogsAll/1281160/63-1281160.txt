Hi all,  Got time to blog.  Following is the description of our enjoyment in Manny sister's marriage. Rajesh.Vijay & myself started off to Trichy on Tuesday evening from Koyambedu. all of us started to eat the chips & biscuits which vijay had bought.  as usual after Chengalpattu Rajesh started meddling with his cell phone. both vijay & rajesh did not allow me to sleep at all.  reached trichy at 1 at night. found the lodge which manny had booked and found ajyan,bala,sam,sandil,vinoth kumar & manny already boozing.since it was late they had already started the party. i got only 2 rounds of our favourite "Old Cask".  Vignesh came at 4 in the morning.went to sleep a short while later.ram & murtu came in the morning while we were still sleeping.  got ourselves ready & went for the marriage at 8.30.had a nice breakfast. immediately after the marriage ate our lunch & went to the room to continue our sleep. ajayan,vijay,ram  & bala went to Srirangam.   woke up in the evening & went to Mapillai's house at BHEL to have the feast which it seems is a custom.   since the mission of having free food was completed (hihihihi) each one of us started to our respective places.manny,vijay ,sam & myself started off to chennai.  that's how it went.  then saw "Nalla  Thamayanthi" on Thursday. Witty movie with lots of humour. But the best part comes in the last 5 minutes of the movie when my "Thalaivar Kamal" comes with the "Sandiyar" costume.  Unknowingly I started shouting "Thalaiva". Just could not wait to see the movie.  hope it was not boring  bye
