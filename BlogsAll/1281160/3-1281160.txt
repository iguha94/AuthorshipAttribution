Hi,    On World Cup...     So... Its all over... But not really... things r just beginning to build up... There r quite a few positive things that the Indian team can take forward after the world cup...   1. We were 202/5 after 34 overs. Scoring 200+ in 34 ov is not an easy task against an Aussie bowling attack. This goes to show our batting strength. But, the only trouble was all the bowlers had an off-day on the same day.  2. Dravid did decent job behind wickets all this time. From now on, they can look forward to grooming Parthiv Patel. He's an ecxcellent keeper and a fair batsman and above all he's only 16 !!!  3. Bangar was used as a frontline bowler when we went to WI and as a lower order one-day batsman when they came here. Right prospects to get a genuine all-rounder in the side which will effectively make India go with 5 bowlers.  4. With Parthiv in, as a specialist keeper, India might shuffle between Bangar, Agarkar and Dinesh Mongia depending on form and fitness of players. Srinath and Kumble are ageing and r already almost over-the-hill.  5. With Sehwag showing some weakness with the moving ball I feel they might well be back to Sachin-Sourav opening combination and Sehwag might come in the middle/late order to take care of slog overs.   6. Yuvraj and Kaif might also be retained for test matches. As these two have got excellent temperament and so could be quite a handful in the tests as they gain some experience.  So, after all, nothing is lost.
