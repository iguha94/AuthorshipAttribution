Hi Jax,             I can always send it the second time Jax....It was just a small disappointment yesterday....that's it.....Maybe, i'll also use notepad in the future...            Welcome Mahendran!!!......expecting lot more interesting news from u.....Adhukaaha, hindi la ellam type pannina....India vandhu udhaippaen....either convey it in the Universal Lang or our mother tounge man.....convey my wishes to ur sis....  this's what i was  trying to post yesterday.....  I've planned to go to school from this summer.....I'm going to do an Associate degree in Computer Information Systems....this's a 2 yrs course....classes r starting from next wednesday..... I can take only 7 credits in summer....but still, it helps me finish off the course as soon as possible....Initially we had opted for M.S....But, know what.....even the deadline for 2004 spring is over....so i can do M.S only in 2004 fall.....but there's more than an yr's gap inbetween....i cud finish off A.S by then & get into the work stream.....  So guys, if somebody's planning to do M.S here.....think far ahead, so that u don't waste ur years & age.....  Hey sindhu, this "Toll system" is existing here for nearly a decade or so.....in almost all the metros......I doubt if that's going to be a reason to reduce the percentage of traffic......here they do that for revenue......For all of us, there's the federal tax & the state tax.....But for people in metros the Govt collects a city tax also...this toll system is a way of collecting city tax from both the stagnent & the floating population....But ofcourse, US is really weak in public transport systems....so maybe in UK it may act as a traffic reducing agent......  I guess, this system already exists in India......For ex, I"m not sure....but just recollect.....on your way to Pazhamudircholai from Azhagar kovil, they stop us & collect money & give back a reciept...remember???....that's ofcourse a toll system....maybe  a manual toll system, unlike here....This's just an example.... Actually,  i shld have quoted a freeway or a state highway...but since i did'nt know anything in particular, i'm saying this...   hey Rini,.....great that u were able to get three weeks off from ur work......  this weekend we are going to Chicago for an Engagement....The bridegroom is my cousin & the bride is Ganesh's Cousin......looking forward to have a great time, after a very long time....It takes nearly 8 hrs to reach Chicago from our place......This's totally a family get together...so we'll not have much time to tour around Chicago this time....but i'm waiting impatiently, just to see one place...the Indian bazaar there.....One full road, with boards & signs written in hindi, tamil, telugu...It's typically our Renganathan st, it seems....inclusive of kai aendhi bhavans .........poor Ganesh is trembling to take me there....'coz i've been making a list for the past one week...&  i wonder, the list never seems to end....i still get things in my mind,  to purchase every now & then....  Xavier....trying to become a cyber detective?....nice to read all ur guesses...but why is that, everytime, u end up in either guessing Kicha's machine or Sindhu's?.....if u continue to do this....i'll have to conclude that it's an agreement b/w u & those two...try to guess something else man....    bye
