Hi guys, here is my weekend tale!   Yes this saturday, i dint do anything special except for getting tired of seeing Lord of Rings Twin tower. I felt sleepy at the end of first CD itself. So dint watch the rest of the movie. Morning i met kicha and had a nice time with him walking along 80 ft. road and enjoying, the morning sun and trees fully loaded with  summer flowers with gossips about the happenings of kicha's and my life! Then he waved off and i trodded to srini's place. Ya i forgot to tell u guys, i did add two more members to my pretty fresh and frolic flowers family. One more rose this time. No not yellow, not red. Its a different pink. Then one more omam plant which is a medicinal herb. Wish them to grow well.    Hei that yellow bud of which i was talking, it has grown, but not so beautifully. I wish it was beautiful, like the first offset. But nay it dint grow as good as that. No probs, it is yet to give me so many beautiful blossoms! So i will wait for those moments.    Then i got back to hostel in the evening and washed a load of clothes and retired to bed early.   Next day as usual we went early in the morning to take a fresh view of Lord Krishna and Radhe at ISKCON. Wow so fresh in pink, just the same color of the rose which i had bought yesterday! Then came back home and did prayer and then i went to my cousin brother's place. Srini went to his friend's place and promised to join me in the evening at my brother's place. We had a great time chatting and bulling each other!  So did my weekend go.   And yes guys, i am now been offered more responsibility than before and we are to accomplish our targets. So i wont be updating blogs as frequently as i do now with big tales.   Bye for now  from  Ranjini
