Hi friends, More of musical wave on our blog. Nice to listen.  Hei ram, i tried to download that hotbar, but i couldnot coz i dont have rights. So couldnot enjoy using it.  And ya i dint tell u people right, i got a call from Sinoop yesterday after a long time. He wanted to hear my voice and to check if i am still at bangalore. So he called me up it seems. How funny. Then to my surprise, i caught rajesh online. I was logged on to msgr from my friend's system and so could not chat. So asked him to send mails and had a nice time with him for a while with relay of emails. Then in the evening, Rajesh and Ganesh called me up and we had a nice conference over phone and it was nice sharing some fun with them. Those two fellows, keeping me online, started fighting over phone about who is the hard worker. It was nice to learn that Ganesh is working hard starting from the near by park in the morning and ending at Valluvar kottam in the afternoon and then in the evenings at each tea stall, coz his uncle would shout at him if he comes back soon before 9 o clock. And rajesh toh, is rated at the best hardworker with his scedule from morning to evening at his bed in his room. So will all the fun, the conversation ended and so do my mail.  Ok then guys, now off for the weekend. Cares and shares  Ranjini
