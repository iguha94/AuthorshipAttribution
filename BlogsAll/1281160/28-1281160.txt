Hi,       Yesterday was an interesting day. It went on as interestingly as it started. Infy's results were announced. Even though it had achieved company projections... the market analysts expectation was not reached.  Furthermore, the forecast for next year that infy gave was 12-14% while the market expected it to be around 20-25%... and the resultant...  market shattered... infy lost more than 1000 bucks in a single day, ie., over 25% lost... and ended at Rs. 3049    for ramgopal's query, Hughes s/w lost over 11% and ended at Rs.179  Not just that... almost every tech company lost more then 10-15% and Mastek led the way by losing 49% and ended at Rs.285      yesterday that was the talk of everyone... now I really understand the worth of our MS(IT&M) course. Even though all around me were discussing shares and businesses I was atleast able to figure out what all the fuss was about and could chip in with some sensible inputs to them.  I usually keep a slender track of the markets ever since the day I started reading BusinessWorld (to be more precise, from March 2002). Now my interest is only increasing...     and am going home today. heard that vijay babu is coming to mdu to collect his cert. Hope to meet him. and jax, will call u saturday night or sunday morning... and be back here on monday morning...    Kicha
