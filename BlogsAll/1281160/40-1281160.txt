Hi all,  Was a hectic weekend with lots of travelling.  started from chennai on saturday night for triunelveli.did not get a bus to direct tirunelveli so had to take bus to madurai.then in madurai got a bus to tirunelveli.it went to periyar i was very curious to see the place after a very long time.  landed in tirunelveli after almost 14 hours of travel at around 12'o clock.vinod came to pick me up.ajayan & bala were already there  .  rajesh came in the evening & we all started for kovilpatti to attend vijay babu's brother wedding.after a very good dinner went to the lodge which he had booked. then as usual "whisky" took the center stage.  talked about a lot of things before we went to sleep at around 2'o clock. attended the marriage in the morning.shoba had also come from triunelveli to attend the marriage.rajesh started off to sivakasi to atend his relative's marriage and vinod,ajayan,bala & myself started off to madurai to get the convocation certificate.  met rajadurai,om prakash,chitra mam,kannan sir & some juniors & other friends also.then at 9 i started off to chennai.others were planning to go to movie.i sat inthe bus at 9 but it finally started from maduari at 12'0 clock only.  i think i was the first passenger to be booked.then when the bus was full,the concerned person came & thanked me that bcoz i booked first the bus was full now.i did not know whether to laugh or shout at him.  finally reached chennai at 9 a.m. did not go to office for reporting.and now iam in the browsing center typing u this blog.  bye
