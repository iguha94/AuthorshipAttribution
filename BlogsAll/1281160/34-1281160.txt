Hey ram, thanx for complimenting me for having blogged more.   And here is my weekend tale. This time sunday was verrrrrrrrry interesting. Usually we used to go to ISKCON only around 11 o clock and come back in scorching sun. But this time, Srini asked me, "Hei r u ready to come and see the first aarthi?" I said y not, with a faint idea of knowing that it was at morning 7.15. Then having decided, we planned to move accordingly. My god i was amazed at the krishna was! He was in pure red. If there had been anything which seems so pure to me in red color, it was his dress that day. We reached early morning 7.20 though we missed the first few moments all those moments which followed were so good.Early morning i was stunned by the beauty of krishna to the extent that one second, i thought the day is also stunned seeing krishna and so eveything is immobile for a second. But all those musical dance and merriful prayers on the lrod brought me back to conscious.   One more thing happened so surprisingly. Daily i used to tell suprabhatam at hostel, but i wont be able to tell on sats and sundays. I always tried and due to my sluggish nature, and lazines of my body, i just used to sleep. But on sunday i properly pray together with srini. But anyway i used to miss my suprabhatam. But it so happened that infront of Srinivasa Govinda, they said Suprabhatham. I was totally carried away. Ah, those single bell sound after every four lines, and all of us chanting at same pace, nonstop in continuous breath, without anykind of background music, only those words which u have been telling for many days really rises something in u.   Apart from this my weekend was good as usual with srini. Today is my brother's birthday and i rang up to him to wish him. I got him a camera and he liked it a lot it seems!  Jax i havent yet started reading ur story, will pass on my comments once its done. Ok guys lots more when time permits  Till then Cares and shares Ranjini
