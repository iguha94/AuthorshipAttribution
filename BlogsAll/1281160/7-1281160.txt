Hi everyone,    The war has finally started in Iraq.       My thoughts on the war:   It is totally unwarranted  for. I believe that this war is just an excuse for Bush to browbeat the world into acknowledging the US as a world's policeman. Bush says that the people of Iraq have been suffering under Saddam and that Saddam is bad for the people of Iraq.   I  guess if someone (say a leader of any other nation) believes that Bush is bad for US,  that person can initiate a war to topple Bush's regime in US (same logic as US invasion of Iraq).   Bush has also said that Saddam  posseses WMD. Hans Blix differs. UN dithers. But tell what can the world if a couple of US special forces take into Iraq a few WMD devices and proclaim that they had captured it. Surely Bush would not allow anyone to inspect it clainmimg it as  prize of war."Will America forget about nation building in Iraq -- the same way America forgot about nation building in Afghanistan --   as soon as the Iraqi oil wells are secured?"  I can only feel sad that around 70% of the US citizens support "little Bush" in his war to depose the man from Tikriti.     'Today I weep for my country'    While  it's raining bombs in Baghdad, it is pouring at Durban. India's WC seems to be a washout. the Kenyans might have been washed out anyway on the field,  barring a few dodos and pigs flying. With   heavy rains  predicted for the rest of the week in South Africa, I hope that this tournamnet doesn't go the way of the ICC Champions League held a few months back at Colombo.  Hoping for your thoughts on the US invasion of Iraq... Jax.
