Hi,  I can't resist sharing the following piece from the Infy BB... (and for those who wonder what BB is - its Bullettin Board)... this is the lightest side of any sport... Enjoy...      Soccer at its BEST!!!   It concerns a match played some time back between Barbados and Grenada in some cup competition. Barbados needed to win the game by two clear goals in order to progress to the next round.   Now the trouble was caused by a daft rule in the competition which stated that in the event of a game going to penalty kicks, the winner of the shoot-out would be awarded a 2-0 victory. (Yes, I'm sure you can all see what's coming....)   With 5 minutes to go, Barbados were leading 2-1, and going out of the tournament. Then, when they realised they were probably not going to score against Grenada's massed defence, they turned round, and deliberately scored an own goal, to level the scores. Grenada, themselves not being stupid, realised what was going on, and then attempted to score an own goal themselves. However, the Barbados players started defending their opponents goal to prevent this.  In the last five minutes, therefore, spectators were treated to the incredible sight of a team defending their opponents goal against attackers desperately trying to score an own goal! Naturally, the game went to penalties, which Barbados won... This story is completely true. Apparently it was being televised live, so maybe we'll see highlights of it soon!      Now how's that for sportsmanship....
