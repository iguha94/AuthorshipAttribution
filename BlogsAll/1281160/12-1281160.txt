hi friends     atlast all my problems regarding this blogger came to an end now and im inside this blogger now.thanks to all who helped me in this matter.Here in chennai My life is going on well till now in reliance by having a free mobile connection.But im planning to resign my job this month.Can u guess two things that make me feel bad in leaving this job? It is                         1.Brand of the company and the job                        2.Salary if u are going to think as above then you are a chicken like ranjini and sangee.The real two things that make me cry in leaving this job are                          1.Free mobile connection given to me from reliance                         2.The receptionist of reliance (Ranjitha) Even im going to lose these after my resignation im quitting this job whole heartedly.So i expect all of u to console me for this and pray so that i get a job where i can get a mobile and a gud receptionist.  nice in joining this blogger raapi
