Hi all, glad getting back to u all this time. I just want to say one thing and wind off...  Once prof. Ravichandran in our Marketing class, while trying to clarify a doubt, started out with a real life example...and before giving that example...he uttered these words to the class...it went like... "Though i feel comfortable with my english, i always prefer to speak in tamil as it gives me the feeling of completeness and i would be able to bring in my expressions and thoughts in a more lively manner..."  and he continued his lecture in tamil...  thats what I too feel...that is, language is something that has become a part of urself... for me when it comes to the matter of language... Always THAMIZH stands first... irrespective of the other reasons such as competitiveness and Global convergence...for which we ought to be prepared...Thamizh is my mother tongue thru which i started perceiving things in this world...  And yes...of course...English and other languages are always going to be there...which we cannot ignore...and get along with this world.  In short  Vaalga Thamizh...Valarga Em Makkal...  And regarding Ms.J's so called bold initiatives...  I do agree that strikes shud not be encouraged... but I wont accept the mass dismissal of 1 lac + employees in a messy manner and i wont accept the midnight arrests and harasments done to the Trade union office bearers as well...  Our chief minister says that when the 98 percent of the population is facing the financial problem, the 2 percent govt employees also shud bear with the cost cutting measures...  I cant find any rationale in this argument... i dont know how she was going to devote the money saved from cutting off the privileges of the employyees, for the upliftment of the 98 pecent of the state's population.  Ok...these things are beyond my scope and concern and out of my control for that matter. my wishes are not going to have any impacts over the happenings...so let me be a passive listener wrt this discussion. bye bye tamils...!!!
