Nothing special this weekend... I thought of getting pretty early on saturday and went to bed by 12.30 friday night,  Well, I got up by 8.00 am in the morning..   "Dont jump to conclusion.. that I got up very soon.... coz.. after watching the time piece.. I thought let me have some time more,  so, the next dream came up ....(Xtremely sorry.. I cant reveal my dream dreams....)  My uncle was about to leave office, so he woke me up by 9.30 am.. I asked him to lock the door.. and through the key inside thru window..  Hope he did the same.. Hence continued my sleep... Its now.. 12.00 noon.... Wow.. I thought I have slept for 12 hrs .. Its more than enough...  As I was about to get up.. I thought what I am going to do now laying, in the bed.. But I dont know.. How come I slept. When I atlast woke up by 1.45 pm...  Very early for the next day..;....(ha ha ah aha ha)...  Atlast,, now myself got bored in my sleeping habit.. so I got up irrespective of the pipeline dream...and took my dresses for washing... finished them.. at times lend my ears to music.. and mouth to snacks...atlast I am fresh by 6.00 pm..   Went to temple nearby.. and came home to read newspapers...(pending over a week)   Sunday:-   Planned to got early.. dont take pretty early conclusion.. really I got early... by 6.40 am ... after sleeping by 1.00 pm day b4...  read newspaper, made tea and had them.. dressed up to office... even b4 normal time... I am in the office by 9.40 itself...(nearly 25% days I will be in the office at this time)  Came, gone thru the mails, had a chat with rajesh...   Went to play table tennis.. superb match played for about 1 hours...  then since I forgot my breakfast (intentionally, XcuseMe Rini) I felt very hungry.... so left to home, prepared food... and finished lunch by 3.30 pm... Next put the music... and the bed... slept till 5.00 pm (only one cycle)  Then I got up since I have to go for Praedhosham.. Went & had nice dharshan.. in nearby Murugan temple.. Back to pavilion.... (System...) played hearts.. and heared music..  Then by 9.00 my uncle said he is going to chicago thru phone....(dont astonish.. its an 6 oscar film)   I have to plan out for my dinner.. Went to punjabi daba.. and had a nice meals for dinner...  Thatz all...  The dinner is pretty heavy that I got up only by 8.45 am today.... back to office by 11.00 am...  Ram
