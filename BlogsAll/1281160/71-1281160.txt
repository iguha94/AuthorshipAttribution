hi,       So the discussion is stil llive??!!! it's getting a new dimension....Anyway, answering to Ram's "r u really happy with only that package"......i don't think, i can give an one line answer for this question....this can be a whole lot of another discussion, as Xavier had mentioned......what all do u need to lead a happy life?...Let me recollect Maslow's hierarchy theory......physiological, safety, social, esteem, self-actualisation needs.......Let us omit the last option for now.... we still have a long way to go for that wise & mature need....Let me try to list a set of factors kindling the other four needs.....the prominent factors i can think of are  basic needs(food, shelter, clothing), security, love(need to be needed), belongingness, motivation, self-respect, recognition. Basic needs & security are highly dependent on one's financial soundness...though the other factors are still there, remember that we can proceed to those needs  only if the primary ones are satisfied.....& for the other needs too, money is an indirect factor.......i don't deny that there are things other than money,  one will need in life ....i miss my parents so much.....but that's life.....one fine day,  nee polaippai  thedi poi dhaan aaganum......Twenty or twenty five yrs from now, my kids'll will fly off from my nest......that's nature.....I still have lots & lots of thoughts going round my head abt this....tried hard to make my humble views shorter.....need to go now...  need to mention this.......Bravo to our Chief Minister Dr.J.J!!.....bold decision, firm actions.....accomplished her thoughts.....strikes are in no way to be encouraged, strikes are not solutions for problems.....though it seems to be a bit rude, this's the right tonic...medicines have always been sour & at those times doctors have always been villains, but the underlying truth is, it's for the goodness of our health...  see you guys...... happy weekend.
