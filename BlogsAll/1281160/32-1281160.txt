Hi friends, i like stories esp. greek ones as they are full of fantasy and their names are different and at the same time beautiful. To name few, i came across some names like andromeda, poseidon, perseus, cireas, athene, danae, zeus, cassiophea, phineus and so many. Hei all these are names from a legend called "perseus". We could see that we are using these words like andromeda-name of a constellation and Athene - athens, poseidon - name of a building which i have come across somewhere in bangalore. When i encounter some words which are attractive and beautiful, i found it to be greek most of the times. Inspite of the people even greek names are also beautiful right! Yes they are quite attractive i beleive. Even those legends are quiet interesting to read u know. Do you want to read one where in i encountered all these names? come on walk with me, just a small paragraph ahead will tell u a nice story!  *********************************************************************************************************************************************************************  ACRISIUS, the Argive king, warned by an oracle that his daughter�s son would be the agent of his death, hoped to escape his doom by shutting her up in a brazen tower. But Zeus, the King of Gods, descended into her prison in a shower of gold and Dana� bore to him a son named Perseus. Dana� and her child were exposed in a boat without sail or oar on the sea, but here too fate and the gods intervened and, guided by a divine protection, the boat bore her safely to the Island of Seriphos.  There Dana� was received and honoured by the King.  When perseus had grown to manhood the King, wishing to marry Dana�, decided to send him to his death and to that end ordered him to slay the Gorgon Medusa in the wild, unknown and snowy North and bring  to him her head the sight of which turned men to stone.  Perseus, aided by Athene, the goddess of Wisdom, who gave him the divine sword Herpe, winged shoes to bear him through the air, her shield or aegis and the cap of invisibility, succeeded in his quest after many adventures.  In his returning he came to Syria and found Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopea, King and Queen of Syria, chained to the rocks by the people to be devoured by a sea-monster as an atonement for her mother�s impiety against the sea-god, Poseidon.  Perseus slew the monster and rescued and wedded Andromeda.    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Hope u all enjoyed reading! the story of medusa, we had studied during our high school period. So it would have been a nice refresher i believe for those who had learnt it already.  FYI Nike means "God of victory" in greek and Athene is "Goddess of Wisdom".  Ok guys will see u later  till then  Cares and shares Ranjini
