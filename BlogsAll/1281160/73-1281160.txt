I agree rini’s point of view that language is used as a mean of communication. What we are expressing or learning using the language matters a lot. But most of the people will not see language as a medium, it’s been used as a scale or a determining factor for the living style or Aptitude of the person. That’s what influencing people & makes them use English even when you meet someone from your motherland. This might give the person a sense of security that ‘I am also belong to this group..’.   On the other hand, People are paid off in foreign lands&this is a real case. So people out here have desire to go there& earn at one time or other. So it’s mandatory for them to use English in every day life and it’ not just ‘they want to adopt the foreign custom’. It’s a competitive world & everyone has to prove themselves in all the dimension. They practice it here..that’s it. All this contribute to the mindset of a person like ‘using Tamil in public place is a disgrace’.    However It’s important to make our younger generation to learn tamil properly. But it  shudn’t  stop us from exploring a new language. My personal opinion is..It make no sense spending time in translating all the technical stuff from English into some language whether it is japanese or tamil. We can put all the efforts into some meaningful work which can contribute something to our society. If you remember the Time management chart which  Raja sir told in our class..I put this in ‘Not important & Not urgent’ group.  It’s so nice to see a blog from rajesh after a long time. I haven’t seen the mission statement which ram sent. I will see it. See you all in next blog.Bye..
