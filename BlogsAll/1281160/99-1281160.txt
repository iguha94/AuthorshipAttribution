Layout looks good Jax, more about color combinations in later blogs. But first let me talk to Mahen. Enna settaiya? Rendu perukkum, (Ram&Mahen)appuram naan bisibelebhath senju courier panniruven jaakrathai. What u say is true about it, but the way u prepare varies and taste is also not exactly same ok. Word starum oru text editor, Ms wordum oru text editor, adhukkaga, MS wordum, Word starum onna? they differ in the features right, though they serve the same functionality. Adhe maathiri thaan iduvum. Sari onakku enga puriya poguthu? Idhellam kalyanam aana puriyum. Onakkum thaan, coz now a days guys are fast 2 learning cooking.   I could smell something smoking in Kicha's kitchen too. Now adays he sends me recipe's too. so guys be on his track and start learning. Naan vena some simple recipe's anuppi vakiren.  friends i will be uploading my wedding snaps and vinitha's reception snaps soon onto our groups section by this evening. so watch out for that!  Ok then, on to Rajesh case discussion.... Problem: Rajesh, U know in the world of FMCGs Customer is the king, similarly, here User is the king. He has the right to decide his own way of transport. Since the advent of share auto we could see that the same transport can be arranged at half the earlier price. There is no wonder if a person opts for cheap and best service. But its a subtle problem, coz, these autorickshawalas have to charge more as they can accomodate less people, where as share autos can charge less as they accomodate more people. So these auto walas will have to suffer, if they cut the cost to the extent of these share autos....  Solution: Need to think a bit, so will post it later Bye for now Ranjini
