Hi,  S we had a fantastic weekend (myself and kicha, on saturday), went to nandhi hills, superb place.. and fanstastic memorable hill resort which will cherish anyone... we had a great day over there, morning by 5.30 we got up after discussing a long about solution the day b4 and sleeping past mid night... catch bus by 7.20 to majestic, from there 8.30 to nandhi hills.. reached the base of the hill by 10.30.. had some refereshments over there, reached the top by 11.00... went roaming the entire hill for around 2 hours.. had breeze over the top mountain.. nice sleep for about 40 mts in the orchard...Okay food in a hotel... then by 2.15 took bus to blr... on the way to down...conductor (the point to be noted is LADY) stoped a bus in a shop to have tender coconut for them... Y ????? we should wait and watch them having those.. so we both ordered two for us.... and before I finish it... the driver has finished...and conductor (lady) also atmost finished.... the driver pressed the horn... to remind us to finish soon... but how dare she....Whistled and said "Right,,,, Right" no probs, Kicha has already finished.. and I also atmost... anyway we have paid also.. hence thatz all the scene over there.... Back to home by 5.30.. had chat by 6.30 b4 that a light tea...sent offf kicha...and heared songs.. went to bed...  Sunday... got up early by 8.00 am....dressed up to office. by 11.00 am.... replied the hell no.. of mails (nearly 12 within 2 days...) and official nearly 6 within a day.... had some work for half an hour... and started browsing...  by 1.40 came to know ganguly rarely won the toss..but prefered to field.. he taught as like new zealand, and pakistan... But Ricky's Pounding 9 sixes and unbeaten 144 most of u know... made a tremendous target for Indians to climb ...like Mt. Kanchenjunga...  I watched at times.. had my lunch by 2.30... then came for browsing... then by 5.30 or so.. went to watch our play in the pitch..... since the target is huge.. I almost taught we lose and they deserve... anyway there is bit criples in my heart saying "WE should get the cup etc..like that" but sachins out in 4 and ganguly left the rest the Gang without a strong hold..assured the cup to aussie...  Now shewag was doing fine.. and there was a bit rain.. so  I thought yagas and yaganas are going for our pray.. to nature.. to abadon the match and restart.. but that too favoured aussies.. Who really deserve...But was quiet and calm...  So I left the office by 9.00 after watching a little bit match here and there..to have a nice dinner and sleep...  Thatz over with the weekend...  Anyway just to encourage Rini... I typed these..coz..If some one is responding we should go with them.... have lot of work.. moving out.. since testing had to be completed b4 tommorrow's release...  Bye Cheerfully Ram  coming to kichas "A.C Muthaih..." Its human mind man.. finding way for the destination.... and that too.. Politicians and great heads... Has to say something.... they dont have enough time to think for Journalists questions... I am sure..Muthaih.. might have realised the same after 2 hours of delivering the news...
