Hi,      Congrats Rajesh! & all the best.     It seems as though, only a few days passed by, since Ganesh started holding my hands.....but, one year has has rolled by, in a wink.....Had great celebs last week....& returning back to the regular schedule today........  He gifted me a cool pair of diamond ear rings.....For my part, i threw out a grand dinner for him on the eve of our anniversery.....with all of his favourite dishes......here cakes are very cheezy & creamy. So i baked a pine apple cake myself with a whipped cream topping.....we called our parents, later that day & went to temple (nearby city)....when we came back, we had a surprise.......our friends, were waiting for us at our door step.....they had also bought a cake...made us cut it......it was, "my" dining room & "my" kitchen....& "they" were moving in & out busy arranging the snacks & stuffs....i was just watching them...I had the least idea of what was happening for quiet some time....      Saturday morning, as planned, we started out to a natural resort......It's called the red river gorge & the danial Boone forest.....we spent two wonderful days there, doing hiking & other stuffs.....we came back on sunday evening.....it's a deep forest....& we've to hike there....to see a natural bridge.....it's called so because, there's a bridge formed out of rocks connecting two mountains, naturally......we hiked for 1hr to reach that place....wow!! it was so wonderful....just a natural rock connecting two mountains.....no extra safety....we fall from there, we're gone!!!it was like walking on a wide board in the air......melae aagasam, Kelae Boomi, naduvulae naan......i had a real tuff time, controlling Ganesh, not to go to the ends.....     will upload a few photos in my album today....& u can see them 'morrow.....Rini, indha photos aavadhu paaka try pannu di.......      My excitement is still not over...This thursday, my anna & my bro-in-law are coming here...... waiting for their arrival......they wanted to have good home food .....they had a given me a list to be prepared...& guess what's the first item in the list...."Idly & sambaar"!!!!       Fall semmester begins in a couple of days...will take an off when the guys are here.....       need to clean my home now.....it's in a total mess after the week end.....
