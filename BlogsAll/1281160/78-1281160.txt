dear friends    i have been a passive participant in this blogger for a long time ,that is because of my tight schedule where im moving between bangalore ,chennai and madurai.since i have a very less time to browse ,i usually read the bloggs and logout.but now since valli brought a discussion regarding tamil i'm now spending some time in replying for that.   regarding vallis words" shld complain abt this to Rajesh's edhiri katchi (who's struggling hard to make tamil as the first lang for the entire schooling for the future generations).....what do u guys think abt that?....", i will particularly and strongly say that the party which valli is mentioning has not done anything in interest of tamil people. They kindled the feelings of tamil society in 1960's and just used that to convert thier movement (neethi katchi) as a political party (DMK) and gained political mileage out of that.    They protested the entry of hindi and saying that they had spoilled our tamil community. Like students from other parts of the country we dont have the courage to move or relocate ourself to any part of the country.Our generation is totally spoilled by their political stance.I guess that the next generation would be competive enough like any other in our country.It doesnt mean that evryone should study everything in tamil here to make it grow.    The  growth of a language depends on the growth of the society which uses that language and so the so called move made by Karunanidhi doesnt sound sensible.so i strongly condemn the usage of words "who's struggling hard " in vallis blog.    And regarding the growth of tamil i do consider it as a serious problem that is to be addressed personally by us. just try if u can exactly translate and write one page of a english business correspondance to tamil? i can surely say that its not possible.   i faced the problem when one of our cute lady customer in our browsing centre asked me a help .i struggled for hours and finished it (exactly because of the mental motivation provided by that cute girl).but i felt bad for not able to translate one letter in my mother tongue.   our generation is not able to speak or write in tamil without using some english words in it.we have to try this from us and then we have to teach our children ,the art of using tamil and only tamil.(valli and sindu has an early chance to implement this ).we have to stop using english words when we are speaking informally.   remember tamil has crossed lot of boundaries and still it has adopted accordingly and so i beleive that this language which is the oldest and finest never die, because           "TAMILUKKUM AMUDHENDRU PEIR           ANTHA TAMIL ENGAL UYIRUKKUM MEL"  I thank valli for starting this politiced topic which provoked me to blog now.  general  im in chennai now and this sunday i met bala,vijay ,ganesh ,ajayan and manny here.we enjoyed a lot and there is good film "KADHAL KONDEIN" which deserves to be awarded the best .so if possible ,try to see that film and share your views in this blogger.  bye  rajesh  Dr.PURATCHI THALAIVI AMMA VALGHA
