Hi jax, i think u might see this post today evening, ya go thru the contact list i have created in our groups section. Kindly if u r free, add info of missing friends like sam and bala. as i dont have souvenir, i collected info from slam book. so theirs isnt there as they havent signed in mine. so update theirs from the souvenir. If not jax, those who have the souvenir can also do that. similarly update the calendar also with the birthdays of missing people. I found around 6 person's info missing in my slam book. As i havent worked on girls i cant quote whom i had missed exactly.   Friends suggestions are welcome to make any changes to the database from all the bloggers!  I snatched sometime to do this task before i go on for leave, coz this is a task which i had promised to do earlier but has made it only now.  And if possible, its better to influence our friends to sign in with yahoo id to access all the features. So bloggers who havent yet subsctibed up with yahoo id to our group, kindly do it!  and i have posted my invy to all. Valli i have posted to ur inlaws address properly dee, sindhu to ur parents address as u dint revert me with any change of address. I dont have balachander and sam's address. Can anyone, mail me theirs? And sandil's address too, coz i have only madurai address.
