Check it out.   Hei guys, yesterday i was in full shopping spree. Actually it was unplanned and all of a sudden, we decided to go for shopping to one of the malls where they had put curtains for sale. I bought some 4 curtains for two windows and on our way back, we crossed allen solly womens wear showroom. I was in pant-shirt formals. So when srini just asked, hei u had been planning to buy some pants for the past few days, how about trying now?, i said "yes".  All these days i had been saying no, since i cant give a try when i am in other outfits, but then yesterday i thought let me. So went in and started selecting. Meanwhile, the lady there, said, there is an offer like, one garment free with every two we buy. So srini decided to get me two. Great! I took sky blue jean color, a bit elephant grey and dark blue mix color, a bit dark sandal color. Threee pants! I have given it for alteration and will be getting them back today evening. And ya tomorrow morning we and his friends will be going to a near by Hill station in coorg (in tamil its kudagu malai) called      Madikeri    and i am going to try all my new dresses on this trip.  Oh yesterday i had a nice time removing hefty load from srini's pockets! Then we had dinner @ Shiv sagar. One tasty tasty vegetable dosa and a Gudbud ice cream. Bangaloreans, those who visit the Shiv sagar hotel in commercial can give a try at Vegetable dosa. It was very tasty and costed only 20Rs. ICe cream was ok, when compared to the all time tasty fig&Honey ice creamw hich srini had. Then came home merrily and so does my shopping story ends for the day!  Ok then see u all later Ranjini
