Dear Ram,     Friday is too soon. I was expecting it to be ready by Monday. Then the only option is let Manny prepare a rough draft of the paper. Ask him to mail it to my personal id. I'll go through, make necessary corrections, changes etc and mail it back to him.    For your mozilla query, open    the blog  in Mozilla and bookmark it. Then go the  B ookmarks menu and click on  M anage  B ookmarks... Right click on the newly created bookmark and click on  P roperties. Go to the  S chedule tab and set it according to your preferences. The  N otify tab can be used to alert you whenever the page has been modified.&nbsp; Though this feature is very useful, it gets a little annoying at times, whenever an alert pops up.     Everyone, check out the new   Members   link at the left hand side. Your comments and suggestion for utliizing the space effectively are welcome.&nbsp;     The small subscription box on the right is for those who want to receive updates made to the blog through email. If anyone, say Ganesh, wants to know whether there are any new posts to the blog, he can subscribe using the form. He will then be receiving mails about the updates to the blog through emails.    As I had mentioned earlier, please use the &lt;br&gt; tag to seperate sentences. As you all can see all the posts appear as a single para. Use the HTML knowledge we learnt at MS(IT&amp;M) atleast now.    Bye,    Jax.
