Right from the beginning and still now the education system in India has been tailored with the â€œOne size fits allâ€ kind of attitude, which no longer works well with the emerging global competition. This might be due to the huge population we have which prevents us from customizing the education system according to the talents of the individual. The student was restricted with limited number of choices and he has to go with what he getsâ€¦irrespective of his/her likes or dislikes. And this leads people who want something more on education to look around other countries for more prospects.   For instance, there are more than 20.000 plus vacant seats in engineering colleges in our state alone. This does not mean that there are no people to opt for these courses. Rather there are hell lot of other factors such as the quality of education in these institutions and the infrastructure as well. Anna University has summoned 40 engineering colleges which donâ€™t have the required infrastructure to make it up to the mark, that u all shud be aware ofâ€¦  This clearly sends a message that, the education in India is not only lagging in its value but also being commercialized. For that matter, our government has granted permission to private medical colleges and the fees per year for a medical student is figured out to be around 80k. so for five years it comes around 4 lacs. This is something which a poor or middle class people cant afford toâ€¦I feel. But I donâ€™t get into the details of which government gave this permission and whatâ€™s the deal that went on behind the screensâ€¦at last its we who are going to suffer from the treatment going to be offered by these half made up doctors who might come out of these private medical colleges with an MBBS degree which they will get out of the money they haveâ€¦ha ha.  So, be prepared to go thru a newly constructed bridge that might collapse while u are passing by it and be prepared to secure your kidneys from doctors who might come out of private medical collegesâ€¦ha ha. Ok cutysâ€¦bye bye.
