Hi,        Today I chat with sindhu after a long time. It’s a great surprise for me. It’s nearly been 10 months I talked to sindhu…Jax,Why can’t we arrange a group chat soon???I am eagerly waiting for rini's marriage to meet you all.           Here in chennai since I am staying in a new hostel. I am missing all my old hostel friends and it's boring here at times. Yesterday I went for shopping..spent a lot in sarees. I was in T.Nagar for the whole day.I met few of my friends.We planned to go for 'Sangamam' infy music show.But we cudn't find time. Today just I am relaxing.TV in our hostel is not functioning properly..so I came out to check mails.    Valli, it's great to hear all your stories. It reminds our college days. Enjoy!!  Hope you have to manage your time now . Managing b/w cooking and reading!! What’s the timings for your course??  Then how you commute to your univ?     Rini,How is the preparations are going? Hope you are enjoying all the marriage rituals..Have a Nice time! I will be coming to mdu on Sunday morning. I had a project party on Wednesday in Residency..It’s was nice .We took few snaps..I will put few of my snaps in yahoo groups soon. Really it’s a great idea to have database…We can contact anyone ,wherever we are. Just now I updated my database. I cudn’t participate in all the initiatives since I don’t have net access. Let me know if I can do something for our groups..  See you..
