Hi friends,  Yesterday as i was free i happened to read whole of "Perseus the Deliverer". the story of which i have already published before. It was a classic piece.   Especially the Character of Cassiopea who is the queen of Syria and mother of Iolaus(friend of perseus) and andromeda  (lady love of perseus) is one of the best portrayed character in the play.   U should see the dialogues delivered by her when she finds that her golden stressed iolaus is going to be slained..... She becomes so fierce and with the will and inteligence of a queen and heart of a mother, she stands for her son. Ok i cant just like that express what i have relished in mere words. So let me stop with this.      Hei i did buy one casette yesterday too. Its called Sarvasri by Balamurali krishna.  I listened to it when i went to bed. Wow so soothing is the music on Lord Ganesha.  But will be very good to listen as the day starter as Ganesha is the beginner of all deeds!   Oh, but the pitiable part is the quality of casette is not good and i need to exchange it for a new one.   Inspite of that i enjoyed listening to the music.  This is the first time i am listening to his voice.   Its also good. We bought two more casettes by Sanjay Subramaniam whose musical voice we both enjoy like anything.   one is Kalyani and the other is Ashwaththa i believe. Once Srini has had the delight of listening,   i am planning to relish too. Till then got to wait!   Ok guys see u later. Cares and shares  Ranjini
