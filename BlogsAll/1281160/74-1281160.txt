Good topic in rounds now. I pity Sindu wandering in want of the acquaintance of language in a foreign land. Instead of commenting on other's view, here i present my own view regarding languages.   Language as such was created as a means of communicating when Human beings wanted to advance their way of communication. So as far as Language is concerned i dont have preference for any particular language though i at present i have affinity towards Sanskrit because of its usage in music. Hope u all know my recent interest in Carnatic music. It sounds divine to me. But then it has never stopped me from reading or interacting with people who speak different languages.   Every language is unique in its own nature and its the convienience of usage which matters most. I remember vaguely reading what Bernard shaw said in reply to which English is the best, "The English which can be understood is the best english" It can be made generic and can be applicable to all languages. I have always felt that instead of attaching myself to one particular language let me learn to accept things which are expressed via them.   So be it Sanskrit or Tamil or English or any language, its the content which is transferred signifies most and not the language, which is a mean of transfer. so friends i really feel, i am yet to discover so many excellent master pieces in various languages! Ofcourse i may not be able to master all languages to know how good they are, but ofcourse translated versions will do for me!   This is my humble view!
