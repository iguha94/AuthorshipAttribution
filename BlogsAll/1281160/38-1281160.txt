After 4 great days...now again, left all alone with my computer.....On saturday, we hosted a party. Though not a formal one, i still had a lot of work that day. sunday, we spent our time shopping(just the usual grocery :-( nothing interesting!!) & bowling. There's a new Indian restaurant opened......we tried it out on sunday....the food was better than the other Indian restaurants, but all these can never match, our good old Gowry Ganga & British Bakery....On monday, we watched a couple of scary movies..."I still know what u did last summer" & "Sixth Sense".....they r older ones, but still worth watching. Especially, the sixth sense...If u have'nt watched it, i wud recommend the movie.....Tuesday, we went to Cincinnati, Ohio,  for the green card formalities.....After completing it, we went to an acquarium....The newport Acquarium, has some rare species of turtles & fishes, in it. It was like, walking inside the sea.... a wonderful experience.....There were a lot of sharks too....imagine a shark just above ur head or at a distance where his teeth cud be seen so clearly......Just a piece of glass seperating us... what wud've happened, if the glass above or below me had  broken???.....Before getting back to Lexington, we went to the Temple of Cincinnati.   hey Xavier, idea for filling out the empty space is really good.....&  abt Bastinado......i believe in ahimsa Xavier....BTW, Sangee wants to join us....she wanted some help with it.....Can u plz help her Xavier?....like how u mailed me....  My parents have now moved to Rajapalayam....My dad was promoted & transferred, a couple of months before my marraige. Since, my brother's schooling is over, my mom is moving there now....so next time i come to India, i won't have much, to do in Madurai, other than stopping for a few hrs, to visit my Grand parents & uncle...  Vijay Babu.....how was ur brother's mrg?....so ur path is cleared now, & there is'nt much time for u to become a kelavanaar (as per ur research)!!!....  bye
