Manny, thanx for the ids.....muluchikko, olunga velaya paaru......  Xavier, yeah, that's one way i shld have got the IDs....Anyway....i got 'em now...  Had my first fall session yesterday.....know what....there are two other Indian ladies, with me in my Java class.....but they are all "Good looking middle aged women" & so i'm the only "Beautiful young gal"( in Rajesh's words).....  Vijay, i don't think i'll able to give any sugeestions to our juniors....i can just advise them,  not to marry an NRI  immidaitely after graduation, that too if she's very particular abt her career in IT. U cannot become a programmer  here, unless u have experience or that country's education.    Maybe i can give some inputs to our HOD.....ways to improve the standard of education given....& more particularly, how to get the best out of the students.....from a student's point of view.....   I won't say our standard was bad.....it was actually very good....that too for our batch, with the best faculties & subjects.....but we could have done even more better...guess, u all will agree with me....  that's it vijay....nee varuva, aedhavadhu public news vaasipa, oodiduva.....tell us something abt ur work, interesting & crazy stuffs u've been doing lately....atleast how many times u played shuttle cock, yesterday...something like that........else, i wud have to rename ur nickname from Roja Babu to Bulletien Board Babu (BBB)...nalla irukku illa!!!.....  need to prepare some yummy dishes for our brothers....i may not  blog for one week from now......  bye.
