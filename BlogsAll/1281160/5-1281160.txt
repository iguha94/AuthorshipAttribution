Hi friends,  Hei what a nice inning by aussies! Really they deserved it i beleive. Anyway most of the time , i flet the cup is for indians. Its really good that atleast theyw ent to final! Every body played well in their team and so our guys could not meet them with the same vigour. Its ok.  So coz, of this match most of the people's weekend would have got spoilt......... But for a real cricket fan, aussi innings would have been a good feast. U know what, when we were travelling in bus to ISKCON yesterday morning, near M.G. road, u should see the josh of Bangaloreans....... There was a long proecession with a band of people playing, India will win and some thing like that. Then they were carrying a long flag around 50 - 60 metres length and in the end there was a tempo where in 4 purohits were sitting & doing a homam kind of thing. Even while returning in the afternoon, we could see so many indian flags fluttering. Reaally i felt them to be a bit stupid. Anyway its their way of expressing things and what does it have to do with me.   But i watched whole of aussie innings and then watched till tendul got out. After that it was becoming so obvious that we will give away the cup to them. so got back to my personal work. So i dont feel i missed or messed my weekend! How about u people?
