dear friend   In Annanagar ,where i'm staying in chennai an interesting event took place.im putting it in the blog.you say your views about it.We have autorickshaws here to take school childrens to thier school.They were charging 400Rs per student till now to take them to a distance of 2 K.M nearly (to and fro).But after Share autos were introduced now a share auto person collects a minimum of 5 Rs for a person to cover that distance.So on calculating it takes 10 Rs per day for to and fro,which comes to 10 * 5 days/week = 50 Rs/week.so in total it becomes 200Rs/month which is almost 50%.On a concession he had agreed to get 150 Rs /month.But this auto persons who were on business till now are forming informal associations and threatening the share auto person not to do the job.They had also decreased the fare to 300 Rs which is still in expensive.due to the autocratic behaviour the school childrens are finding difficulties to go to school on time.   Now the matter is before our appartments association.Now we have to choose from the below decisions. 1.We have to go by the autoRickshaw persons statements and pay them 300Rs/month.  2.We have to give a criminal complaint against the auto rickshaw GANG in police ,where they will be arrested and remanded.here they will be treated as criminals.(the shareauto person is ready for service whenever we are ready to give him a legal protection)  so i want xavier,Mahendran,ramgopal.ranjini,kishore,valli,ganesh,sindu,vijaybabu to study the case and reply in this blog there opinion.  bye and take care raapi
