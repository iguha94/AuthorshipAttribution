hi friends, just now came to terms with the fact that its monday morning and i have plenty of work piled up...im still not out of the weekend mood.... on sat..we had been to Birmingham to send off one of Boomi's friend who was leaving to India.....after dropping him off at Airport we started to Oxford...to visit yet another Boomi's friend.....the Oxford city is flooded with colleges....it has around 25 colleges with huge campuses...old buildings...only one college is built recently with modern architecture.... amidst huge oppsition from the public. Oxford is a bit smaller when compared to Cambridge....New college is located in Cambridge(Nehru studied here)..the whole city is so lively with students all round the globe...cambridge is the largest city with Cycle population in Europe.... on Sunday morning V called our parents..Boomi complained to my parents that im not cooking these days....so gave him a bang on his back.....then we went to Churchill gardens...the place where were Winston churchill was born...the place is so huge that u have small shuttle train running inside the campus....there is a place where golf game is open for public.....so i got geared up and started playing with Boomi as my opponent....v ended up fighting with the golf strikers(i dont what u call that!)..... after that it was time for us get back to hinckley..its 2 hrs drive from Oxford.... for the past 2 days the weather was ok...but today again it is cold, rainy and windy...so asked Boomi to drop me in my office.....so here iam still strugling with the stupid accent once again.....  cheers Sindu
