dear jax,   here is what i felt about the new layout. Its not as impressive as the old one. But since u have tried to inject color i do agree that it will take time to aclimatise that look.  But here are few suggestions from me regarding the layout.   1. The font of All in a day's work (the title pane) is not so appealing. Please change it. It can be any one of Arial, Times New Roman, Comic Sans, Book man old style or Monotype corsiva. My vote is always for the MTC which is a bit curvical , but since all our other fonts are in straight alphabet facetype, i dont know how appealing it will look. Anyway try for various combinations and see. But change this font. I feel the spacing between the character's is more and they look hefty and short.   2. The boxes in which u are trying to fit things, doesnt appeal me. The space after the Menu box gave me an impression that the site spans horizontally beyond that box and so made me search for  Horizontal scroll bar. This can be avoided, if the box is eliminated and left free. As the background u have given differs for different boxes, i dont think its necessary to have borders outside every thing.   3.That green color is a bit fluorescent and so its brightness can be reduced to make the site have a much soothing look.  4. And what is this, it seems as if the blog content is cornered. Oram kattita maathiri oru feeling. May be , its becoz of the earlier layout, i am having this. but i was comfortable with earlier layout than this. So try if u could center it, which is the center for this site too.   5. Menus are not working in my page here. What could be the problem?  6. Cant we block the ad which appears at the top of the page? or cant we position it else where?  7. Why cant i view the source?  8. What happened to the vistiors track?  Ok got some work now, will get back to u when i am free Ranjini
