hi,  hope everyone in our blogger family is doing well.  sorry for didnt post msg for long time. i dont want to tell any reason for that. because,  entrepreneurs dont find reasons for not doing things.                                        - Jayaraman (i dont know the actual person who said it. i only know the person who told this one to us)                                                                                i hav an interesting topic to discuss. we completed our course almost 1.5yrs ago. now everyone is having industrial experience(few has higher studies experience). assume that one fine day our HOD invite us to give a speech on career guidance to our juniors. what ll u say? what could be the core of ur speech?  while preparing for it, u hav to keep one thing in mind, ie., the dilemma we had till the last day of our couse. whether to select IT or mgmt?  people who forgot those days, pls go through the following incident. one year before, while everyone begin to search for their first job, one guy from IT profession asked one of our classmate that what is his/her specialization? for that our classmate responded as still I havnt decided between IT and Management. that guy now asked tell atleast in which area u did ur projects, because of our unique features, our classmate told that i did projects both in IT and Management. now that guy got angry(because he is a poor IT guy, he dont know anything more than that) and told, hey I am not at all asking abt Management, hav u did any IT projects or not, if so then in which platform u did it, what technology u interested? Microsoft or Java? Likewise he is going on adding questions related to S/W field, that we hardly knew. now this is the situation, we passed through those hard times and learned a lot in this 1.5 yrs of time. what ll u say now?   i expect everyone to participate and post their speech.   feelings:- ---------- class munnadi vanthu ninnu pesi yevvalavu nazh achchu. neenga pesinathu yellam innum kan(eye) munnadi nikkuthu. innoru santharpam kidaikkiradhu romba kastam, so atleast bloglaiyavathu post pannunga, atha en karpanaila neenga classla pesura mathiri ninaichchukkuven.
