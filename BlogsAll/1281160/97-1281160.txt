Hi all,                   Xavier, layout seems good now.......Is this orange ur favourite color?....adha mattum maathavae maataengura??.......If possible try some other shades of orange.....Green is good now.......Do we need the dotted horizontal line after every title?......As Rini, said, it would be nice, if the font size is increased......Other than these minor differences, i find the layout appealing.......good job done man!!!!           Good job done by Mahen also.......such a big post from him, for the first time, with only one "Ha ha"......his trademark sirippu......Nice to hear a plastic bag free beach......          Hey Rini, Great photos di........Especially, the couples photo after the marriage looks elegant.....Are u wearing a Madisaar style saree or the ordinary one?.........awaiting to see more of yours........Pallavarukku nalladhoru uvamai koduthu puriya vaithu vittai......sabaash Thozhi.......(just kidding  Mahendran!!)           About the case study, trying to put myself in the autorickshaw man's shoes, it's quiet nominal to charge Rs.300 or Rs.400, 'coz of the constraints, lesser accomadation, petrol fuel etc......now, getting into the parents shoes, i'll surely try to go in for the cheaper commutation......The part where the autorickshaw association goes wrong, from my view, is "They have no rights to demand.....not the least one to order or force the parents to use autos".......so according to my observation, the change has to take place from the autoriskshaw man's side.......Their association, instead of demanding, has to do some attractive changes, that'll pull back the customers. Or if they try to do this, The customers will have no other way, rather than to get the corps. So my solution is (provided this same situation exists),  to go for the SECOND CHOICE.....           Saturday, we were invited by an aunty for Varalakshmi pooja.....happened to meet a lot of tamil families....got new contacts......  poittu vaaaraen...... valli.
