It's my birthday! YAAAAAAAAAY!  It's my birthday! YAAAAAAAAAY!  It's my birthday! YAAAAAAAAAY!  It's my birthday! YAAAAAAAAAY!  Excerpt from the show  CrankYankers   Yup, Gary had me watching that and from now on all birthday'ers will suffer the wrath of the most annoying phone call to be gotten at 6 AM on one's birthday. Last night was great. Fish and Lenny (who will now be known as Fenny (ala Bennifer ie. J-lo and Ben Affleck) or other famous couples such as Guy and Salome aka Guylome . Well Fenny got me flowers. I've never gotten flowers before. I also had another birthday first but that's none of your bloggers ya know? I was drunk as all hell (just three drinks but they were special birthday drinks. THANKS MAUREEN!!) AND i did a poem. First thing i said of course in true rebel fashion was "FUCK THE TIME PENALTY" and implicitly fuck everyone else tooo..... I've had it up to here with the hateration. Nuyo took it last nite and deservingly I thought. They're energy was fresh and so were the faces and you know? that's what happens when the rotation changes every year. Implicitly there's a faith in the poetry community to keep producing new poets with new work, THAT system supports newness and change.....whatever...we've been down THAT road...SO back to my birthday....Personally i've been traumatized by birthdays past so now i don't even care these days. Besides, the people i care about know i do the other 364 days of the year and vice versa so by the time any holiday including a birthday comes along it's kind of redundant? It's a marker though and if you read yesterday's blog you can see were i've been , where I'm at etc. Today's not a day for reflecting. It's a day for returning voicemails from everyone wishing me a happy birthday. I didn't know i had this many friends...or maybe I was too self absorbed to realize it. I have a full wonderful life and I'm really happy for it.  I think that's it..... maybe more later  Diane
