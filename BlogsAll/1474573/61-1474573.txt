I wonder if this is becoming a habit...Okay, so Diane asked me to write for her again.  Could you consider this ghost writing since I'm actually saying who I am?  We do have similar names and all...   Anyway, la la la...Dont have much to say so I'll tell you a funny story that happened to me and Diane this morning.  She worked out this morning and while she was downstairs she was logged into another computer (or something like that).  So she forgot to log out, right? And she gets back to her room and she IMs me...  So she and I are typing back and forth and then all of a sudden she writes, "I dont know who you want to talk to, but I'm not her" and I'm like, "then  she writes something like, "I think you are trying to reach the RA, I'm an administrative assistant here, and I'm not her." and I'm like, "Diane, what the fuck, you have TRULY lost it now, gurl." and she's all like, "what?" so then I'm thinking, ok maybe Matt's over and is fucking with me on the computer so I'm like, "Okay, Diane, what kind of game are you playing?" and she's all like, 'What are YOU talking about?" as if I'M the nutjob (no comments, GUY!) So anyway, she really seems confused so I copy and paste what "she" wrote and lo and behold she DIDN'T write it.  She was logged in at two computers at the SAME TIME and neither one could see what the other was writing, just my responses.  Isnt that weird?  Diane claims its some new thing that AOL 9.0 has.  I HATE IT.  That means people, like this silly little admin. who didnt know how to log Diane off, can be talking to my friends while I'm not around!  What kinda shit is that, she thought to herself while typing...  Anyway, alls I'm saying is, that watch out where you log yourself in, because your friends may get very confused and call Bellevue on you because they think you have some dissociative disorder or something.    Thats it for me this afternoon. Stay tuned for your regularly scheduled Diane soon enough.
