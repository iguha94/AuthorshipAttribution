I've been writing alot lately, thanks to hanging out with   matt  so much. Hanging out with other poets is healthy and you can be poetically nerdy together. I started re-reading neon vernacular by Yusef Komunyaka. I had to read it for a class and honestly, I didn't like him much. His jazz poems were much too esoteric for my taste ( and most still are ) and there was something supremely elitist about it. Maybe it doesn't make sense but that was my primary emotional response to his work.......now I'm reading him again and I'm getting inspired. As far as my process goes, when I get  blocked I like to read other poets and respond to them.   Here it is.....new poem...post comments :)   The mercy of light/ a monday nite at 13/incident II   the candles only bring doubt to him what is he missing on this first date? which flaws go by unnoticed?  she understands  what the absence of light adds how candlelight  includes the rosiness of checks the smooth part of skin shines over ashy patches makes stomach rolls under black satin smooth as the light distracts him from the plane of  one dimensional physicality  the decision to cash in the second drink chip sits on a foundation built on an  increasingly wobbly stack of   "so whats"  reeking of cigarrette smoke   enveloped in the security of a dark bar with red lights in the bathroom no one knows flaw each a hazy glowing version of themselves they welcome one night affairs with intentions as punch-drunk as they are  who knows what happens tuesday morning? who cares?  the mercy of light favors the unfavorable candles  wash away the lines that begin to show in cracked smiles it convinces you that each  gasp each sigh explosion of buffooning laughter each accidental encounter is  more then incident  I was supposed to be at the   nuyorican  but damn it's cold. I called   rich  to see how bad the line was .......If i don't see you   rich  good luck!
