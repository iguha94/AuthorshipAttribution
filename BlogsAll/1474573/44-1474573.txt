If this requires too much brain power........ then read it anyway.......it's a fun poem   [Reflection on a Gift of Matricide # 2]  Norman  I.  EXT- THE OLD HOUSE- NORMAN 16 YEARS OLD-(THE MORNING AFTER)  A sons a poor substitute for a lover, Mother empty space should have taken my place  He cant fuck you like I did he tried he tried  I fucked you over like he did It only took one time one time  I could love some other but A boys best friend Is his mother    II.  INT.  THE PARLOR- (NIGHT)   I WONT LET YOU HAVE HER! I cant  be in two places At once wombs wont act concentric like circles two women  cant  run the same kitchen  someones bound to get swallowed  someones bound  to get squashed  If you see the porch light on Dont come Shes sweet Shes good Shes  done nothing wrong  III.   INT. OFFICE OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)   Come into my parlor said the spider to the fly  Id love to have you for dinner  You can have room  number one  The one with the peephole Come undone  You have that something most girls dont have That thing that puts a man ease  12 rooms 12 vacancies  And I have the lowest prices plenty of closets to store your vices  Check other places  if you must but dont I have a smile that you can trust?
