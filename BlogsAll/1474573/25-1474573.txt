Ok, I just started back up in the gym. I think i emasculated some poor little boy. It was like my third day back in the ring and I got paired with this 16 yr old boy. Granted he was big, but he was kinda new, not really experienced and they had him sparring against me. Now mind you I'm not a bully, I wasn't going hard or anything but I gave the poor boy a bloody nose and he  was just like "I don't hit girls" and my instinctive reaction was "BULLSHIT YOU JUST CANT FIGHT!". Part of me was like alright, I understand. I would never encourage a guy to hit a girl but the other part of me was like , "We're in a gym and this is what we do."There doesn't seem to be that middle ground. Either guys don't know what to do with you and won't fight you or they hate you for being there and they pound on you. Anyway, bottom line is that I've only sparred with one girl. I've only sparred with guys. They hit me and hard but I'm always kind of afraid that they aren't going all out and that i won't be prepared when i actually fight a girl. I know that I'm bigger and meaner then most girls (in the ring anyway) and I wonder how i'd feel hitting a girl. ...... ....I'll think about that another time.....  I've got other things on my mind ...  OH YEAH!! I saw American Wedding I laughed I laughed till i cried I almost puked.....  Don't go there to be enlightened see it to be grossed out  beautiful debauchery..... nite nite little ones
