Last night i heard probably the DUMBEST thing i have ever heard in my life. "So, Diane why should I believe your truth vs. a truth on t.v. (i.e. GW.) and i replied because "I have a stake in the truth" i should have finished the sentence with a triumphant "JACKASS".

I can blame my hubris on my youth, what's your excuse? Fake time penalties will not save you this time. Your true colors come out in moments like these and at some point you will be outed by the same people who encourage your hubris. Don't end up like narcissus, drowning in your own reflection.  moving on.......  I know what brings people to 13  every monday nite....it's nice to go where everyone knows your name, and they're always glad you came however  i don't want to go where i can see the troubles are still the same but i still go where everyone knows my name   i foolishly believe that's it's bigger  then itself and over and over i'm shown it's not. .....maybe i should troop it more often to Acentos...... but then again i may knock out that bitch ass bartender....   "champagne for my real friends" "real pain for my sham friends"  Vielen Dank ist das meine zwei Cents
