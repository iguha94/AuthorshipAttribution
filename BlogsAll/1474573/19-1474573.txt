And in the darkness......friendster them! Jesus christ...this friendster thing totally exploits every vulnerability you have. I mean Come ON!     Add Friend  To add Tani as a friend, please enter Tani's email address or full name.   Continue only if you really are friends with Tani.     If you really    are friends with whoever? then they spot check you and ask for said "Tani's" approval and validation that you IN FACT really are friends? of course you wait for your email box to fill up with "TANI IS NOW YOUR FRIEND" messages in Yahoo. So was Tani ever really your friend? Is she NOW your friend because she's comfortable enough with you to let other friendsters know that  you two are in fact MORE then acquaintances? Because who you friendster with is a window into who you ARE as a person. From now own, I'm going to make sure that I'm clear on my relationships with people. I mean it's only fair in this world of capitalism that EVERYTHING including our relationships with people should be codified. You know? arranged, collected, organized, classified so that we as humans and our emotions can be properly commodified. YES ! take what is intangible, indeterminate, evanescant and package it and resell to us what is ours. Basically, all our insecurities.......   "Fat," the mechanic says, "liposuctioned fat sucked out of the richest thighs in America. The richest, fattest thighs in the world."  Our goal is the big red bags of liposuctioned fat we'll haul back to Paper Street and render and mix with lye and rosemary and sell back to the very people who paid to have it sucked out. At twenty bucks a bar, these are the only folks who can afford it.    Yes...our vulnerabilites exploited and sold back to us....the wheel goes round and round...and it's addictive!  Why? Our need for validation. Nothing ACTUALLY goes on on friendster.....you see how many "friends" you can rack up....  oh well I'm going to check my email and see if anyone's my frined :)
