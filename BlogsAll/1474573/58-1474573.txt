Tesseract  On the third dimension plane The shortest distance between Point B and point A Is a straight line And time Only moves in one direction But I have a tendency to meander   Forgive me For loving you  In the future tense When the smart girl in freshman English class Caught up to the woman I want to am Who knows how to love hard And listen soft Who knew  how to understand the man you were And love the man you are  I love to love you slow And to live fast  I like to love you multi versed Polyphonically If my love  Were a building It would be a panopticon I would love you from all 8 walls The ceiling and the floor Love you so consistently That when I was gone You would love yourself out of habit   3rd dimension beings loving on a 4th dimension planet  I visit the 5th nightly to see you  If I could I would build a laser So strong That its light would travel  infinitely around your curves Continue around the earth And come back to you Id put a thousand mirrors In its path So that You can see yourself The way I see you Front and back   Feel the pulse of a heartbeat Other than mine Dissect spider webs Until theyre string To learn humanity Through laughing at myself Instead of you Because The arrhythmia you cause Just isnt funny  Stretch your back out my canvas Trace the line Between love and fascination Find the atlas of your fingerprint Finger your life map  Wonder in the what ifs Of tesseracts Bend my back  Like the time space continuum  So that a trip to the moon  Would only  Cost  $1.50 And space was just a detail And time  Made the comma The semi-colon The period useless  In this dimension there would be no time nor distance to make the heart grow fonder only you
