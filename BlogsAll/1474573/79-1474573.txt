It's Botox and it's Topical! It's Botopical!     -Infomercial at 4:52 AM.     So I lied. I'm still around. One thing about hiding out is that it's boring and it leaves ample time for dvd renting and provides alot of blog fodder. So deal  I've made up a new word. It's called  Rutting.  That's what I'm doing  right now. Rutting.It comes from the noun rut as in   I am currently in a rut   I've changed it into a verb so, I am now in the proces of rutting. My rutting is turning out to be a somewhat fruitful venture. It's allowing for some painful introspectionand self-analysis.   "The artist is always eons ahead of the (wo)man"  Bullshit.    Me, myself and I are  far ahead of my artistry. I live much braver then I write. *sighI need to get out of dodge. I've been in new york way too long. Same situations, different faces, it's all become to formulaic,no longer organic.....hence the rutting.    Changes     1.  I know I have  nasty habit of interrupting people. It's not because  I'm not listening (though it comes off that way) I listen! I swear!If I didn't think you had anything intelligent to say , I wouldn't talk to you! at all! Believe me! I'm a very judgemental person with slight episodes of megalomania; If I didn't respect what you had to say, I'd let you know (loudly if I found you particularly obnoxious, or simply politely ignore you. If you don't see me around, it's probably because i think that you're dumb)I simply experience some sort of turrets in which I THINK i'm making mental notes and  they just come SHOOTING out of my mouth. hence me screaming   "YOU'RE SEXY"  or  "Yeah! I'm totally feeling you!" "he IS the worst poet I ever heard" or "You know, I wrote a poem  about JUST that"    I apologize.  I'm working on it.  Now, when I talk on the phone, I press mute. I can interject with my peanut gallery comments  without disrespecting the other person or ruining their flow. Ah, compromise and progress.    2.  I'm getting into comic books. Mostly because of my experience filming.  Though I can't draw very well the visual medium is such a powerful tool and I'm learning alot  through my own storyboarding (One is that i'm good at story boarding) One story board that  impressed me was on the 28 days later DVD . There was a radical alternate ending that was  never filmed but was story boarded and quite well. On my list of comics to get when I get paid are   Fallen Angels  The latest issue of  American Splendor    Aquaman   The Matrix  Comic (I'm thinking of starting my own)  Any suggestions please drop them off. I'm trying to stay away from the biggies, like batman, spiderman,superman,hellboy, the punisher... but I know that I might end up indulging  in Catwoman or X-Men.    3.  Took my brother to go see   Dawn of the Dead  which kicked the Passion of the Christ out of the number one spot. I was happy about that. Here's my opinion on J.C.  (*drum roll please?)  He died for something he believed in. Believed in enough to take on all the sins of man. (I say MAN  cuz those bastards blamed everything on women, I'll pull a Dave Chappelle and do the same thing.It's not   nuanced  some people might like   but oh well.) I'm not going to go see a movie that's going to use  violence to manipulate me into feeling sorry for the man, why?   IT COMES WITH THE TERRITORY! THAT's WHAT HAPPENS WHEN  YOU SIGN UP TO DIE FOR SOMETHING YOU BELIEVE IN!  Jeeeeeeeeesus! (no pun intended)  And besides I can't stomache that violence, nor can I stomache the violence that the  slaves endured on the Atlantic Slave trade, or the 500 years of abuse through out the Americas, nor can I stomache the violence of capitalism overseas . Wanna see violence? I'll show you violence!        Now THAT is violence!  I don't feel like getting manipulated into false pity, cuz that's what it would be: false. The visual media is powerful, and distorts invisibly and effortlessly. Tell me something about what Jesus stood for, what he believed in. Tell me about the loads of text between the  ages 12 and 33. Tell about what Jesus thought about the church, about all the secret texts the Vatican won't let out.Tell me about THAT! don't force me into pitying a willing martyr in order to cash in on this country's already low moral economy. Just another excuse to co-op faith. I'll keep my ten-bucks-thank-you-very-much  I'd rather go see zombies.   The movie was alright. The OVERT product placement got annoying but what can you do? It didn't have the political poignancy of George A Romero's Classic. It totally overlooked the poignancy of  the original Night of the Living Dead. Running zombies change the entire game when it comes to the historically political nature of the horror genre. If you want a qualifier for that last comment you'll have to ask for it specifically,  I'm too tired to go into zombie film theory. (can you SMELL the ranting frustration?)  so..... QUESTION!    (let's indulge in my post-apocalyptic fantasies)      A)  If the population of the world ceased to exist, how would it most likely go and why ?         a. There would be no more room in hell and the dead would walk the earth (ala Dawn of the Dead)        b. A plague or epidemic would wipe out the world turning everyone into running zombies (28 days Later)        c. A plague disguised as the flue (ala the Stand)        d. Massive Floods (Water World)        e. Killer Aliens trying to reap from our resources (Ala Independence Day/Signs)        f. Killer Aliens taking over our minds and turning us into slaves (ala Invasion of the Body Snatchers)        g. The second coming of the Ice Age (The Day afte Tomorrow coming out May 2004)        h. AI (Artificial Intelligence) goes completely awry and the computers we build control us (The Matrix/Reloaded/Revolutions)   B)  What would be your plan for survival?      C)  If you could build a team of 20 survivors (assuming your family is already counted outside of this 10) who would you pick to start a brand new world??  Only thing is they have to be living, no historical figures, cartoons, or republicans.     indulge me role players, indulge me.
