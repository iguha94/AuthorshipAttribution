Today is the the second to last Rikers class for this session. Although I'm sad "I'm glad it's coming to an end....it has been an amazing in experience,not in that corny look at me I'm a teacher   taylor mali  way (ok maybe a little) but in a selfish this-makes-me-feel-whole kind of way. I've had this huge gaping whole in my soul for so long........and I'm so tired of it. It didn't get filled up but somehow I found a way to forget about it.....I don't know what happened to it but I felt it fill up the first time I got in front of a classroom with 28(??) expectant faces who wanted me to prove them wrong , that maybe i had something to say, something to offer that would at least show them the way to salvation.     "Don't bring a knife to a gun fight and don't bring a two step to the copa"   Don't go into Rikers to teach feeling afraid of your students because they can never be students to you then and thus you can never be a teacher One basic principle that people (teachers/parent's) is expect the worst of your kids and they will deliver. It's so simple a concept but still i get suspicious raised eyebrows...from my mother. "What are you doing there? You better not be getting a boyfriend" Forgive her, she's a haitian archie bunker with the tact of vertically challenged italian mafioso ...from queens. It's not pretty. At least she got over thinking I was   bisexual  I'm supposed to be reading for them today along with fish, claudia and keito....it'll be interesting I've got to finish a teaching path for community word today but that's not happening tonight....  Nuyorican tonight anyone? Hit me off on my tag board
