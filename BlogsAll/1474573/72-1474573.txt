Ok, so this is it. Changes on my site. I changed the set up, now i have to change the content. What am I going for? Quality not quantity. I've already proven to myself that I can discipline myself to post everyday, question is can I discipline myself to put more time and effort? Maybe that's why  I wanted to two journals, one public and  one private but then again this serves as like a way to keep in touch with my friends without having to e-mail everyone who's not around with my business. I'll figure out a much more productive symbiosis   Just so you know what is actually different   1. No more annoying pointer. Since my computer ISN'T as old as   Guy's  children , it never bothered me but  it seemed to annoy alot of people, so I got rid of it.  2. Though the main image is big,the site is pretty skinny compared to my last one. If it's still too fat, please tell me so that I  can trim it.  3. I went for a more streamline look that had nuanced quirks. The other site was too ostentatious...kind of like matt's chatterbox. ;) I'm going for content so I'm trying to have less typos and what not on my blog. It won't happen over night but I'm working on it.  I have too much to say to say it as inarticulately as I do.....actually....i'm lying. The Queer Eye Guys came to my site and told me that I needed to change it.  4. Tagboard and comments are still here and I added a cute little   imood  a throwback to dawn's blog. I'll see how I feel about this  5. I 've also added a Prison Bitch Name Generator which I'm sure NO ONE has (see also the hobbit name generator that I have a link to) I don't know how long I'm going to keep this but we'll see. I welcome suggestions  I hope this keeps you entertained for a little bit.
