         You're probably wondering what this is? This is new years resolution number 42.   "When  you look in the mirror become what you were meant to be"    On a third dimension plane the shortest distance  between point  B to  _________point A  is a straight line and time  only moves in one direction              but I  have a tendency to meander   I've christened this blog Tesserblog after the Tessaract, a sorta psuedo scientific idea from the Madeline L'Engle book  A Wrinkle in Time   In it the characters Tessered, a term used for traveling through space by bending the time space continuum.  I thought that this could happen here. Take space out of the equation and create a virtual workshop. So when you wanna post a poem,you can post it here for critique. If you're feeling more social go check out personal blogs. Just one more thing to get addicted to   I've been working on my chap book, my first chap book, anxious to put some work behind me, to lay some poems to bed to commit them to whatever place they have in my literary life so that I can move on, intellectually, spiritually, emotionally and poetically, but I've been writing in a vacuum. My workshops have always been  informal....random dinners, long winded talks over beers and cigarettes. Seeing the growth of the public sphere online through blogging , I was struck with an idea? how about stepping it up a little and create a virtual workshop space. I know that we all post poems on our blogs randomly but the blogs (mine) have become a little too full? I kept having this problem in which I wanted to write personal journal entries, and other days post poems for critique and other days get involved in a public discussion that circled around many blogs.   So anyway I was struck with an idea? How about a place specifically built for that, where everyday a new poem was featured and the comment section which is left unused in most blogs except for randomly talking shit, could be harnessed into a productive critique. Sounds like an idea!  So here's how it works!  1. If you have a blog e-mail me so that I can give you admin access so you can post a poem.  2. If you don't have a blog you can e-mail me and I'll post if for you  3. I will not edit or censor anything  4. Posting anonymously is not only allowed but encouraged! Since for now we all know each other it might keep things simpler especially if we are not concerened with finding out people's b usiness through their poetry  5. This is new and exciting. I don't know the kinks yet but i'm anxious to find out! I'll post first!
