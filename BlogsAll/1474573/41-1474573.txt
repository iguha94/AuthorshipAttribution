WHATEVER a film shoot i was supposed to direct got cancelled and my Finals are in jeapordy now. I trooped all the way to rikers only to find out it got cancelled. People have lives and its the snow that's bad but the way the city gets shut down. The city of new york pretends that we never get snow thus using this as an excuse to not put out a cleaning crew until the whole damned place is shut down. 10 inches is not alot! but it happens every year! It's all part of the corruption in this goddamned city that is getting completely unbearable! They NEW that it was going to snow. A little bit of shoveling the first day would have at the very least cleared the main roads and some maintenance would have kept it that way. I used to live outside of buffalo y'all. THIS kind of snow aint' shit . It would snow like this for days and days but the roads were clean. THere would be a foot of ssnow on the sidewalks but the roads were clean.  The city saves a bunch of money by waiting till all the snow falls, because they don't want to pay the city workers the over time required to clean the streets. THIS after they increase fare hikes! bastards!      I said before that they NEW it would be this bad and could have prepared, but then again they knew about 911 too, what did they do about that? case and point  d roy
