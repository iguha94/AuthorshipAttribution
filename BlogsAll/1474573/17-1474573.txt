Why is it that when you sit around waiting for a call it never comes, but the second you leave the room, go out, or whatever that's when it comes it? It's like watching a pot on the stove....it will NEVER boil..... the second that you decide to walk ...the bus shows up just as you walked far enough away  from the busstop to NOT be able to run back...it's just Murphy and her goddamn laws fucking with me again. It's also when you decide to get over someone and leave and that's when their ready.......I try to take advice from great relationships before me.......Sting (and his wife), the Huxtables(fictional but who cares), Goldie Hawn and KurtRussel, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, Guy and Salome? (Ok so maybe it WAS me goi ng through the archives) I guess you may not know how great it is until 20 years later when your dick stops working and your boobs....well we won't talk about that. .....Anyway....patience is a virtue.  On to other things, last nite was the survivor slam. I won. Some liked. Lot's hated. 'nuff said. I do me and I'll continue doing me. I dare anyone to stop me with small minds and bad karma.

Be careful how you choose to express your opinion.    it's NEVER the right time to fight authority....but that's what makes it so fun :)
