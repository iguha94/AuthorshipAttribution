It's 3:08 am.....do you know where you got your last mojito?  Sadly enough, I'm more lucid drunk. I'm not saying that I'm coordinated, just more aware. (if that makes any sense at all.) This won't be a long entry, not even a really accurate account of tonights shennanigans but I'm sure it will be at the very least entertaining.    5 mojitos later on an empty stomache   I realize that when it comes down to a choice between food and alchohol, I often choose the latter. I also realized that I have a nasty habit of writing question marks when I mean periods.Why? Maybe it's my nature to question and question again or maybe it's because I don't edit enough or maybe it's Because I'm a friggin alcholic!  Spaghetti's warming up on the stove and I'm trying to stay honest and remember everything that matters   Epileptic Epiphanies   1. Mahenna movement , jessica and nina rocked at blue stockings. The waves of joy that passed over me, watching women rock the mic and rock it hard made me almost ignore the pervs that could only stare at their asses. It reminded me of my first slam, the waves of inspiration , glee and feelings of newness and possibility, something I haven't felt in a long time and I was surrounded by friends, most good, some well...........that's a whole other thesis  2. Memorable Quote  "And I got beat by the one legged guy in the wheel chair"  -Guy le charles Gonzalez  3.After a trek all OVER Loisada with the biggest group of sorta -ricans since the the Latin Image awards, we finally made it to this bar on 8th and C that served 5 dollar mojitos and played crazy salsa, merengue, mambo and ended with some pop favs. I managed to get hit on by the worlds corniest lines and hang out with the coolest folks without ONE bad incident (public)  4. That dancing accident was totally not my fault! That's what happens when you try to teach white folks how to dance  5.It's now 3:15....can you remember how many mojitos/caprinhas you had?  6. Guy is crazy, to let me co host  louder than words  with him, or rather read this as my thanks/defense mechanism that is kicking in through my surprise at someone actually valuing my opinion. (An avid conspiracy theorist and junior malcontent can only take so much) But still be there Marx 27th? and April what? Check guys blog at www.loudpoet.blogspot.com. It's late, i'm hungry and drunk, dont' ask me to remember dates or go out on them. I don't like you. go away.  7. Community Word is kicking my ASS!   Michele kotler  is a lovely woman but she's a slave driver (and sorta technically my boss) but if someone can change the world by sheer force of will she can. We have our Benefit this Sunday, I might need a date which means you can go in for 25 bucks  (donation) as opposed to a hundred. Knowing how broke ALL you fools are there's a 99% chance I'm taking my dad.  Guest Readers will be Edie Falco and Michael Imperioli from the Sopranos! oh and Mo Rocca from the Daily sHow? I don't watch that but i do watch I love the 80's and he's great!   8. I'll be the first to say that Eliel kicks ASS on the dance floor. He definately taught me mercy on the battle field  9. Cheesiest Pick up line :  "Sweetie, you are an African Princess. Are you puerto rican?"   10. There is an infomercial for ladders on. There is a very large man climbing this ladder. He is showing how strong this ladder is by not breaking it. I wonder;what was the job description for this?     Fat man needed to climb up and down ladder. Must weigh at least 400 lbs. Must not be afraid of heights or falling on your face in front of a couple of hundred people. Must be willing to travel to malls in middle America. Acting experience a plus   11.  Reason #34  that I don't mess with asian people.        After about 50 years of being at war with the French and the U.S. AND Britain the vietnam built tunnel cities in Vietcong and after massive carpet bombing the U.S. had to pull out. These are NOT people you fuck with! Shit what about the chinese? There's like a kagillion of them or Korea? Bush, you think you got balls? I dare you to bomb THEM.........jackass. Go ahead , bomb a desert full of starving quadraplegic children. Show us how manly you are....this is too pissed off for this late...next!  12.  Spanish Lesson #41   Estoy Armada - I am armed and I now know that I will never order   Penne a la Vodka  in front of either  Eliel or Juan Diaz (PERVS!)  13. highlight of my night      Prison Gang Targets Martha   but Yo. I feel bad for Martha. I don't care how much of a corporate,sleazy, selfish, conniving bitch she was because most corporate men are that way and they NEVER get villified the way she does. People are getting off on her misery. Calm yourselves.   13 Nights like these were made for private journal entries and poems. hope all is well   "Champagne for my real friends" "Real pain for my sham friends"  Good nite
