         (edit/rewrite) Imagine your alarm clock a symphony Heralding tommorrow’s Where you don’t wake up wondering If this is an up day or a down day Without the justification Of nightmares you can’t remember The ones that leave no details Simply a pain in your belly  Don’t get out of bed Until you’ve decided what you will eat Because icecream in the morning Never fails to heal And cigarettes before breakfast Never fail to remind you How bad it can get  And the floor seems so far now Craving bottom Like peace Pangs of lonely hit you in intervals Steady as a flatline  And the bustle of crowds Gets under your skin And you get mad anytime  Someone asks you for anything   the sun has changed colors 6 times already and your mood has changed 9 your body your sweat your fears aren’t yours anymore and feelings are chemical composits  Don’t look at your alarm clock You feel guilty when you do. You had a good nights sleep It’s 2 pm and life isn’t a good enough Reason to get out of bed   your pillows sound like Barry White lulling you back to them at 3pm  Hug them  feel warm And perfect  The grooves in your ceiling Have become constellations.  You can keep track of your movement In how many times you need to Roll over  in your bed  to Answer the phone Grab a book  Right now is the reason You got the wireless keyboard and mouse set   A rested mind Is borne out of relinquished hope  Counting hours like days  Measuring success in failed  Suicide attempts   Ignore the  Hum of the t.v. And aspire to be too proud To pick up a phone  Remind yourself that hard work Is happening    Crave hugs like methadone  And then Relapse  Into tears And fear Beg  for laughing prescriptions   Get through The next second The next minute  each day gets easier And asking for help is a step back  You laugh at silly questions like…  What did you do today?  I saved my life….  And  this as busy as it  gets                   </post>
