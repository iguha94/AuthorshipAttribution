Hi, I can't stay long. I have to go to class. Yes, I actually have those?  For once I actually I have my homework in  on time and I'm going to be spending this spring break catching up on TONS of work before I start teaching again at Rikers but onto FUN stuff!  I just re-edited Fight like a girl, arguably one of my best scoring and least inspiring pieces, but guess what? I like it! why? because of my not so secret fantasies of being cool enough to be a rapper. Sure I got the rhymes but I certainly don't  have the swagger/flow and this poem is totally me play acting  What's that? but the sound of the speedbag speeding up to match the pitch of my heartbeat this is the sound of sneakers hitting  concrete   Oh yeah Raquim and his 7 MC Theory, thanks Mike for the late nite flow talks , they helped and MUCH MUCH props to my resident TJ who stayed up last nite helping me with my rythm (I apparently have none)  So yup. I 'm slamming at the nuyo 2nite against Morris Stegasarus? He's the only one that I know is slamming for sure, that will be cool. I'm not expecting to win, but I do want to have fun and if my friends are there that will most certainly happen  So BE THERE or be SQUARE  and of course there will be either french roast or that salsa place after the show....so let's go!
