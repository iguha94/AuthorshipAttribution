1. Does the asshole ever write the poem?  (in response to a conversation about how poets always place themselves in the role of victim)  2.I just saw SuperSize Me....... Now mind you my mother was/IS a militant vegan in the sense that I got  beat when I was caught with kitkats in my pocket (and you WONDER why my ass needs therapy). I got forcefed "Diet for A New America" my mom was friends with John Robbins and she lived on the fringe of radical food politics..... and I hated it. I never had a choice in the matter so when I got older and moved to buffalo one of the million ways I chose to piss off my mom was through bad eating...(a whole other post) bottom line, it's really hard to gross me out and if you have the nerve to tell me what to eat I will ream you another asshole....I've spent my whole life dealing with my self image in the wake of an obssessive person who tried to force something good for me  down my throat in a bad way. This said... I never want to eat at McDonalds again and I've decided to make diligent effort to cut SHIT out of my diet. PERIOD. Ideally I'd want to be a raw foodist (nothing cooked) How easy will that be? not very? Food is a drug and I'm addicted, how am I going to do this? I don't know but watching this guy and what he went through especially the physiolgical and psychological strain food put him through gave me several epiphanies... I'll keep those to myself... but yeah...go see it. It was McGood...
