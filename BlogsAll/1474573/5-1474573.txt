A lot of people seem to be confused about my "agenda" for  louder than words .  Some think it's purely about the opportunity to mess with people I think are blowhards.  Others think it's about pushing a political ideology.  I'm sure there's a few whispering that it's pure vanity.  Earlier today, in a continuation of the discussion I posted an excerpt from yesterday in   my own journal , I expressed it like this: The show is intended to look under the mask so many poets wear when they're on stage and get a glimpse of what they're really about. How their minds work. What they stand for beyond the clever metaphors and hook lines. It's like intellectual improv.  Bob's spin on it, which Taylor seems to agree with, is one of the more thoughtful and interesting of the bunch:  "this show is the first true critique of the new po, slam/spoken/perfed, done in the only way it can be: LIVE & in yr FACE."   While more limited in scope than Eric and I initially thought, I'm starting to think he's nailed it. And hey, he  is  the guy that recognized the potential of slam and brought it to NYC where it blew up so who am I to argue with THAT?  ;-)  In other news, check out the previous entry's comments section for an interesting debate that's brewing about "the definition of poetry."  Good stuff!  Jump on in.  See you tomorrow night!
