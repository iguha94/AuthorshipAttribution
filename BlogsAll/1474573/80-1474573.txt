I'm more tired and cranky that I can mouth. I know that this is just a general/generic complaint, in fact you're probably asking yourself with the amount of time that I spend blogging when and where do I even have time to go to school.   This semester wasn't supposed to be as hard as it is. Maybe it's not the semester, maybe it's just me.  Running on this kind of adrenaline with no break hasn't been good for me. I've been doing it since 9/11.  At first it was just a hard semester, each following one, I'd say to myself,  "Diane if you can get through this then it gets easier"  it doesnt.  At first it was just a hard semester, then it's become something more of a habit, an addiction.   The bags and dark circles under my eyes are not attractive, I know this. I've had the same tired smile on for some years now. Maybe I just bury my depression in my work, but no......that would be way to easy.  It's the other way around. As much as I hate academia (or more specifically academics), like any writer my self worth is based on what I produce, thus the more work I produce the better I am right? This idea goes out the window when you've produced not one SINGULARLY ORIGINAL IDEA!  I stopped  trying  to be happy a long time ago. "I'm better then that" I thought. I wanted to be something more important, something more tangible, something that lasted longer and affected more people. I wanted something that trivialized the emptiness in my heart..........  now i sit , amidst a thesis that my never get written, poems that make me puke, unfinished short stories.....I spilled coffee on them... and I don't care  My fone is running out of charge   "This city's made us crazy and we must get out"  -Maroon 5
