         When I come over The first thing I do  Is walk to your medicine cabinet Count the condoms and  See if my toothbrush is still there and it is  with a confidence that pounds inside you Steady and slow As if speaking  Pushing at my whims Bleeding through my seams it ignores angry 1am hang-ups noontime blowouts as I pray to gods of either/or that admonish me for loving you  grey and unannounced with a desperation that hangs thick in midnight phone calls  "hey" "……..hey" "where are you?" "around the corner"   ……this keeps me going  your phone number something I’ve memorized because of the amount of times I’ve deleted it  our relationship pocket Aces and a shitty flop  bet anyway it’s worth chasing  measure our strengths in increments of failed suicides gasping at arms and thighs like air  Like clockwork the aftermath sings a morse code of secret winks and missed glances  the space between us so palatable  that gossipers choke on their assumptions  memorizing the rhythm of a tango that won’t end until we are both dead so....  I’ve invested in the  Twenty pack of toothbrushes    One for every time I’m too sick to stand too weak to leave too tired to stay too dirty and plain too impatient haggard hopeless confused content  and coming    So that when forgiveness Becomes futile And your thumbs are raw From digging under my skin  Don’t stop ……………I like you there
