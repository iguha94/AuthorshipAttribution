" Looks like you've got a case of the monday's?"   Say that to me at 8AM and watch how quickly I will knock you out. I've learned two things from my years of experience in corporate America 1) you must seriously watch your caloric intake when you are sitting in front of a computer 7 hours a day 2) The sound of you typing feverishly away doesn't always make you look busy. It just sounds like you're on Aol Instant Messenger and THAt's the reason whyyou know how to type 90 wpm.  Anyway...now that i've been thorougly reprimanded for not updating my blog I now realize that I have a distinct responsibility not only as an avid blog user but also as a writer/historian/poet/ (sometimes public) intellectual. what does that mean? I've got to sound interesting and at least pretend when I'm not .  It's cheaper then getting therapy and paying somone to listen to my b.s.  So.... I'm slamming tonight at 13. Have a I prepared? Don't ask me that. It's my first time slamming in a while and if you're not doing it for a while of course you get nervous. Once it starts I'll be ok, but i'm doing pieces I've never slammed before so.....oh well... On the open mic you don't care what folks think and for the most part I don't care what people think period... but for me the scores help me get a better understanding of whether or not poeple  GET the piece. If you got it and you just straight up didn't like it......give me a low score... I can deal with that ...if you really liked it ....give me a high score...but it's the in between scores that annoy me....they are the..."I'm sure you said something really deep but I don't really know what it was score" That means that I have to go back to the drawing board and rework.  Fish talked about "true poetry?" ...uhh there's no such thing. I've got one word to disprove that...: SHAPPY. Case closed.  Poetry ...or at least spoken word is/should be about communication with the audience. You could be saying the dopest shit...if theydon't get it though...then what's the point? Publish a chapbook, so someone can read it /analyze it over and over again. Communication is a two part process. It's not just about talking....it's about taking the time out to make sure that your message got delivered in the way you intended it. What happens after that is up to the audience member/listener. It's like that in love and relationships i'm learning.......saying stuff isn't enough....actions/verbs speak volumes louder ....when emotions are involved whether in friendships or romantic relationships...they tend to blur the ear. Take for example a situation a friend of mine is in. He's been trying to break up with the same girl for a while...she just aint' listenin....I told him that he can't lead her on.  If he cares about her, it's HIS responsibility to make sure that she gets the message.   Anyway enough ranting about that.....my variation on a theme....here goes  Sexual things that befuddle me..........  Why don't white people wash their hands in the bathroom? When you are with your girl, she goes down on you, you finish, then you kiss her.  Why?  (uhh, fish you should have been with enough catholic girls to know that a girl needs reassurance that you don't think she's dirty for doing that...Guys are funny that way)   Why is bi-sexuality in women more accepted then in men?  I don't think it is...guys have that fantasy that two women really want to be  with THEM but that they just foray in lesbianis.....ummm...in reality it's not so cool for alot guys...competition is competition...now that have twice as many people too worry about their girl cheating on them with. And I personally never had an issue with bi-men...it's just that few men in general are bi.....  Why is there dialogue in porn? (for guys who watch with their girlfriends)   Why are women more visually enticed by a flaccid 9 inch penis that gains half an inch when hard but not with a 6 inch flaccid penis that gains 4 inches when hard?  Personally I'm impressed by a 4 inch tongue   Why do fat guys have small penis? Not that mines is small!!!!!! LOL   I do n't know    Religious things that befuddle me   Why are born again christian boys so attracted to ME?        Boyfriend Questions that befuddle me   Is it always really about the chase? If men don't actually emotionally mature till they're 40   hmm..I thought I had some more but I think I'm less confused than I thought..... Film at 11
