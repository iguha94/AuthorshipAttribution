I figured this was long enough to qualify as a post. It was a response to Guy's rant on guns if anyone cares to join the discussion.  I'm feeling you on the gun thing.....being a (not so young anymore) woman living on her own in brooklyn, I seriously contemplated getting a piece. After 6 months of living in my apartment the whole neighborhood new that A) I was single no matter how many times that I told the guy at the bodega that i was married to a very big man and 2) that i was young ( Ilooked it) and that i went to school ( I had the same schedule every day). This was good in the sense that there WAS a sense of community to some extent ....but being in my position anyone could get that info and THAT made me a target. Think I'm paranoid? a year later when i did a feature at Rikers , this guy kept telling me i looked familiar....thinking that it was some obscure porn reference i ignored him, then he says "Now i know where i know you, you lived in Floyd Patterson's building. I saw you walk to and from school everyday." Mind you he was doing a 1.5 yr  bid for smoking weed on his front porch and i recognized him as part of the group of guys that did, thing is we never spoke and that "community" could have easily become something else. His crew on the corner of my block was one of at least 6 crews on six different stoops that i passed on my way to the train  everyday......Young girls alone are targets as are old women, the elderly in general anything......It IS a jungle sometimes and especially when we have para military nazis......i mean cops out there ready to shoot first rather then serve and protect it feels kinda scary and you feel powerless to defend yourself.....from ANYbody...
