I wake up earlier these days.....around 6:30 and not some hypo-maniacal 4:30 get three hours of sleep type thing..... Now that I'm not spending my extra time and money  out, I'm doing what I've been wanting to focus on....my writing... in a general sense, not neccessarily poetry  either. It's amazing what sleeping can do for your general tempepermant Oh don't worry I've still got my issues!   1. I took my Atmosphere CD out of my drawer and I don't  want to listen to it, afraid of indulging in my dark fantasies   2. Worked out for the first time in months. It's been hard to find a regular routine, with all the moving, the injury, the changes. Today is Thursday, day four of normal living again. I haven't had this much space in, well I can't remember....  This workout is the pre-workout for before I start back up in the gym again. Seeing how badly out of shape I've gotten my sifu will punish me. I hope he doesn't kill me. I was never really into stair climbing and treadmills..... I've always needed something more interesting, like boxing. It works everything and it really pushes your limits emotionally and phsyically.   I'm a survivor, I'm not g'on give up    Lactic acid is the electric guitar to the symphony of rhythms raging rope beating linolieum heart crushing against a ribcage straining past a shirt that was too small two years go  tears and sweat sprinkled over clenched teeth seasoning taught lips with the taste of last nights ravioli  Think only in  calories and kilojules speak only in the language of BMI ....    whatever I'm not finishing this one        .
