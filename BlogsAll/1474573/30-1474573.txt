I'm taking an advanced poetry class with none other then Sekou Sundiata. It's kind of weird for me because evidently we're going to be studying alot of "performance" poetry in class. It's weird because of where I am in the contradiction between student and artist. I say contradiction because the chasm between "academic poetry" and what I pay 5 bucks to listen to at nuyo/13/bowery was/is large. I don't/didn't know where I fit. On one hand, I started writing because of the influence I had from poets like Alix olson, Rog, guy, lynne, stacey ann ....on the other hand the practice of studying and furthermore objectiving living artists is (for lack of a better term) kinda weird. Especially when you drink with them, hang out etc..For example, I'm supposed to do a write up of The United States of Poetry (produced by bobby holman) and it was tough not inserting all of my little personal antectdotes....On the other hand I welcome it as a wonderful oppurtunity. I guess the weirdness comes from my lambasting of slam while i'm in the scene but how much i defend it's democratic nature while i'm in class: exiled at both ends of the string. Most social critics are critics because they don't do the art. They don't write, make movies etc...they are far removed from the process thus most times being less sympathic in their critique only concerned  with the outcome. Just something to think about. Anyway, there's this exercise (which y'all should try) which invovles reading your poem backwards and seeing what you get. Simple, but effective. Because I've been writing in the 3 minute time frame for so long, I've felt stuck in it, conciously and sub conciously writing 3 minute pieces (though ironically I aparently have NO RESPECT for the dreaded time penalty). So in celebration of my blog being back up, getting back into poetry and a newfound dedication to artistic rigor here's a brand new non-slam piece. The title comes from the childrens' sci-fi book    A wrinkle in Time .  A tesseract is basically a cube squared. In the context of the back, a tesseract also allows you to bend time and space. It allows you to travel from here to wherever by making a "wrinkle in time".     Tesseract    cake super chocolate triple layered piece of double fudge  a shower in the rain before the cognizance of thunder  3rd dimension beings living on a 4th dimension planet visiting the 5th is luxury  what if a trip to the moon  cost $1.50  what if space was a minor detail  what if time  made the comma the semi colon the period antiquated after the climb                                            (do...mi...sol...) into the perfect the fifth  there would be no distance to make the heart grow fonder only  you
