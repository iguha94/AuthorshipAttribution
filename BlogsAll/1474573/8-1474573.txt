         Doomsday is near as soon as the politicians go honest. Bad thoughts are more dangerous than Wards, dungeons, and prisons. While most of you sleep,  I lie awake and yawn. My thoughts about the subtle flecks  Of emerald green in her sea blue eyes Casually drifted away towards clarity.  My quagmire of a life resembles A wretched Fox sitcom, A Shakespeare play,  A black and white Woody Allen film. Except that Joey Buttafucco is the lead actor And stands forty-five pounds overweight.  My unspoken silence is a sullen, dangerous,  Listless lunacy that used to turn women on, Those who where attracted to the  Orgasmic gentleness of crafty madness. Cunning souls can be as scintillating as a slice of Junior's cheesecake when digested with a  Side plate of untamed confusion.  Respect the scorns of time and Rebuke the erroneous laws of nature, then Perhaps my quiet dismay will disappear to A titillating place where no traveler returns. I mock the lost ones, Cowards of them all. Clueless ampersands as they stand on a crowded Subway platform in between two genuine haughty artisans.  I've sweat heavily in my weary life, Reflections of my ghostly inaction set against a Riveted backdrop of flames and plumes of smoke. Without a tongue, I speak with a bedeviled spirit Ignoring the weakness that I could cure with a Drop of arsenic, Indeed, a foul murder just mere moments Away from ambitious persons who dare to be more than Blips on the radar screen.
