So I called..........  out of curiousity, out of loneliness, wondering if we lived out the dreams we set out when we were 15. I called his old number and his mom answered. She's a really nice woman. We had yet another 15 minute converstation then she told me that he had his own place in Harlem and gave me the number there. Some guy answered and I immediately thougth maybe I had the wrong number but asked for him anyway   Hey.....  hi?....  Umm....this is diane...from highschool?

He mentioned something about having coffee..........I said.....notice it's been X years and we still haven't met?  he laughed....
