I was in the middle of  writing a post-chappelle  frapper de retour ..............and then I got over it. Apologies to those interested in the convervsation but it was getting older by the minute, feel free to continue it on my tagboard or comments section.Provacative discussion is always a welcome sight here. The conversation became a  variation on an already tired theme and by the time I actually got to my response ,  the conversation had long moved on.    moving on.........    1. I just got up from finally finishing  Flowers for Algernon , only to realize that this was the most reading that  I'd done in a long time. It was the first time in a very long time that I'd been entrapped by a book. The book was great, insightful, sad, heartwarming and ...........sadly very close to home.  Or perhaps it's just my tendency to make everything relate.  It wasn't the book so much as the act of reading that made me realize how far gone I've been, how little time I'd given to myself and most importantly how out of touch I've been with my own humanity. Even though, I'm a writer I'm finding it incredibly difficult to express myself for fear of the repercussions of that honesty.    2. "Where'd you get those issues? That's Life"                   -Slug I've got a huge chip on my shoulder and it informs the way I view things, not out of  some paranoia that's come out of no where but out of an experience in which all those rules do/did apply. Sometimes those rules don't apply but it doesn't mean that they are there without reason.  I'm being cryptic, I know hence the lack of blogging. I'm going to stop now  *Written April 28th
