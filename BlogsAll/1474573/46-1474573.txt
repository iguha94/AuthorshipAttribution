Ok, so I shot my movie. Not the way I wanted to , but it's shot. I'm going to see what I've got and ask for an extension and just take what I can get. Anyone who knows that.... I'll be in this computer lab all nite..... you SHALL be updated... ..oooh oooh! Lauryn's on..."Forgive them Father"  The eX-FILES  Who watches "sex in the city?" raise your hand...you know of what i speak. I've got it, a Mr. Big, that one elusive one that got away, the equation that will never solve itself, the insecurity that will rear it's ugly head on wedding days and honeymoon nights...  I'm simply resigned the fact that our lives will forever be linked, we'll always find a way back to each other. I'm sure i could move to Cali or down South, start a new life, come back years later only to find at the two of us, alone in a room together = heat hotter the magma..... I suppose somethings are biochemical, they have to be. You KNOW when you've gotten over someone. You don't think about them and moreover you don't think about not thinking about them, that's why it's even more surprising when these pangs hit you when you see them again. "Old reactions to an old feeling"  I think not.....what if all it takes is their presence? I've dated and dated and there's a process.....sooner or later it gets tired, it gets stale, kisses lose their sizzle and then you get tired and you get out. But what if the sizzle will never go out? What if you are flint and I'm pressure? Together we'll always make sparks. My friend has one of these.....she calls him "Crack" because some people are addictions. You see the havoc they wreak on your life but you still can never let go. This is why alchoholics don't simply slow down their drinking, they have to stop completely. Like cigarrettes, I'll quit him, as I always do, months at a time, sometimes years....... but i know that the air will never get thinner thick with lust and longing and I'll hold my breathe as long as i can but eventually i know  i'll breathe
