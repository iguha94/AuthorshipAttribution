         It was beautiful out today. Well, it was a little cloudy when I came to work, but before that it was a perfect January day. It's been awhile since I talked about the weather. Come to think of it, it's been awhile since I talked to Ryan.  When I went to the post office today 17 people were in line in front of me. And about 30 seconds later, six more were behind me. You would have thought it was Christmastime again or April 14. But no, it was about 1:30 p.m. on Jan. 14.  And I bought a calendar today for $3 - totally the advantage of waiting until mid-January to buy it. The Absolut bottle decorated as a Christmas tree on my 2001 calendar was getting old, so I decided it was time to buy a current one. Sure, the selection was limited, but the price was so right. I looked at two different stores, and who would have thought so many dog calendars even existed? Well, I did buy Mark a Saluki calendar for one of his secret Santa presents at work, but that was a totally personalized gift for the Southern Illinois grad. Plus he knows how ugly I think they are and I know how great he thinks they are. Anyway, way too many dog calendars are still for sale. The one I bought has these great pictures of people in love, well, all different kinds of love - an old couple in love at the laundromat, a young couple who just got married on the beach, family and friendship love.    Laura  posted some adorable pictures of her niece and nephew.
