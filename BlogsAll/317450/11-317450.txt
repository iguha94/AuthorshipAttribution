         ok, tonight is totally a lower-case kind of night. mellow. content.  but not overly excited, and definitely not too dramatic.  well, here it is, the end of the much-anticipated saturday off work. did it live up to its expectations, considering it is a rare occasion in my life? no. but it did have its redeeming moments: eating and laughing with robinson, watching "drive me crazy" on a rainy afternoon while sitting in my comfy recliner, laughing with ryan and his brothers, beating ryan in scrabble by one point, receiving a true long-distant phone call from greg (usually we talk on my cell phone after 8 p.m. and on weekends so it doesn't use my minutes) and talking to cara on the phone three times.   i love my friends.  i wish the friends i hung out with this week lived closer. dinner with matt was fun, and normal, which was much-appreciated. ryan always makes me laugh. i'm sure living in colorado is good for kelly, but i sure miss her here. playing games with her family is hilarious. taboo wednesday made me laugh a lot. (i once had a professor that said "a lot" is a field, not a large amount of something. guess i just misused that. and i'm anal enough to recognize that, but not so anal i'm going to back to change it.) katie peter and matt are going to be back in louisville in december, though, so hopefully i'll get to hang out with them more often.   i love laughing.  my last entry i commented on my anticipation of two hours of CSI. well, it wasn't a two-hour episode. it was two one-hour episodes, which would have been good, but the second one was a rerun. how disappointing. my other disappointment: i didn't get to go bowling today. maybe greg will go with me tomorrow. but you know, if those are the two biggest disappointments in my week, my life is good. and i am thankful for it. nope, not just because it's the holiday season. just because God is good.
