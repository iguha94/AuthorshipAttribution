         Crazy but good day... First, I got up this morning and wondered just for a second why my alarm was going off at 8 a.m. Then I remembered I was going to the Titans game with Greg, some of his family and two of his friends. OK, good enough, I got out of bed. When I got in the shower, I looked out the window (Yes, my shower has a window in it, but it blurred at the bottom so nobody can see in. But the top is clear.) and saw snow on the ground. Then I asked myself again what I was doing: going to a football in the snow? Well, turns out the snow only went a little passed E-town.   The game... My first NFL game was fun, even though it rained through most of the first quarter.  Then everything was going fine, we ate at Cracker Barrel when we got back to E-town. But when Greg dropped me off at my car, it wouldn't start. To make a long story short (Yeah, can you believe Kristin is making a long story short?!), AAA came and jump started my car, even though I thought it was the starter and not the battery. Guess I was wrong. I ended up having to pay about $20 for the jump start because my mom hadn't paid the AAA bill for the new year yet. Oh well, everything worked out, now I'm warm and cozy in my apartment.
