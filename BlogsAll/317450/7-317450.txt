         A productive Saturday: I ate lunch with Shelley and Dustin -- my  married  friends. Then my mom and I made two blue sheets into curtains and a valace. The curtains are up, and the valace is ready. I just need one more curtain rod.  Speaking of being domestic, I got a new green cover and green and blue pillows for my couch. It looks better and is more comfortable. But for those of you who liked the worn-out flowers, have no fear, the cover isn't quite big enough and doesn't cover the arms very well. So, the flowers aren't completely buried.  Anyway, back to today. Tonight I haven't done much at work. No, I am a hard worker. Saturdays are just slow. Don't ask how the news slows down on the weekends. That's a concept I haven't grasped yet. Well, it does make sense if you think about all the people not working, but doing other things with their live. Anyway, Lori and I went to eat at Los Aztecas. Great Mexican food! And it was good to hang out with Lori.  Lori is my friend at work who also went to Murray. This past week we haven't worked together -- different days and shifts. That means no trips outside for her smoke breaks, which also serve as much-appreciated time from useless stress in the office. We worked together at the newspaper at school, but didn't know each other that well. Now we talk about our lives, TV shows and work.  Now I'm playing scrabble online with Ryan. And Greg is coming into town when I get off work. It's been a good day.
