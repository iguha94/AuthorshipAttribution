         it's been a good birthday, considering i am at work. greg came in last night and we watched "survivor" and "CSI." this morning he took me to breakfast at denny's. i had a waffle with strawberries on it. yum, yum. and he brought me a new book to read and a super nintendo. i love tetris on super nintendo because it's a two-player game and i get awfully competitive. greg couldn't find the right game, but he's working on that part. then i'll have to arrange a time to take on adam, who was the best tetris player i knew at one point. today at work, cara came and took me to lunch at the cafe across the street. she gave me a fun present - some of my favorite mexican gum, a magnetic quote and a neat mug thing that has a cara-decorated thing inside. that doesn't make sense? it's this mug that has a place around the outside in between two layers of plastic, the outer one clear, to put a personalized-decorated paper thing. ok, that's enough of my attempt to explain that. mrs. quigley called and sang happy birthday on my voice mail. and jeff gave me a plant, a pretty plant. hopefully i won't kill it. tonight i'm going out with lori and kelly, and maybe some other people.   "there is no use trying," said alice; "one can't believe impossible things." "i dare say you haven't had much practice," said the queen. "when i was your age, i always did it for half an hour a day. why, sometimes i've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."  -lewis carroll  (that's the magnetic quote cara gave me.)
