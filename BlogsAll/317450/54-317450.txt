         here's my latest accomplishments: got a comfy new queen-size mattress (it's in lexington thanks to cara and kelly.), put blinds up on the kitchen patio door (thanks to greg), addressed and stuff about 150 wedding invitations (with a little help from greg), interviewed with a saddlebred horse magazine (ok, so i probably won't get the job. one, i don't know anything about horses in general, much less saddlebred horses specifically. two, august is their busiest month, and i'm getting married then.), worked on a creative present for my bridesmaids, scheduled an appointment with the reception site lady on monday, registered for china at dillards, got a new license with my new lexington address (that policewoman better be happy), paid part of speeding ticket, continued to make my apartment feel like home. see, even without a job, i've managed to be productive and fill my time rather wisely. tomorrow i'm doing a stringer assignment for the AP. hey, it's $50. and all i have to do is go to mass tomorrow morning and get some catholic reaction to whatever abuse policy the bishops vote on tonight at their conference.   last night greg and i went to see "bad company." it was funny. chris rock and anthony hopkins were a great combination. i really love living in the same city as greg. we eat dinner together most nights and get to see each other on a regular basis for the first time in two years. well, i guess once a week was a "regular basis," but now it's frequent and regular. yay!
