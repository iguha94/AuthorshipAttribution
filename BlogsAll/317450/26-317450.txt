         I made some minor changes.  AT SIXTH AND BROADWAY   While I sat in the warmth of my car,  singing along with Adam Duritz,  I thought about how blessed I am  because my laughs have always outnumbered my tears. I waited for the light to turn green as   people crossed the street,  leaving the same seven-story building  I was getting ready to enter. With the night shift, I traded my clunky black dress shoes and pants that required ironing for jeans and a pair of gray New Balance.   A minute later my glove-covered hands  were in my coat pockets with my eyes fixed  across Broadway waiting for WALK to appear in white.  As strands of hair criss-crossed my face,  I thought about my pseudo-grown-up life in this new year:  I rest comfortably in the arms of familiarity while  my mind is intrigued by 1 a.m. conversations.  Are all guys like Harry when he met Sally? Emotions run deeper, decisions reflect character  and hearts aren't playing fields.  Hearts are fragile in even the toughest men.  Peter Pan had such a good point,  but I'm learning that's truly a fairytale.  And I slipped into the revoling door  of the work that seems to have become my life.  After I've said "Associated Press, this is Kristin"  more times than I care to count  while my wrist warned me of carpel tunnel syndrome  and my contacts begged me to look away from the computer screen,  the chilly midnight air is somehow refreshing.  And instead of waiting at the crosswalk,  downtown is asleep enough for me to  look both ways and cross Broadway  somewhere between Sixth and Armory.  Why can't life be like that -  somewhere between black and white?
