         I've had a good weekend and really wish it would last another day or two. FRIDAY night we hung out at Greg's parents' house and ate some fabulous potato soup. That's after I spent the majority of my work day covering the Murray State Board of Regents meeting. SATURDAY I slept in a little but not near as long as I would have liked then was productive wrapping Christmas presents and folding laundry before we watched the UK game. Um, a win is a win, but two points is cutting it close, especially after being up 23-6 early in the first half. Last night we went to southern Illinois to the Madrigal dinner, which included a play, at Shawnee Community College. My friend Sarah has written the scripts for the plays the last several years, so Greg and I went up there with Jaclyn and Bryan. We got to see Sarah and Kelly too, which was good. We went to the Madrigal dinner several times in college, so it was fun to do it again this year after not having been there for a few years. After dinner and the play, we all hung out at Sarah's parents' house, playing the name good. Good times. TODAY we went to Nashville for the Titans game. We had a good time and the weather was fabulous. Too bad the Titans lost by two. Too bad Justin McCareins fumbled the punt return with 50 seconds left after the Titans came close to having a come-from-behind victory. I know, close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, and definitely not in football. Oh, and Murray State beat Western in double overtime in Bowling Green. That would have been a fun game to watch.
