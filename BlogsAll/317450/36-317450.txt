         i spent four and a half hours today talking to this friend of mine - jennifer partin. well, she's more like a mentor, you know. she gives great motherly advice that really encourages me to know God more. she's one of the people i turned to a lot when i first became a christian. anyway, i went to her sunday school class yesterday and it was exactly what i have been looking for. so i was planning on just going by her house today, playing catch-up because it had been awhile since we talked. but i ended up spending all the time before i came to work there. it was great. she asked me lots of questions about greg and i, the wedding and marriage. i really respect her marriage and her opinions, so it was good to share what i think about these things with her.   we were talking about the rules people unfortunately associate with being a christian, and how people get too caught up in legalism. but sometimes we are too quick to judge these people when "we are all just a thought away from being a pharisee." that's what she said. how true is that? and what a great way to put it.   i had a list of errands to run today. but it's really okay God had this other plan for my day because i think my heart needed it. you know, just a good conversation with someone who has known me since i was 17. she's one of the few people who has witnessed by spiritual growth from the beginning. and while i know i have a long way to go, she knows where i came from. one thing i really love about her is how when she talks about her relationship with God, she always uses active verbs because it's a process. that's one of the many things i have learned from her - knowing God doesn't happen over night. it's like any other relationship in the way it takes time to build.  today was a simple reminder that God is completely in control of my life, and while he lives decisions to me, i'm much better off to follow his lead.
