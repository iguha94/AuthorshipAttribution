           laura  says i don't update my blog as much since i'm married now. but really it's because my job doesn't involve as much free time as my last, so that's less time messing around on the computer. plus i have a swell new roommate, which does take up SOME of my time.   it was great to see laura this weekend. i miss our dorm room chats, but it's comforting to know God created a true friendship between us and we can always pick up where we left off. i also saw lynn and andrea, two of my college friends who live in florida. lynn lives in naples and organizes cool recreation program for kids with disabilities and andrea lives in west palm beach and works for a christian radio station. i got to hang out with jaclyn, too. God totally puts her right where i need her. it's fun that we're in the same stage of our life and can share stuff. (i know i've said that before, but those who know me well know i'm repetitive.) we hung out with greg's family too - went to the homecoming parade and ate a couiple of meals with them.  we hung out with laura and dave in their new house in la grange on sunday. i was super jealous of the house, but glad to spend some time with them. we grilled out and watched sports, perfect activities for a lazy sunday afternoon.   murray state won its homecoming game, so that made it more fun. greg and i are going to watch murray play eastern this weekend for EKU's homecoming. figure i can invest a bit into the town in which i work. too bad i'll be cheering for the visiting team.  ok, i'm going to watch the cardinals. dang giants. barry better not hit any homers.
