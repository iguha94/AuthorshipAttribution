         So Milla is the cutest baby ever. She has beautiful skin, long fingers and toes, pretty blue eyes and the most precious lips and nose. She likes to touch her face a lot and kept sleeping with her hands near her eyes. Kevin is adorable with her; she's going to be a daddy's girl for sure. I hate that I don't get to see her for three weeks.   I got to see Cara and her Mexico pictures yesterday while we ate lunch at Panera Bread. I also talked to KatieKerns on the phone on the way back to Murray. Both were much-needed conversations to sort of refresh me. I was in a blah mood last week and needed a boost to my spirit. My friends and new niece sure did the trick.   Here are some good quotes Lori forwarded me today: "If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day, so I never have to live without you." -- Winnie the Pooh  "Don't walk in front of me, I may not follow. Don't walk behind me, I may not lead.. Walk beside me and be my friend." -- Albert Camus  "Strangers are just friends waiting to happen." -- Anonymous  "I'll lean on you and you lean on me and we'll be okay." -- Dave Matthews  "We all take different paths in life, but no matter where we go, we take a little of each other everywhere." -- Tim McGraw  Another e-mail forward:  THINGS THAT IT TOOK ME OVER 48 YEARS TO LEARN        by Dave Barry  If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be "meetings."  You should not confuse your career with your life.   Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance.   Never lick a steak knife.   The most destructive force in the universe is gossip.  You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and compelling reason why we observe daylight savings time.   You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests that you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her at that moment.  The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender, religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, we ALL believe that we are above average drivers.   A person, who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice person. (This is very important. Pay attention. It never fails.)   Your friends love you anyway.   Never be afraid to try something new. Remember that a lone amateur built the Ark. A large group of professionals built the Titanic.   Men are like a fine wine. They start out as grapes, and it's up to women to stomp the crap out of them until they turn into something acceptable to have dinner with.
