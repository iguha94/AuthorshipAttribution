         This weekend was good.  FRIDAY  I went to a laser show at the planetarium with Kelly and some others. It was pretty neat. The show we saw was set to Led Zepplin music, which was OK, but I want to go back to the other ones - pop  music and U2. Also, the skies of Louisville show sounds pretty neat.  SATURDAY  my sister went to prom so I got to see her all dressed up. She looked beautiful. I also took my mom her mother's day present because I was out of town on Sunday. I ran a bunch of errands and got things ready for Jaclyn's bridal shower. That night I went to my old boss' retirement dinner, which was at this club on UofL's campus. It was nice and a fun time to hang out with my now-former co-workers. Then I went my Sarah's apartment for a little get together she was having. Kent's leaving this week for the Air Force, so it was good to see him.  SUNDAY  Greg, Kelly and I drove to Murray for the day. We ate lunch at Greg's parents' house, then Kelly and I went to Jaclyn's for the shower we were throwing for her. It turned out well. It was great, as always, to see Jaclyn.   I wrote a story about King Alexander that moved on the wire for this weekend. I've already found it in four newspapers - not bad for someone who no longer has to go through that massive stack of newspapers at work. The Murray and Madisonville papers ran it on their front pages. Owensboro ran it inside Sunday. And   The Courier-Journal  used it today. That's an encouraging way to go out.  Today Kelly is going with me to two flower shops. And I'm trying to touch base with some people who have my resume.
