         Ryan says he worries about me. But I don't know why. I think it bugs him when I am abstract and vague. He likes specifics. Funny, though, because usually I'm a very detailed-oriented person.   Anyway, so this update is especially for Ryan. But you know, I really don't think anyone else reads this, so it doesn't matter if I direct it to Ryan or not. Well, Laura reads it, too, I think. Maybe people could   email  me if they read this and I don't know about it.  Work has been going well. I still am trying to learn the AP system. Like a co-worker said, "Learning the system is here is like learning Greek." The program itself is much like Word, so that doesn't complicate my life. But the codes and organization of how stories are stored is sort of confusing. Plus there are multiple wires a story could move on -- sports, state, national, political, south. I'm getting it down, and I have figured out who are my best co-workers to ask questions.   I've consumed myself with a book lately, which is something I haven't done in awhile. Most of the four-hour drive from Lexington to Murray this weekend, I read while Greg drove. Of course, I talked to him, too. Anyway, it's one of those courtroom dramas that has twists in it -- both related to the case and to those involved personal lives. I like situations like that. They make me think, I guess. That's why I like "CSI," too. That show is great. My tastes are diverse -- from "CSI" to "Dawson's Creek." Oh, well.   See, I'm just babbling. This will probably make Ryan happy.   But, anyway, I got the second book by the same author -- who is actually a trial lawyer, too -- yesterday at the Louisville Free Public Library. I went to the downtown branch because it is only a few blocks from my work. The building is really neat, inside and out. And I think it is funny the word "free" is in the name. The idea of libraries being free is pretty much what makes them what they are in my mind.
