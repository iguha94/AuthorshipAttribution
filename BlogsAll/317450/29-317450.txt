         lori and i went to the UK game today, thanks to some of the bureau's season tickets that "have been floating around," according to a co-worker. we had a great time, though. it makes it even better than it was spontaneous. i got the tickets during my shift last night and the game was before my shift today. worked out well, actually. during one of the second half media timeouts, the cheerleaders started this C-A-T-S cheer where each of the four sections (two ends and two sides) yelled one of the four letters, you know, sort of like the wave. anyway (wonder how many times a day i say "anyway"?), the cheerleaders stopped, and started a new cheer, but the student section kept the C-A-T-S cheer going. they were the "C," so the rest of rupp arena followed. it went on a for a long time, through the whole timeout, and didn't stop until something dramatic happened in the game and the students decided to pay attention to the game again. well, then they randomly got it started again. it was hilarious. and the best part was that it drowned out the cheerleaders. yes, they get credit for getting it started, but that's about it. it was good to be in rupp arena when the wildcats won. they led the whole way, actually. have i mentioned how great our work season tickets are? yeah, they're great. ten rows back is pretty perfect. five would be better. ok, front row would be better. but ten rows back is better than sitting on the floor, where marquis estill can fall on you, like he did a herald-leader photographer today. he's a big guy. that couldn't have felt good. yes, i'm a geek, i pay attention to press row.
