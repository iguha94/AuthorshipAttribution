         I think this is the first time since I've been married that I've been at my parents' house without Greg. I miss Greg, but I've really enjoyed hanging out with my mom. It has been just the two of us this weekend. Yesterday we went to the eye doctor so I could get new contacts, went shopping at Kohl's and Old Navy so I could get some new pants, ate lunch with Poppy at Buckhead's, went to visit Kevin and Milla (She's beautiful.) and ate dinner later at Cracker Barrel. Then at 8 p.m. or so we both were tired but managed to watch some basketball. I bonded with Kali the cat this morning, even though she makes me sneeze. And Bailey thinks I'm her best friend now, and that's a good thing because she's coming home with me for two weeks.   Speaking of basketball, my bracket isn't looking too good, but that's OK because the upsets are fun to see. My brother told me yesterday he heard a sports commentator say Kentucky would be the first No. 1 seed to lose. All I have to say is thanks, Stanford. Who cares that I had the Cardinal (who uses a tree as a mascot anyway?) going to the final game against Kentucky. And you've got to love that an SEC team beat them.   Friday night one of the CBS guys said Rick Pitino was a genius of college basketball. Only a few minutes later did UofL start to blow its 14-point lead. My mom and I were talking because we thought Louisville was going to start to run away with the game, but then we looked at the TV and saw that Xavier was within a couple of points. It sure got more interesting then, because maybe Pitino isn't a genius. (OK, I know, if he were to come back to Kentucky we'd all love it in a heartbeat. We being Wildcat fans, that is.)
