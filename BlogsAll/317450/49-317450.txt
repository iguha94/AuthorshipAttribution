         good weekend. and i truly mean weekend, you know, my first such "normal" one since, well, since i started working at the AP. when i first started, it was football season, so i worked friday nights. then a couple of "normal" work weeks then basketball season in november. so, now it's april, and i have about a month to enjoy a 10-6 job (doesn't have the same ring as 9-5, but the hours are perfect!). actually a month or so to enjoy a job, period.  back to my weekend... played apples to apples with greg, kelly, cara, laura, dave and tim friday night. ate chumbo's pizza for the first time. pretty good. cleaned my apartment. went shopping with my mom and cassie saturday. watched "high crimes." good movie. then ironically "kiss the girls" was on tv. funny, two ashley judd-morgan freeman movies in one night. but we only watched part of the latter. went to church today. hung out with greg here. good lazy time. in fact, i took two brief naps. threw the frisbee. it was beautiful today. went on a walk. lovely weather. sat on the front porch with greg and read. organized some stuff at my apartment. worked on a puzzle.  ok, i'll admit, i watched part (yes, only part) of "weakest link" tonight. it was the playmate episode. and they were stupid girls. really. hardly banked anything the two rounds i watched. yes, only two rounds.
