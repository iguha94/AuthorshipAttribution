         i'm a little disappointed in the weather. (yes, the weather again. it's a routine subject in my life.) it was suppose to be 72 degrees today. i mean, i know meterologists can be wrong, but still...i was hopeful. and now my hopes for warmth were shattered. ok, i'm being dramatic, but still. it's cloudy and disappointing outside. good thing there's more to life than the weather. otherwise i'd be a mess. besides, it's not freezy outside by any means. i am wearing open-toed shoes and sleeveless sweater and i was barely chilly when i walked across the street for lunch.  ryan and i used to hang out at the denny's on hurstborne lane. (why is it technically called "hurstborne parkway" but everyone - well, probably not EVERYONE, but you know what i mean - calls it "hurstborne lane"?) the seat cushions used to be mismatched shades of not-so-lovely colors, but then the restaurant got a minor face lift with matching pinkish cushions. ryan and i drank a lot of milkshakes and talked a lot there. ah, the memories.  but now it's a fazoli's. while fazoli's is tasty and i ate there last night... it's no denny's.  those breadsticks were pretty good, though. i'll guess i'll adapt. and maybe i should take as one of life's many changes. maybe it's a good lesson for me. or maybe denny's in louisville wasn't doing too well. apparently most of them closed. thankfully, there's still one by village 8 for memory's sake though.   yeah, i know, that's entirely enough about that.
