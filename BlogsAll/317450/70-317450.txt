         after a summer-fun weekend in murray, i'm ready to move there. some of you may remember how ready i was to leave murray after i graduated. but two years in louisville and lexington have made me appreciate the small town. this weekend we hung out with greg's family and jaclyn and bryan -- we went swimming in the pool at greg's aunt and uncle's house and in kentucky lake. we had a picnic. i got beat in bowling, but sitll had fun. jaclyn and i picked out paint for the house greg and i are going to live in. it's fabulous, really. the world slows down in murray, which puts my  mind at ease.   i only have 14 more days at work. that's counting today. monday night we're leaving for florida with my family. it's the first family vacation we've been on since i was in high school. it's my parents, kevin and his girlfriend laine, cassie and greg and i. it should be a lot of fun, especially being able to hang out with them before greg and i move to murray. although murray isn't the edge of the earth like some people (ryan...) think it is. after vacation i have only nine days left at work before we move. there's a few days between finishing my job here and moving, and those are reserved for katie's wedding and our first-year anniversary.   THEN after we move, which we plan on doing aug. 5, we're going on vacation to the smoky mountains with greg's family. yea, the beach AND the mountains within a month or so. we have some pretty great families.
