         greg and i went on our first date five years ago today. we went out for ice cream at baskin robbins. then we actually ended up staying up all night talking. the ice cream date was planned, but the all-night talking was a pleasant surprise.   tired of all the kristin and greg landmark dates? well, i think this is the last of them for awhile.  this was a busy but great week for me.  tuesday night i went to see the indigo girls at UK. it was just them and their acoustic guitars, and occasionally a bango or mandolin. it was wonderful. laura and sarah come down from louisville to go, so it was also fun to see them. i sat with katie and brad. definitely good times. indigo girls played old and new song, really the perfect combination of both. and our seats were in the center of the third row.   wednesday i covered the education rally in frankfort. it was a neat experience to be with more than 20,000 educators trying to get legislators' attention to not cut education funding because of state budge shortfalls. while it was fun, i had to work late writing my story about that and another event i covered that day.   thursday was another long day at work because i had a school board meeting to cover that night.   but it's friday, and i've been off all day. quite the pleasant ending to a long week. i ate lunch with bethaney, a friend from our bible study. it was fun to talk with her because i don't know her all that well yet. i enjoy hanging out with new people. then i went to jc penny because i had some gift cards there.  tonight greg and i are going to baskin robbins, just like we did five years ago and most every year since. (there were even coupons in last sunday's paper, so we'll get a good deal on our ice cream!)
