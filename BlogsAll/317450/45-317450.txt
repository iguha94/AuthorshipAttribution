         my sister and i just watched "life or something like it." my expectations for the movie were exceeded. but that's probably because the timing was so ideal in my life. the movie reminded me of some things:  my life is not in my control.  matters of the heart are more important than anything, including careers and money.  authenticity brings joy to those around us.   also, cassie and i were talking in the theater before the movie started. she was talking about kevin and said, "you know, he and i aren't friends (pause) like you and i are." i really appreciated that comment.  God's been super good to my heart today, and much of that started with this song, which i listened to several times today:   I'm trading my sorrow I'm trading my shame I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord  I'm trading my sickness I'm trading my pain I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord   And we say yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord Yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord Yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord Amen  I'm pressed but not crushed persecuted not abandoned Struck down but not destroyed I'm blessed beyond the curse for his promise will endure  And his joy's gonna be my strength Though the sorrow may last for the night His joy comes with the morning  -darrell evans' "trading my sorrows"  two interviews down yesterday. now i just have to wait. that's the hard part. well, selling myself isn't completely comfortable either, but this waiting sure takes patience. well, duh.  pray for bekah's family. her dad died yesterday after he had a heart attack while he was working out at the YMCA. it was totally unexpected, especially because he had a heart attack before, but worked diligently to get himself in ideal health. i know bekah is trying to be strong for her mom. keep her whole family in your thoughts.
