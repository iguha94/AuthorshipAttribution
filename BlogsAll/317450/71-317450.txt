         i have 162 postcards. the majority of those made a lovely border in our bedroom. others will be incorporated in our new bedroom in murray, which will continue the travel-themed decor. postcards really are great and i love that people think enough of me to bring them or send them to me. my editors gave me two madison county postcards with my going-away gift yesterday. (that happened to be an EKU t-shirt. i'm developing an OVC collection -- murray state, austin peay, eastern.) anyway, i wasn't expecting my last day of work to be sad. but it was. i just really enjoyed the people there. i liked my job, but that's a lot easier to leave than the people who became my friends. that's what is weird about moving. it just jumbles everything. but i sure am looking forward to moving it to the sycamore house and being in the same town as jaclyn. we have big plans to grill out lots of dinner and walk, both as a social activity and exercise.   we move monday. then tuesday we are going on vacation with greg's family. we're staying in a cabin in the smoky mountains. it's not gatlinburg. but somewhere near there. i'm just looking forward to relaxing.   i still don't have a job, which will probably begin to worry me. but i shouldn't worry. at least greg has a job. maybe this is suppose to be a season about learning not to worry and to trust God. that's a lesson i tend to be taught over and over again. wonder when i will learn. that's life, though.   tonight is katie and brad's rehearsal dinner. then the wedding is tomorrow. i'm so excited. and as happy as i am for them, i know it's going to be a bit sad because they are moving to boston. that's far. again, my life feels slightly jumbled. katie and brad are great together, and i am so blessed by watching their relationship stay centered on God and what he has in store for them. katie and i have been friends for about 14 years. wow.   alright, i'm off to finish packing. as jaclyn said, i need to "get crackin' on packin.'"
