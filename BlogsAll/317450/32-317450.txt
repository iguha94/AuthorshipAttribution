         i went to kroger this afternoon, and the electricity was out in this area. it's weird to be in the grocery store with only a few lights on. they must have a pretty good back-up system because the credit card thing still worked and it was light enough to see in there. i went to get some drinks and medicine because i don't feel very good. i don't want to get sick. well, i think i had a fever last night. i slept terrible and eventually got the best sleep from 7 a.m.-noon on my couch. what is it about sleeping on a couch when i'm sick that makes things a little better? who knows, i just wish my headache would go away. i need to look for jobs and start writing those dreaded cover letters. and i need to do laundry. but all i really want to do is curl up on my couch. at least i'm off work again today.  last night kevin and i went to tumbleweed and then the UofL basketball game. we had a good time. with my brother, i never know how things are going to be. we talked a lot about basketball, but some about what's going on his life. regardless, we had a good time. kevin hugged me before he left. it was really sweet because that's not usually how we are. i hoping he's starting to accept the fact that while we are really different people, we can meet in the middle and have a good time. that's a growing up thing, i guess.  oh, and it hailed here this afternoon. it was crazy stuff. but i really liked the sound of it bouncing off the window.
