         Life is often full of contradictions. I want to be spontaneous. Yet I a planner and focus on details. I love road trips, but would rather someone else drive. I wish I could wear flip flops all year around, but I love socks. I like my feet to be rubbed. But my feet are ticklish. Summer is my favorite season, but I love snuggling up in blankets. I like to be in control. I like to follow the leader. I like attention. I hate to be the center of attention. I couldn't wait to move out of my parents' house. Now I can't wait to visit. I avoid drama. But I am emotionally high maintenance. I avoid conflict. But I want to talk about everything. I love to eat. I don't really know much about cooking. I miss living in Louisville and Lexington. I find peace in the convenience of Murray. CSI is my favorite show. I get nervous in the dark by myself. I like my house clean and organized. I can't remember the last time I washed my car.  Change makes me hesitant. Routines make me antsy. Yellow is my favorite color. I wear a lot of blue and black. I love listening to music. I can't sing a lick. Christmas is my favorite holiday. I don't like snow. I want to live at the lake. I don't fish. I think e-mail is fabulous. I love writing and receiving "real" letters. The Internet is an endless resource. But I'd rather read newspapers and magazines. I rarely drink milk. I love eating cereal. I love hugs. I have to sleep on my own side of the bed.  Friends are suppose to be forever. I haven't talked to Cara since January. I love to laugh. I'm not afraid to cry. I like to talk. I like to ask questions and listen. I'm a writer. I hate to speak in front of people. I was a shy kid. I call and talk to strangers on a daily basis at work. I am task-oriented. I am good at procrastinating.  I am a University of Kentucky basketball fan. I like Rick Pitino and Mike Davis. I love college basketball. Dick Vitale is annoying. Life is full of contradictions. Life can be whatever I want it to be.
