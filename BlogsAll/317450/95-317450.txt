         "Unload all your worries onto him, since he is looking after you." --1 Peter 5:7  "You and I are governed. The weather determines what we wear. The terrain tells us how to travel. Gravity dictates our speed, and health determines our strength. We may challenge these forces and alter them slightly, but we never remove them. God -- our Shepherd -- doesn't check the weather; he makes it. He doesn't defy gravity; he created it. He isn't affected by health; he has no body. Jesus said, 'God is spirit.' Since he has no body, he has no limitations -- equally active in Cambodia as he is in Connecticut." -- Max Lucado in "Traveling Light"  "Relationships change. Health changes. The weather changes. But the Yaweh who ruled the earth last night is the same Yaweh who rules it today. Same convictions. Same plan. Same mood. Same love. He never changes. You can no more alter God than a pebble can alter the rhythm of the Pacific." -- Max Lucado in "Traveling Light"  "People take a measure of your vision, your character. They really want to know how you can affect their lives -- whether they can trust you," Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry on people's perceptions of politicians, but maybe more so on life.  All of these other people's words to say I am a more complex person than I like to admit. I hate fickleness but sometimes can't make up my mind. I despise change but grow restless with routine. I have faith God is greater than any detail of my life, yet I strive for perfection. I yearn for simplicity in a complex life. And it is good to know when I have my milkshake moments, God is steadfast.
