         I love "When Harry Met Sally..." The movie is built on conversations, and I like that. Watching it, I feel like I know Harry and Sally. Jaclyn says she's going to "invite Harry and Sally" over when she watches it. It's really like that. Anyway, there are fabulous conversation and much bickering between Harry and Sally. I always wished I could write fast enough to get it all. This afternoon I found a   Web site  that has much of the good dialogue quoted with other descriptions from the movie.   I thought I'd include one of my favorites:   While watching "Casablanca:"   Harry : There are two kinds of women: high maintenance and low maintenance.  Sally : And Ingrid Bergman is low maintenance?  Harry : An L.M. Definitely.  Sally : Which one am I?  Harry : You're the worst kind. You're high maintenance, but you think you're low maintenance.  Sally : I don't see that.  Harry : You don't see that. (He mimics her typical ordering procedure.) 'Waiter, I'll begin with the house salad, but I don't want the regular dressing. I'll have balsamic vinegar and oil, but on the side, and then the salmon with the mustard sauce, but I want the mustard sauce on the side.' 'On the side' is a very big thing for you.  Sally : Well, I just want it the way I want it.  Harry : I know, high maintenance. (Sally sighs after Bogart says the final line of the film, when the two characters walk off into the fog-shrouded airport: 'Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.') Ooh. Best last line of a movie ever.
