         Alright, I haven't addressed Kentucky losing to UAB in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. And that's precisely why -- Kentucky lost to UAB, a Conference USA team, in the second round. They didn't make it to the Sweet Sixteen with a team that dominated the SEC, a much stronger, tougher conference than Conference USA. People want to pick one moment -- a turnover, a charge call, a missed shot -- on which to hang the lose. But really a basketball game shouldn't come down to one moment. UAB did more things right in the game, even though the referees were apparently in their own world calling random fouls. Kentucky lacked energy and emotion in that game and previous against Florida A&M. I think sometimes teams bring too much emotion to the court, but I think sometimes teams need something to motivate them and Kentucky lacked whatever that is for its players. I think they got sort of cocky, and came out looking past these lower-seeded teams. They didn't play defense, they didn't play their game. I don't want to blame Tubby. He obviously does something right to get teams, especially the last two year's, to gel. But he doesn't do well in the tournament. He coaches the "team to beat," but doesn't lead them farther in the tournament everyone is watching. Sure, he won a championship in 1998, technically, but did so with players Pitino recruited and trained. All of this to say, the Wildcats shouldn't have lost, but they did. Good thing it's all a game.
