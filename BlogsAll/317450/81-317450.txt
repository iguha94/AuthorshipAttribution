         alright,  the randomness that is my life...  This is HILARIOUS: Do you want to know what our economists do all day? Click on this   Web site  and move the cursor over the image.  This also makes me laugh: Here's a conversation between George W. Bush and his daughter... A father watched his daughter playing in the garden. He smiled as he reflected on how sweet and innocent his little girl was. Suddenly she just stopped and stared at the ground. He went over to her and noticed she was looking at two spiders mating.  "Daddy, what are those two spiders doing?" she asked.  "They're mating," her father replied.  "What do you call the spider on top, Daddy?" she asked.  "That's a Daddy Longlegs, " Her father answered.  A pause! "So, the other one is Mommy Longlegs?" the little girl asked.  "No," her father replied. "Both of them are Daddy Longlegs."  The little girl thought for a moment, then took her foot and stomped them flat."Well, that might be OK in California and New York, but we're not having any of that stuff in Texas!"  Other random notes: When Greg and I were in Louisville this weekend we saw Gerald Fitch in the mall. He was walking with a cute, little boy and another guy. I really wanted to talk to him, but I'm a star-struck chicken. Oh well.   I went to my second-ever NBA game last night. We went to Memphis to watch the Golden State Warriors beat the Grizzlies. (Are there really bears in Tennessee? They should change the mascot, really.) It was fun.
