         ok, i've totally neglected this blog, although not as much as ryan.   thanksgiving was good. wednesday and thursday greg and i hung out with my family. then we went to murray for the weekend. i had a great time both places. we also went to see murray state play in the division I-aa playoffs against western. the racers got their butts kicked 59-20. it was still fun, and warmer than i expected.   we played cranium with my family at carolyn and jerry's house and lots of rook and other card games with greg's family. you all know how i love games, and friendly competition. it was also great to see cassie and meet her friend kay, who is from colorado and plays soccer at austin peay.   yesterday before we came back from murray, we hung out with jaclyn and bryan. as always, it was fun, especially because i have been in jaclyn withdrawl. jaclyn and i are in mourning that we can't spend new years together as we have the last couple of years, but we realize that eventually we may live in the same town, which would make those occasions easier.   in a recent entry, i talked about working on a chrysalis weekend in louisville. now greg is working on it also. that will make driving to tonight's planning meeting much better. he's good company.   i'm so in the christmas spirit. i'm going to put up our tree as soon as a i get a chance. there are already wrapped presents to put under it! i also hope i get to finish christmas shopping this weekend and work on our christmas cards. ok, i'm a nerd, but it's fun. instead of spending much on each other, greg and i shopped for two angel tree kids this year -- a girl and a boy, both 12.
