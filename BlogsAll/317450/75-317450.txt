         I just re-read a lot of my online journal, which I started in August 2001. It's crazy all that has changed since then, and it's funny how much I talk about change. There are these lessons I know I'm suppose to learn, but have to be taught over and over again, and accepting change is definitely one of the them. The biggest thing for me right now is that I open myself up to change, specifically not being so anal about everything. There are times I should strive for perfection, but there are many more times I should be blessed by change and all it involves, including relaxing and take life as it comes. God is mightier than anything I know or do. I really need to rest in the fact life is life and I am not in control.   On that note, it's sad to me how caught up people get in work and routine, not leaving much time for people. I talk about how I only have two friends. But in this disappointing sense it is true. I have friends all over the country, but it seems more often than not we make excuses about not calling or slacking with the emails.   OK, I haven't commented on here about the election. Go Republicans! I say that like it is a ball game. But Ernie Fletcher is Kentucky's next governor, and the first Republican to do so in 32 years. That's a long time of one party at the top. But I did vote for two Democrats, the first time I haven't voted a straight-party ticket. Whatever that is worth.
