         I had a good weekend. Greg came to see me Friday night. We watched the Kentucky game and played an intense game of Uno at Dave's on Saturday. Then I worked. Greg came downtown that night so we could eat at my favorite Mexican restaurant. After church on Sunday we played games (euchre, hearts and password) with Katie and Aaron at my apartment. Four competitive people playing games makes for a fun time. Greg and I won password. Greg won hearts. Katie and Aaron won euchre. Oh, then Aaron got Tetris out. That becomes quite an obsession, especially when Aaron kept initiating all these challenges. The best: who could get the most lines on level 19. Do you know how fast those pieces fall on level 19? Stinkin' fast. Anyway, guess who won. Yep, me. I got 14 lines on level 19. We also watched football yesterday. I love it that lots of those promotions for the Super Bowl have "Desire" by U2 on them. I can't wait for halftime. Not being a NFL fan, I haven't really followed any teams all year. I have some opinions, but they are that deep and don't really go that far. Here they are: I like that the Browns beat the Ravens twice this season. I like that the Bengals got off to a better start than the Titans. Kurt Warner is a good guy. OK, that's about it. Conclusion: I'm cheering for the Rams. Yes, that was decided before they beat the Packers yesterday.
