         Busy, busy weekend.  We went to eat with some new friends Friday evening. Noah and Denette had us over to their apartment for corn and chicken chowder and cheesecake. It was good food. And we played euchre with some new friends. Then later that night I had to go back to work to finish up Saturday's paper and send it to press.   Saturday morning Jaclyn and I went to several yard sales. I found a few deals. Then my mom and dad came to visit. We ate lunch, then my mom and I went to Paducah, shopping for curtains. Yes, after living here two months, I have curtains to put up. Dad and Greg watched football while we were doing that. That evening Greg and I went to his parents' house for chicken and dumplins. Yummy. It was sort of celebration dinner for Greg passing the bar.   Yesterday we went to the Titans game in Nashville, then stopped to eat in Clarksville. Conveniently, we stopped about the same time Cassie was finishing up her soccer game, so Mom and Cassie got to eat with us. My dad had already left to go back to Indianapolis, where he is doing a lot of consulting work.   Austin Peay has improved to four wins, two of which came this weekend. I'm looking forward to watching Cassie play against Murray State in two weeks. Go Peay!  So, now after not much rest this weekend, I'm back in the swing of work. Although, I did go to bed at 9 last night. It was a fun weekend, though, so I don't mind sacrificing some sleep.
