         i had to make a new hole in my black belt this morning. (good thing greg and i got a new set of knifes with a jc penny gift certificate this weekend.) i've lost between 10 and 15 pounds the last few months, which is good but frustrating. it obviously makes me feel good, but none of my pants fit very well. and the thing is, i haven't changed my eating habits, but i've been drinking lots more water.   our christmas with my family was good. we got a new 32-inch TV, which is significantly bigger than the TV we were borrowing from my aunt and uncle. our parents each pitched in toward our new one.   i've seen several movies during the last week -- "two weeks notice," "catch me if you can" and "gangs in new york." i'd recommend the first two. i honestly can't believe i watched two leonardo dicaprio movies. i don't like him, bu t will admit he was good in both "catch me if you can" and "gangs in new york." i couldn't watch "gangs in new york" again, though. it made me tense, and i covered my eyes several times. "two weeks notice" made me laugh a lot. and "catch me if you can" was clever.   the wildcats weren't looking so hot saturday. i wanted to call adam and comment on temple's win over the hoosiers, but decided i really didn't have any room to talk about that as a UK fan.
