         Laura commented on heterological. I figured she would. (Remember the onomatopoeia entry?)  Today was my day off, spent pretty much entirely with Lori. No complaints, though. It was totally great girl time. We went to lunch at Ditto's, where I think I have never been. Then we watched "The Royal Tenenbaums." Hilarious. One of my favorite lines was when Margot (Gwenyth Paltrow) said she met this guy when she was in the ocean and he just rowed up in a canoe. Yep, a movie filled with completely random stuff - of course I would like it. And it was actually intelligent, no just random humor. Then we drove around the neighborhood Rick Pitino supposedly lives in. Like we could pick out which oversized home is his. But seriously, these houses are amazing, although really nobody I know lives in such places. Some of them reminded me of bed and breakfast resort-type places where rich people would vacation. Of course, normal is relative, much like weird, and to some people those mega-homes are as normal as grilled cheese, tator tots and Dr. Pepper are to me. Anyway, then Lori and I ate dinner with her two roommates. Then it was "Dawson's Creek" time, followed by "Glory Days," the new Wednesday WB show until "Felicity" comes back in April. It's another Kevin Williamson product, probably why it totally reminded me of "Dawson's Creek" meets "Scream." The first week got my approval, but we'll have to give it another episode or two to prove itself. Right, like I'm such the qualified critic.  I feel like Lori and I have been friends for a long time, but really only since sometime in September. God's way of placing the perfect people in our paths is planned better than I could ever dream. I was going for the p alliteration there, but ran out of perfect p words toward the end. You know, paraphernalia and plethora are good p words, but they weren't going to fit in that phrase perfectly.
