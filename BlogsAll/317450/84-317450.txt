         I love this weather, even though it's making our house a bit warm. I wore flip flops today and walked outside barefoot.   We went to see "The Ladykillers" this afternoon. It was funnier than I expected. Tom Hanks did a good job. Very entertaining.   I'm glad we don't have any pets of our own, but it's nice having Bailey around. She took a nap with me this morning. (When you wake up at 7 a.m. on a weekend, it's OK to take a nap at 10:30 or so.) She wants to be involved in everything, but it's cute most of the time. The exception would be when I was working on a puzzle and she walked through it. Maybe I shouldn't be working a puzzle on the floor, but I was. Speaking of the puzzle, I bought it for 50 cents this morning at a yard sale. And the money went to Relay for Life. It's called "Yellow," creatively named because everything in the puzzle is yellow. There are smiley faces, toys, crayons, lemons, yarn, Juicy Fruit and Chiclet gum packages...a very little that isn't yellow.   KatieKerns called me today. I write her name like that because it's fun to say quick, letting it all run together. Anyway, I sure miss her. Hopefully she and Brad are going to move from Boston to Nashville next year. That would be so great.   Greg's sitting on the back porch playing his guitar. It's nice to listen to. It's a summertime thing he always does.   That's all my babble for now.
