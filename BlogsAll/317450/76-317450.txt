         The randomness that is my life: --Greg and I have been to five Christmas dinners or parties in that past 10 days and we have at least three to go. The most random was the Murray Fire Department dinner. I was invited because I cover the department as part of my city beat at work. Last night was the big Taylor Christmas party. There were about 40 people there. I could tell it was a Taylor function when we pulled up in the driveway because there were lots of Chevy vehicles -- especially Suburbans -- all backed in. For those of you who don't know, Greg's great-uncle is a Chevy dealer and all Taylor men back in parking places.  --Jaclyn and I went to see "Mona Lisa Smile" yesterday afternoon. It wasn't as good as I was hoping, but a cute, fairly predictable moving. Greg and I watched "Something's Got to Give" earlier in the week, and it was funny. Jack Nicholason's character was great, actually all four man characters were.  --I finished Christmas shopping today, unless I find Greg another stocking stuffer or two. --Kentucky had an impressive win over Indiana yesterday. --The Titans pulled out a win today. --Every day I realize I act more and more like my mother. Speaking of mom, I am really looking forward to going to visit my family next weekend. Then we'll come back so I can work for a few days and go back to Oldham County for New Year's Eve and Day. And we're going to the Austin Peay-Kentucky game in Louisville on Dec. 31.
