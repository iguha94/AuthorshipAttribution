         Sometimes I get hooked on a song - not necessarily a new song, just a song that fits my mood - and I play it repeatedly in my car. Lately that song has been "New Horizons" by David Gray.   Weight on my shoulders but Im walking so tall out into the new horizon wonder in everything no matter how great or small howlin' like the midnight howlin' like the midnight sun and this ain't no pale reflection this is the real thing new horizon new horizon within  And your heart ain't yours to control no matter how tight the reins love will find it's own direction a time to reap, a time to sow and many a time to cry in vain but now the time to celebrate  the glory of this imperfection same thing that's scrawled across the stars is written under our skin new horizon  new horizon within  Things come too easy, I get suspicious things come too slow, I get bored if it don't work out I get superstitious but if it does, oh my word  So Im gathering all the remnants of beauty from this wilderness in spin and now Im gonna light my own flame 'cause Im charged with the radiance of the dawn that's been so long breaking now there ain't nowhere there ain't nowhere I won't write your name there's a time to search for understanding sometime you just gotta sing new horizon new horizon within  Baby there's no need to get precious when you know that everything must change complacency, it can be so vicious turn this love into a cage  Same thing that's scrawled across the stars is written under our skin new horizon  new horizon within
