         i wish today would have been a completely different kind of day. aside from the fact that i felt sick most of the day, i got in an argument with a friend. yes, my feelings were hurt, but i still responded in a completely selfish, jerkish way. then besides hurting my friend's feelings, i felt like such a bad person. i want to love people and be there for people, not treat them like their lives don't matter. it's like i talked about a few days ago about apperciating people wholeheartedly, like God wants me to. then i just sort of freaked out about life, well, all the uncertainties in life. where am i going to work? where are we going to have this wedding reception? am i going to be a good wife? blah, blah, blah... and you know, God doesn't want me beating myself up like that. sure, God breaks us at the moments he sees fit. and obviously today he wanted to get some work done on my heart. sometimes it feels awfully crappy when it happens, but then the brokenness turns into a sort of challenge to be a better person, to be more of who God wants me to be. so, while i wish today was a different kind of day, maybe crying multiple times today served some higher purpose. i'm not in control of my life or any of the circumstances in it. sure, i make decisions and must put forth effort, but ultimately someone sits on his throne, seeing the eternal picture, and asks me to surrender my ideals and expectations to him.  and it's good to know true friends forgive me when i make mistakes.
