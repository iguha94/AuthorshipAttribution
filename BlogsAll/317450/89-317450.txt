         I've been accused of thinking too much. And while I am trying not to analyze every word someone speaks to me, I find myself analyzing whether I analyze. It's a vicious trap, really.  So, the other thing I've been thinking about is whether I'm needy. Do I depend on people too much for attention? Earlier this week I wrote on here about a friend of mine who makes me feel suffocated at times. The key words are "at times." I enjoy her conversations and we have a lot in common, but other times I just wish she didn't require so much attention and talk about herself so much. With that said, I wonder if I'm like that to anyone. I sure hope not. Greg has told me I depend on people too much. But too much is relative, I think. He doesn't depend on people for much. Self-sufficient, if you will. I like people. I like to talk. I like to listen. I like hugs and I like to feel like people need me. That's human, though, I think. Still, where's the line of loving people and being needy? So, I've come to the conclusion that I have my needy moments like a mood swing, but the necessity for others doesn't dominate my life. With that said, I also think it's different living in Murray right now. I know lots of people, but I only confide in a few. I meet new people all of the time, but I only have a couple of friends here. And maybe I seem needy because the people I actually want to spend time with are limited. But thank God for them.
