         katie and aaron got married this weekend. i introduced them, so that made it even more fun to be part of their wedding. everything went really well, excluding the 45 minutes one of the other bridesmaids, jill, spent sewing me into my dress. yes, literally. the zipper decided not to work, thanks to some terrible sewing on the dress lady's part. so jill just sewed me in, and i basically had to be cut out of it that night. i also had some unexpected bonding time with andrea, thanks again to the dress lady and her lack of responsibility. andrea and i sat at the dress lady's house for 1 1/2 hours after the rehearsal dinner. i got talk to adam some, which was good, despite his on-going bashing of UK. yeah, like he has a whole lot of room to talk, though. jared jeffries is leaving IU.   yesterday i slept late. yay! then greg and i ate at rafferty's, ran errands and hung out. oh, and we watched "finding forrester." i love that movie.   why is it the words we write for ourselves are so much better than those we write for others?  -sean connery as william forrester  last night lori and her roommate shelley and kelly and i went to see "the sweetest thing." it was not the greatest movie ever made. but it sure was better than "something about mary," to which critics keep comparing it. we laughed a lot - in the movie and out - and probably annoyed those sitting near us in applebee's.
