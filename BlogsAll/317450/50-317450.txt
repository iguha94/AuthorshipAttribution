         great song:   Baby I've been searching like everybody else Can't say nothing different about myself Sometimes I'm an angel And sometimes I'm cruel And when it comes to love I'm just another fool Yes, I'll climb a mountain I'm gonna swim the sea There ain't no act of God girl Could keep you safe from me My arms are reaching out Out across this canyon I'm asking you to be my true companion True companion True companion  So don't you dare and try to walk away I've got my heart set on our wedding day I've got this vision of a girl in white Made my decision that it's you allright And when I take your hand I'll watch my heart set sail I'll take my trembling fingers And I'll lift up your veil Then I'll take you home And with wild abandon Make love to you just like a true companion You are my true companion I got a true companion True companion  When the years have done irreparable harm I can see us walking slowly arm in arm Just like the couple on the corner do 'Cause girl I will always be in love with you And when I look in your eyes I'll still see that spark Until the shadows fall Until the room grows dark Then when I leave this Earth I'll be with the angels standin' I'll be out there waiting for my true companion Just for my true companion True companion True companion   -Marc Cohen "True Companion"
