7:43 a.m. Monday, Day 85.  Feel okay today, considering I had red wine and wasabi peas last night. Took half an actifed and half a melatonin so I would sleep better, and I think it worked. It was a little hard getting up, but I feel fine now.  My numbers from last week are SO bad, that I’m not even going to spend time bitching about it. It could have been worse, and I’m doing the best I can. So now let’s just move on to this week.  9:18 a.m. Just took my Monday Measurements, and I seem to be down half an inch or so in every measurement except my waist.  It makes no sense - I must have lost in my waist to be able to fit in the Measurement Pants, but it never shows up with the tape. Oh well, I guess that’s why I need several different methods of tracking progress, no one of them works consistently enough. Anyway, good news that I am down in some areas. Speaking of the Measurement Pants, I am wearing them today but they seem a bit snugger than last time. I may indeed have put on a pound, or perhaps my stomach is bigger than usual today.  11:33 a.m. Just back from the dentist. I am so sleepy!  Not sure why.  Also hungry, so I’m drinking a glass of water to try to push lunch at least until noon. Speaking of water, I have peed at least eight times already this morning. Something I ate or drank yesterday must be causing it. Maybe the actifed.  Here’s what I’ve decided: when I can fit into the Measurement Shorts, then I will get weighed and take another progress photo.
