6:45 a.m. Tuesday, Day 120. Feeling quite chipper this morning. Not quite enough sleep, I woke up at 5:30, but I’m doing okay. Dreams? Yes. Brief version: Dominick Dunne was on his way to prison for refusing to reveal a source on the stand, and I ran into him in the airport (?) as he said his farewells to family and friends. I rushed up to him and gushed all over in a fan-like way, and instead of being repulsed, he immediately loved me and promised to write to me from jail. Also Daisy was there, and he totally ignored her. It is unkind of me to be catty and jealous, but in my dream I was all “Ha ha, see, I’m WAY hotter than you,” which is significant because in real life Daisy is not only incredibly beautiful but has actually met Dominick Dunne.  So I managed 1224 calories yesterday. I can’t brag; it’s mostly because I missed lunch, and that’s not something I want to make a habit of. Other good news today — tried on the Measurement Shorts, and I think I see some progress. They were  almost  wearable. Way too snug in the butt for comfort, but I could almost conceive of wearing them. It’s such a tiny hint of progress, but more than I’ve seen for a month, so I am considerably heartened and remotivated.  12:32 p.m. I just dug up three giant bushes out of our front yard, roots and all. That was HARD work, so combined with my gliding today I think I’ve got my exercise accomplished.  5:27 p.m. Well, this has been a productive day. Besides the bush digging, I also formatted the proposal for four hours, finished the piano bench, primed the windsor chair, and did two loads of laundry. I rule. AND as of this moment I’m only at 754 calories, which means I have plenty available for dinner and still stay within goal. Rock rock rock!
