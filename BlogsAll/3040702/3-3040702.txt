Compiling this list was harder than I expected. Oh, I could probably reel off a hundred books without much effort, but as soon as I began it became apparent how many of the hundred were by the same authors. I could list my favorites of James Michener, Robert Heinlein, Georgette Heyer, and Graham Greene, and be done with it in four authors. That doesn't seem like a really good representation, so I've trimmed multiple mentions to the minimum, including more than one by an author only when it was very notable to me. In a couple instances, I just couldn't decide between a couple books by the same author, and listed them together with a slash between.  I wanted to limit this to fiction, to novel-length writing, and that also threw me for a loop a few times. I realized I couldn't include Walden or Up From Slavery. Likewise O'Henry, Tillie Olsen, and Truman Capote, whose writings are short stories â€” at least, of those I've read. I love Tolstoy's short stories, but couldn't make it through War and Peace if you paid me, so he's out. I've allowed it in a few instances (Kipling, Bradbury) when the collection has a common theme or thread that unifies the stories.  The most important discriminator is that these are my  favorite  novels, not necessarily the  best  novels, the highest quality. This is a purely personal list of what I enjoy, and some of them are pretty cheesy. Some books that I like and are patently worthwhile, such as The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck and The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, didn't make the cut, simply because I don't like them as much as some other novel that may be less deserving but more to my particular taste.   At first I ordered these in descending order of preference or impact, but found I couldn't really do it that way. It's too often a matter of apples and oranges. However, there are some books that had a truly significant impact on my life, that caused me to think differently, to live differently. Frequently, these are books I read when I was quite young (9 or 10 years old; I had a "college level" reading ability since second grade and read adult books from about 8 years old on), and they had enormous influence on my values and aspirations. I've marked these with an asterisk, and I still think they are wonderful stories, but be warned that a couple of them are very cheesy indeed.  Eventually I decided to order them alphabetically, by title. Not by author, because that grouping is not necessarily relevant. I like the randomness of alpha by title. It would take me forever to link them all to Amazon or whatnot, so if you're interested, you can research them yourself.
