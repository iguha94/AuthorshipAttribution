9:12 a.m. Saturday, Day 83.  Yesterday sucked!  Dammit!  It was that stupid hamburger, and everything that led up to it.  The chicken rice soup was too watery and so left me hungry, then lunch was about two hours late so that I was over-hungry and decided it was a good idea to get a giant hamburger. I don’t know what the hell I was thinking. I guess something like “Oh, I can go off plan once in a while. I’ll just eat nothing tonight.”  And of course that didn’t work, because of course I was HUNGRY in the evening. Duh. Just because something has a lot of calories doesn’t mean it’s filling.  So I sat around eating celery and pickles and drinking wine, which made me too drunk and did not appease the hunger at all, until finally I was smart enough to have a little piece of salmon at 9:30, which of course disrupted my sleep and I stayed up too late, got up too late, and now feel kind of icky. And also stupid.  Bah. Okay, time to move on. I know what went wrong and will avoid the situation in future. That means that I will eat enough food, I will not starve myself!  Added about a third cup of kasha to my soup, to make it more filling.  It sure increased the calories, but after yesterday I’m going to err on the conservative side, and make sure I’m eating enough of something healthy so I don’t go overboard and eat crap.  12:55 p.m. Chicken and sweet potato for lunch. And more water. I’m trying to increase my water, which has fallen by the wayside. It will also help with the hunger. I feel like I’m starting from scratch, and having to relearn how to do this. Thank god I didn’t gain ten pounds on vacation.  Although I’m still sort of waiting for the axe to fall, because I figure it takes a little while for the effects of diet to show up, and I might still have an increase over the next week or so. Hope not, but I will TRY not to freak out if I do.  In fact, after I finish this glass of water, I will go glide for a while.
