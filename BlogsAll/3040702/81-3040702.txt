7:05 a.m. Wednesday. Feeling pretty good today. My last couple hours of sleep were choppy, but I went to bed so early I’m sure I got at least eight hours. Took half an actifed to counter the red wine, and I didn’t drink enough water to counteract them both. Other than that, feeling good, and I’m pleased with the amount I drank for Drinking Night. My new plan is to buy only red wine, and buy only enough for the one drinking night.  If I don’t have it around the house, I won’t drink it. Because I am far too lazy and too self-conscious to go buy it. Therefore, this way I am not relying on willpower, I’m setting up an environment where I can’t drink. I’m having a glass of water right now, with my coffee.  I don’t usually start until after breakfast, but I feel quite dehydrated.  I’m adjusting my estimates for the coffee with Benefiber, because I’m not putting an entire tablespoon in. Maybe two-thirds that.  Note: remember to buy an exercise ball to sit on while at the computer.  5:00 p.m. Had a nice little lunch with Daisy. Ate a veggie wrap and some fries, which I hope I am estimating reasonably.  It was a decent meal, but not entirely filling, so I had a little chicken when I got home.  Now I am finishing up my work emailing before vacation, trying to do my timesheet, etc.  My hip is still bothering me. I’m not happy about that, because it hurts when I walk, and I want to do a lot of walking on vacation. I think the bellydancing may have caused the strain, and then the gliding is exacerbating it. So perhaps it’s a good thing that I’ll be away from the glider for a couple weeks. I can walk and swim for exercise, and perhaps that will work out the problem, whatever it is.
