6:46 a.m. Tuesday, Day 86.  Feel pretty good today. I slept decently; woke up a few times but went right back to sleep. Also had normal dreams!  I think that’s the melatonin. I’m sore today from TotalGym, and so are my abs. I kept my feet off the platform for some of it, and it works the abdominals that way.  A lot.  Yesterday had much better numbers. I’m thrilled to be below 2k !  And I ate a lot, so I got good numbers and a lot of food.  A reasonable amount of water. I’m gradually working myself back into this. I really really want to start LOSING weight again, and I doubt I’ve done that for a couple weeks.   8:08 a.m. Spilled my soup when I was putting the second half away for tomorrow. I will have a little something extra for breakfast tomorrow. Trying to get some water down; I want to do a nice long glider workout today. I will pick out a movie to watch; there’s no way Dr. Phil is going to entertain me enough. Well, I can check and see what he’s got on, but even the commercials drive me to boredom and make me want to stop.  Plus I sort of hate him.   2:29 p.m. I finally have a blog up and running!  As I knew it would, it's taken me most of the day to get it going, and it's quite primitive. If anyone is reading this, you are probably thinking "But you have entries going back to December..."  Yes, that's because through the miracle of web technology, I am able to date entries whatever I want, so I can put up all my previous offline journal entries. Why would anyone want to read them? Hell if I know!
