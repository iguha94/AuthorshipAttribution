This was Daisy's idea - describe your perfect day, as is CURRENTLY POSSIBLE, in order to begin living that way. It's meant to be an exercise in deliberate living. When I wrote my perfect day, I sort of ignored that aspect of it, and wrote what my dream life would be like. It's very diet and fitness oriented, because that's where my head was (and is), but in general it's what I would consider an absolutely ideal day in a perfect universe:  Wake up at a reasonable time, not late and not crack-of-dawn.  Say 7:30.  Put on my bathing suit and walk out to the beach. Gather a few shells, breathe the sea air, have a little stroll, commune with nature. Jump in the water for a few minutes, to really wake up and clear my head. Back to the house, for coffee and a breakfast of fruit and seafood. Get dressed in a halter top and wrap-around skirt. Go to my studio for a few hours of creating masterpieces which sell for good prices to a small group of discriminating patrons. Walk to town and pick up some groceries. Have a giant salad with a glass of wine for a late lunch in a little cafe. Walk home. Read a good book for an hour, then lift weights for 30 minutes. Have a little nap and a shower with my beloved husband. Get dressed in something pretty and slinky, but no shoes. Make cocktails and hors d'oeuvres in my bright, colorful, funky kitchen, as my brilliant literary and artistic friends start dropping by in the early evening. Sit on the verandah drinking and talking, wolfing down canapes and bringing up epigrams. When we get hungry for dinner, whomp up a big batch of fresh seafood and pasta, open some wine, and stay up late talking and laughing and singing and dancing. Go for a midnight swim to clear our heads. Retire to my plush bedroom and write in my secret journal by candlelight. Tell all and name the names, for future publication. Go to bed and sleep deeply with pleasant dreams.
