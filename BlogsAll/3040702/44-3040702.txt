6:57 a.m. Sunday, last day of Week 8.  That’s the end of my two month “experiment.”  And I have come in just under the wire, being able to wear the Measurement Pants. So I’ll continue.  Not that there was any doubt, anyway. I realized a long time ago that I was going to do this for a year or more.  I can’t see giving up and resigning myself to more weight gain just because this isn’t going as fast as I would like.  9:32 a.m. Putting on the rubber molding in the kitchen. After that, put the dishwasher skirt back on, the heat register back on, and we’re done!   11:12 a.m. Having myself a little glide. Bucko’s working today at the Sheraton, god knows why. I’m a bit at loose ends, not sure what to do with myself. I’ve got the kitchen as far as I can take it, I can’t figure out the dishwasher, so now I’m having a glide while I watch tv.   3:07 p.m.  Not sure what I’ve been doing today, piddling around I guess. I painted the wall in the garage, which will look much neater.  Packed a little. Had a snack of lettuce salad, and I’m trying not to eat more. I’m a bit peckish, but I have to stop the habit of snacking every time I’m hungry.  I’ve slipped a little bit in the past few weeks, forgeting that I need to break some of my connection with food.  I don’t have to eat just because my stomach feels the teensiest bit empty. Also I want to have a glass of wine later this afternoon, so I need to leave room for that.
