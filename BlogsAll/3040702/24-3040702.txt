7:23 a.m. Friday, Day 19.  Can you believe â€” only two more days left in WEEK THREE?  So yesterday's eating wasn't as bad as I feared.  I expected a whopper total because of the sandwich and pizza, but when I add it up it's actually pretty good. I estimated big on those items, too.  Apparently I compensated with dinner, because that grilled shrimp salad is very low on the cals.  Also, I kept it to ONE piece of pizza, and didn't just keep eating and keep eating, which is what I felt like doing.  Man, what a hard habit to break.  So anyway, my totals ended up good, I'm completely on track, and glad yesterday is over.    I have a GIANT bruise on my arm this morning. A little souvenir.  I'm still feeling a bit aimless because of lack of visible progress.  Must keep pep-talking myself to get through a month.  I think that's the minimum fair amount of time to try this.  It freaks me out when I see other people losing 4 and 5 pounds in their first week, and I don't seem to have lost 4 pounds in three weeks. But, as always, I can't really tell whether that's true.  Is it completely idiotic that I don't have a scale?  I guess so, if I want to know my weight so badly.  It's just that I thought the Measurement Pants would work, and either they're not working or I have gained weight.  Haven't started my period yet, not surprising since I'm so irregular now, but I want it over so I can try the Pants again.  9:51 a.m.  40 minutes on the glider. Not bad.  I haven't been able to do the 60 minutes that I reached a couple times before, although I think I have been letting myself off the hook somewhat because of boredom.  Need to be a little firmer with myself.
