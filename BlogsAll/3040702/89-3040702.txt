7:06 a.m. Saturday, Day 117.  I could feel worse. I can’t pretend I feel  great,  not after four martinis, but it could be worse.  Yesterday was rather high in the calories, due to martinis and also the pork rib.  I realize I have to stop buying those things. They’re just so delicious slow cooked in the oven, and the bastards keep putting them on sale for 99 cents a pound. I’ve resisted them the last two or three times they were on sale, but caved in eventually, and we’ve had them for two days now. There are two leftover in the fridge right now, and either Bucko’s got to eat them or we have to throw them away, because I don’t want to have another 795 calorie rib.     These    guys  are doing an Immediate Challenge — to stay on program through the end of the month. Which right now is 7 days. I should do this too. I need a small goal, like I was writing about yesterday. Little, easily-managed, bite-sized goals. Yes, I really should do this. I should email Denise and say “Sign me up!”   Yes. Well. Maybe later. Or better yet, I’ll take the challenge, but I won’t tell anyone. That’s it. Sorry guys, I want to join in, but my brain has been too fragile lately. I know I’m letting myself off the hook. But I’m with you in spirit, okay?  I got a clothing catalog in the mail from TravelSmith. Probably the recent vacation has put me on a lot of mailing lists. Anyway, in this catalog, they don’t use models, they just show the clothing. Which is fine, it’s expensive to use models. It takes so many shots to get just the right one — not only does the clothing have to look good, but the model has to have both eyes open, no hair in the face, etc. In this catalog, they show the clothes on hangers, generally with no background. But once in a while they’ve got a shot where the clothing is sort of  arranged  to look like a person. Like a flat, handless, footless person with a clothes hanger poking out where their   head should be.
