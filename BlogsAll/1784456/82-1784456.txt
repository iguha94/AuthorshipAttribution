Once christmas has passed it will b easter, then it will b the season of birthdays!!  I am soooo bored its my dad's birthday!  He's getting old the poor dear!  O I'm going out 2night, 2 watch the fireworks and plait Anna's hair, which could be interesting, and then in the morning I am on Perade or at the Village Bash as someone keeps calling it.  They (cadets) have turned round to us and have said that we have 2 wear Bun nets (which i did already) and that we have 2 wear a hair tie that matches our hair colour.  I mean where am i meant 2 get a hair band with blonde, dark brown, and a reddy brown colours on it? This morning I decided to make a cake.  the first one that i have made in our new oven, I used to make Minty cakes in the old oven, but in this one they don't cook properly, and theydont rise they go down!!!  I am not happy with it.  So i watched Telly for a while to make myself feel better, but it diddn't really work so I am telling my feelings to you insted, mayby thats not such a good idea because you will laugh at them.  O well!! Toodles xx O P.S Ne 1 want 2 go out on Monday??? Cos I do!! :P
