Yeah Dude, where's my car? rocks! that is the best movie! American Pie was just err... ever so slightly none-pointish. I mean, wow, it's a film about people losing their virginity praise be to the film. (Yeah - right) Mmm... I don't think the WSL's would get Dude, where's my car? it's our type of humor (teach me how to spell god please do!) and as I've said a million gazillion times, some people (most people) don't get it at all. Go Izzy, you write a sad story go you! I'm wrighting one about this guy who's obsessed with ants... and killing them... He lives in this really old cottage and this lady comes to see him and err wrighters block their! Oh yeah, he's entering this children's book competition thingy. So basically it's a load of crap, but a different type of crap to Izzy's. I seriously don't know where it's going though! Help me! Mmm... but that happens with all my stories. Go Izzy, you actually use paragraphs! :O Shock horror! Hehe, lemme try! Holidays: A time for sitting round and doing nothing, me arranging get togethers, ice-lollies, spending time with your family (which can some times drive you crazy) and a time for taking over the world. But then again, every season is a time for taking over the world! Well, for me it is! Hey, should I be the threee headed monkey? (Damn, forgot how to spell be. Aaargh, that's right you dim-wit! Oops!) Hmm... I'll go arrange assasinations with Mango.
