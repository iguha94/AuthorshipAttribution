I am totaly agreeing Katie!  All some people think about now adays is them selves!  They don't think about what their actions mite do to other people.  They have been brought up in a world where they have always had what they want and when they got it.  To make it simple for blonde peeps (see even im racist about myself) if i was doing what George Bush is doing to the Muslim culture at school this is what it might be like;  Katie beats Lynne up because she ahs pink socks (random thing i no) Lynne thinks that this is awful and in return gets all her allies to help her kick the stuffing out of Katies class, because of what one person out of 30 thinks is right!  See people need to be tought to become tollerant of other peoples beliefs and what they do.  If we went round bombing everyone that we haad the weeniest fall out with there would be noone left to bomb!!  Its simple.  Basicly America and England are starting to have a dictated leadership.  There are not enough  conservatives or Lib dems in the house of commons to have a fair argument against the labour Mps, so what labour says goes! Rant over.  I feel really ill.  I am still doing Media studies c/w and have been since 1/2 9 so i thought i needed a brake!!  (Suprisingly) I really cant think of anything else to say, so its back to my c/w!!! Toodles xx
