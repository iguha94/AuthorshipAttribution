Ahh sorry guys... I'm so clumsy, I lost the post! Yup, clever but clumsy. *sometimes people get those mixed up* I hate being clumsy though! One mistake and things can go wrong, the repercusions. Don't worry, I try at school, but at home I let it all hang out. Sadly, I end up walking into door frames because of this slight 'technical error' - arms mainly, they're annoying. Mmm... slightly ever so slightly changing the subject... don't you just love hearing about other people's trails of thought? Like how you get from crackers to elephants. Err, actually that would be quite hard! I'd probably do crackers - wallace + gromet - moon - cheese - mouse - elephant. Watching tv. Bratz adverts. Feel like killing makers of Barbie. Damn stereotyped ultimate women - big boobs, completely ditzy and 'available'. Real ultimate women - friendly, lovable, UGLY! Who care if you've got a texan zit on your eye! I hate this stupid programme on Sky 1 *don't worry, it's american* about this women trying to find her ultimate date, by meeting them, but they've got masks on, and her they unmasking her 'chosen one' (yup, it's star warrrs!) then if he's ugly, dumping him. *breathhheeee...* How damn stupid is that! If I find my ultimate man to be 'ugly' I think I might kick everyones stereotyped backsides and burn every diet book, and glossy magasine in sight! Infact... I'm gonna do it anyway! Death to Barbie! *note to self: search for anti-barbie website. not to self: join it.*
