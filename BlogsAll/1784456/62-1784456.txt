Heeeey welcome to the pink world. We all live in our own worlds, if you think about it! Well I do... inside my head! Okay, okay, I need help! We do, it's just hard to become a part of some one's world. (What are you thinking? Split personalities or plain madness?) Plain madness I didn't know you could get that! Mmm... I'm probably spelling that wrong but oh well! I think people get freaked out cause I'm so open with my thoughts (well some of them, I tend to leave out the murdering the WSL's). Hehe, but no one's open with their thoughts! Mmm... I'm rambling now aren't I? Ok, so big meeting on Saturday and any one can come! I reeealy don't care! I don't want people to feel left out. Owchie, my ancle kills! I put Emma's 4 inch high shoes on that are too small any way and I fell over pretty badly! Oh well... owchiiieee! Mmm, but I'll live! I think... Hmm we should get Ben C to hang with us if he's got no one. It's bad cause he was walking around on his own. No one should be on their own! Sorry, it's Katie's theory in life: Be nice to people and they will be nice to you. I kind of know what it's like to be on your own and it's not very nice! If only some one would reach out to those people! Ok, bit too moral? Maybe! I'll go muck around with sending Laura files be back!
