*Yawn* Eugh, so tired! I woke up at half eight today ...don't ask why. I have to go out at about 10:40 though so I can meet people ...zzz. Don't really know if getting up that early is worth it. I missed out on a whole lot of beauty sleep. About the kitchen, we were gonna have liner or whatever on the floor but to do that you had to rip up the old stuff and scree...? And that would cost a bomb. Then the guy showed us some expensive carpet and I was like "Eh, yeah right we're gonna have that." So then he showed us these bits of wood you clip together. Dad was thinking about doing it *shiver* at this rate who needs a new floor? My mum likes this really really bad wallpaper and I like the good one (it's always the way) Hehe, I got my brother on my side. Don't ask me where Izzy is, I think she's disappeared off the side of the Earth. She's neglecting the blog! :O It's awful! Oh my God, the world is ending. Oh my God, the world is nigh. (Stupid song, the less questions asked the better) Oh, my mum keeps going on about this thing in bond. This guy says to M "I don't think you have the balls for this job" and M says "At least I don't have to think with them all the time." Hehe, it has all this really played down weird stuff in it! Cool!
