HEEEY! I'm BAAACK!!! *from Prague...) ^_^; Uhh... yeah... Well, it was really fun! (I can't believe Cardiff was the hottest place in Europe on Thursday!) Prague is really nice... it's full of Baroque buildings and all the architecture *just pretend that's readable* was amazing! It was even kind of hot! *yeay!* Only bad bit was me on the plane back, my ear was completely gunked up with wax so when we landed it absolutly killed ^_^* (still does!) So now I'm deaf in my right ear! YEAY! And then it hurt to breathe when I was trying to go to sleep *at home* so I kind of woke my mum up and fainted... then it was alright! So if I just forget about the last bit of Thursday, it was great! Is it Friday...? Ahh! So it is! Ahh.. only had about 70 bits of spam floating around in my soup, so that's alright! Any way... Prague. It's Czech Republic's capital! (That took about five minutes to work out how to spell it... I'm tired ok!) It was really amazing because it was full of so many different nationalities, there were French, Spanish, German, Dutch, English and Czech people! And Prague was covered in amazing stuff! *slightly in awe* Ahh... and I loved Charles Bridge. It was covered in amazing statues, and had people playing music all along it (and shops *teehee*) I got this cool fish bracelet from there! We heard a load of jazz, it was really cool! It was actually a really cultural place... hmm... I think I  am  crazy. I really need to stop talking to myself/brick walls. Which one's worst? I've been having one of those 'oh crap i'm so stupid' days, you know? Like when you think about things that have happened and realised that some stuff completely went over the top of your head! I hate that! Hmm.. soluble fish. Cool eh?
