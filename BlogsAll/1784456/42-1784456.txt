  Heloooooooo! I'm a bit confused now, doesn't take a lot! I went on a watching tv thing today, I watched Yu-Gi-Oh and it was all speechy and we're all friends and I'm even more confused, like in Saved by the Bell where they all get together at the end and admit how they were all selfish and stuff and it's like forget that! burn the school! Uhuh... Yeah, tiredness? no, wierdness? definatly. I've been doing reading too at   http://www.fanfiction.net  cause I'm really bored and I need some thing to do! Oh, we're gonna go get Amelie (shoot me for trying to spell it) yeay! (I need to watch a film!) Plus popcorn, which Izzy is a bit obsessed with. Oh! Big news! They aren't gonna do any new Ally Mcbeal's cause the ratings are dropping in america! :( :( :( They dropped Due South cause of that too! Grr... *mumbles* but, Calista (shoot me twise why don't you) Flockheart (Ally (oh, just shoot!)) Is a bit thin, ok so she's like a stick! They were saying in the paper that they all have eating problems or some thing... In my opinion they should drop Friends and keep Ally! (Yeay!) But... they're still showing Eastenders so maybe I'm losing on the tv thing. Yeah, yesterdays was overdramaticly funny! The actors are sooo rubbish! (The jury were!) They found her guilty! :O Have I got News for You was reallly good! I laugh out loud at that programme, which is kind of rare. Do you say lol and lol? I don't! See, wierdness. I'm gonna go mope cause no one else is blogging! Bubi!
