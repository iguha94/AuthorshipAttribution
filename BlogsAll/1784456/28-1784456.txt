Wow! Laura was on! And Fox Kids doesn't suck! Hmm... Well. What to blab about? Oh yeah...there's this girl at school. Let's call her Blob. Okay so now this isn't gonna sound serious it's gonna sound cheese and tacky! But anyway... I think she got bullied at her last school and she told us she ran away. She was laughing about it yesterday but today she started crying. She wouldn't tell any one what was wrong and didn't want to talk about it, if you tried she would just walk away and I don't know what to do! If she wants to be left alone shouldn't we just leave her alone? But every one needs to talk to people. It's better to do that. She kind of stood there and cried... Help any one? I don't think we should force her to tell us. Just be around for her. But she's new and we don't really know her so she might not think that she can rely on us that much. If we force it out of her it might make it worse. She needs to talk to her parents about it other wise she might do some thing stupid. Maybe they're part of the problem so maybe she shouldn't. Maybe she should talk to the school councillor but maybe she doesn't want to and won't say any thing any way. Sorry but that's what's going round my head. I just don't know how to help her. This is true. I don't know how to help Blob. (Hehe that sounds stupid!) SERIOUS. (Whoops, sorry!) How can you talk to some one that keeps walking away? I think she thought that moving school would make all her problems go away. Nothing can do that apart from yourself. Hmm. If you have a good idea then e-mail me where it says contact by the bloghome thingy! Well, sorry to make you depressed have a nice day and remember where ever you are or who ever you are we are all lucky.
