Any way I'm normal now 'horrah!' Is that how you spell horrah? It's kind of tacky, and I don't know why I used it. Oh and no English people use it, we're not like the tv, we're like the microwave. What was I saying about normal? Oh well, guess I'm having a weird year, maybe even a weird life. But wouldn't that make it a normal life for me if I did it over and over again? (the weirdness) Wooh! I'm making people's brains tick! When I say people's every one knows I mean Izzy's. Look down the blog page and see how many entries are Izzy's. 1 : 20000000000000000000 (Izzy's the 1) Oh wow, it's a ratio, go on Izzy, work it out *shiver* Stupid maths teacher. Oh I'm going to a happy 85th Birthday party for mm Great-Aunt! And I'm saying oh too much. Guess I'm happy cause I'm about to go Christmas shopping! Yes, yes, I know, Christmas is ages away. Tell my nutty Aunt that! She likes to get Christmas presents arranged months before hand, otherwise she nags you. (It's a fun kind of life isn't it?) Seeing as all the Christmas presents are around at this time, we have to go. On my list is: cool fire shoes! (That's right, burn me alive.) And a cool Quicksilver coat! Wow! Hey I just noticed I do (that) too much! It's just what the inside of my head is doing! (Not much) Or it's me talking to myself...you figure it out... (Yes Katie, I will)
