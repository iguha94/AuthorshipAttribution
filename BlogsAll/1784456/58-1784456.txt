Yeay! You get £1,000 out of this best british web blog thingy if you win... Errr... yeah like we'll win! Hehe, oh sorry about lack of blogging but I've actually been doing things! :O No, no, don't worry, I don't have a life. (Phew, getting worried their!) Heey! Oh well. We went to Laura's house today. We = me, Lynne and Izzy. We went and played rounders in the park and with my great hitting skills I won, of course. :P (Yeah right!) Then Laura's next door neighbours we're being... freaky... They said "You're gay" So Lynne and Izzy were like hugging each other and going "Yeah we are." I got a tiny winy bit scared! Then one of them said "Gregory (or whoever the sad little kid was) fancies you." So I said "Sorry, we're gay." Ok, so it was funny at the time! What else... oh yeah, obsessive swinging and then I found out the swing gave me black marks on my legs! Eeek! And we freaked this young kid out, nah, we didn't. We were overly "Oh, hi, so what's you name?" Ya know? Yeah... sure... We watched Never Been Kissed for like the millionth time and Lynne cried! We also did some Pop dancing with Lizzie Web. *cringe* That was bad! Every one was going on about how they've had deep and meaningful discussions about the WSL's with their parents - so have I! Mmm... scary. Hehe, I might go on freaky mode tomorrow and totally freak every one out! We've got two days of school left! Noooooooooo! :'( All we'll do is watch videos, so it's ok I guess. Still a bit of a bummer. I'll bring Galaxy Quest (yeay!), The Road to El Dorado (YEAY!) and the Twelve Monkeys to make me look serious (Next to impossible!) Every one bring things! Yeay! Play pinyata? Ok, so I'm going weird, sorry that popped into my head! Mmm... barbeque... follow the smell... I'll be going now bubi!
