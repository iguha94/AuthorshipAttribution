Just thinking about the Halloween thingy we're gonna do...wanna go trash the school? Hehehe. No, really. Wooohoooo! We've got no school on Monday! Wooooo! Wow, just sunk in. Oh god, you know some one who has a voice that drags on and it's like shut up?! (Just pretend you do!) Well any way umm it's got some one like that on the radio...why am I listening to the radio? Oh no, no NO! I'm listening to country and western radio! I'll just go break it...be right back... You'll now be happy to know that it's stopped. Any way are we gonna have a Halloween party? Oh and are we going to go trick or treating? My parents give out scabby treats, but no one ever comes round...the way I see it is if they get nice stuff and no one comes I get it! Ohh...I feel sick...hmm maybe it's because I've been on the playstation for ages? I was trying to destroy this boss and I tried three times! All adding up to about an hour! Then I finally defeated him (yeay!) and he unleashed this attack after he died...and I died too...Grr! Hey Laura, you a skin head then or what? Oh I'm sorry Izzy, giving me and Laura site exposure (clever huh?) I'll add your site to the links bit *sigh* Hey! Does our expage thingys still work? Do me a favour Izzy and go check! Oh and can some one please blog! Cause at the moment I keep talking to myself...and although I'm the head of freaks there aren't any freaks online! :( Boohoo, all alone. Any way can you think up a sub-title thingy cause I put it as 'Can it' cause I was in a bad mood...ehe...so umm any better ones? Oh and maybe I could muck around with the HTML and make our website...PINK! I'll try, might make me sick though. Have a fundidileoodle day!
