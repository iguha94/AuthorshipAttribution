Wow! I'm back! Geez yeah, my brother's been on all day! Grr... Thanks to the girl with no name... yeaaaah! I've gone all creative! ..Wow... my parents are going out, hmm what to do? (*evil laugh*) Ahaaah! Be afraid, I'm having a mad creative moment but erm sadly I used it all up on my essay. :( Sad huh, yeah! Oh, and the bird died, and Mango got another one today plus another shrew thing! He's a murderer! It is pretty awful but then again it is natural (yep still creative and motionlessly droning) wow, is that a real word? Isn't it droaning? Hmm, I dunno. (Grrr) Ooook, so I'm really scared cause I'm listening to a really really scary song... eeek! Sorry, I have this up for about half an hour before I actually post it! Ahh... I pressed stop, so much better! How cool, I'm reading a story and it has 1. Defult Chapter 2. Chapter 2 3. The chapter after chapter 2. I mean, wow, I am going a bit wierd aren't I? Ohhh, we had this cool idea for a after SATs party (shoot us we're bored) and we could do a pinyatata! (pinyata shoot me too I can't spell it!) Can any one? Any way, we were gonna make one of those big things that you hit, uhuh, (?) and we were gonna make it look like a teacher so we could whack it! (Hmm I could see myself getting a little bit too excited) and we could either put cool stuff in it (FOOD!) or fill it with water ballons because... I care about this world (really moving music) sorry I'm stuck in the movies. I always say that, wouldn't that be perfect in a movie. Yup, wierd as hell. I better go record Star Trek for my mum otherwise I won't be here tomorrow! Bubi!
