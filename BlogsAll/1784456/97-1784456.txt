Isn't it amazing what a game of Tony Hawks PS2 skateboarding against your brother can do? (Ahh, don't worry, you'll have to read that about four times to figure out that it's actually metaphorical for: I want to eat your chocolate cake.) Mmm... but yeah, having people care can solve anything! (But chocolate solves more) Back vile stoumach! Ew... have you washed recently? A bit of acid's leaking... (Oh that, hehe, that's nothing.) Oh wait... YAAARGHHH! And yes, I'm board. WOOHOO! It's ... Tuesday ... Did anything interesting ever happen on Tuesday? Apart from the whole apocolypse... now that would make Tuesday more interesting! Now for something less random...   I'm a Philosopher/Scientist!

Take More of Robert & Tim's Quizzes    Watch Robert & Tim's Cartoons     Ok, ok, I didn't say how less random it was! *sorry* Just had the whole atheist / theist / agnostic thing today.

I think I'll stick with being an atheist thank you very much. Now take your lemon and leave!
