Flods. Oh great. It's a purple monkey! My brother went all out and downloaded BonziBUDDY and oooh baby isn't it bad. It kind of makes you wanna punch it. Weirdest voice in the world. Wow. These people get a thrill out of making a CBBC website. Hehe, chat about there new look, no seriously do they think eight year olds would want to watch this programme? What am I doing watching it any way? Oh yeah, Neighbours is on. Good, America's sleeping. That means the nets not busy! Is America sleeping? Oh and Izzy, I missed Flint the Time Detective! I'm sorry! Oh and you know every one says we're hippies. Well I don't know about Izzy but I'm closer to a jitter. (Jitter? Gitter?) Hehe. We should go to a party (if we ever get invited to one) and be hippies! Just to overly piss them off. We're not hippies though. They're just judging us by what we wear. Hmm...wonder if you can punch the monkey. Oh and about walking home...! Well my brother started shouting at me but I thought he was shouting at some one else so he legged it down the field! Hehe. Prettttty quickly as well! Yeay! If my knee keeps this up then the growing pains will stop me from doing cross-country (Oh-no I really care) Well at least it's not affecting my weight...Is it?! Aargh! Oh great force fead carrots... Umm any one want to come round my house every day and eat carrots? Didn't think so. Hey I'll try to post Izzy on this with HTML! And she won't be able to...muhaha! Live long and eat carrots.
