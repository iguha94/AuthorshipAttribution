I'll tell you about the mad man now, it's a psychological crappy thing basically. You have been warned!  Why do people go to the loo with some one else. It's cause they might be attacked! (Remember this is me, it's stupid) But by who? The mad man in the loo! So if you're gonna be attacked if you go to the girls loos then you should go to the boys loos. (I bet I'm spelling loos wrong! Loo's nope, oh well) But if you go to the boys loos you are the mad woman cause you're going to the boys loos! Stupid aye! And the point being... *sob sob* I just found out that my mum washed my hoodie. :( (YOU'VE NEVER HAD IT WASHED?) Nope! It felt so soft not washed! :'( (Eww... *takes a step back* DAMN! I'm attached to this body help!) Hehehe... err yeah. So any way, every one knows the coma thingy too? Nope? Good, good, thanks for the card Laura! That is soooo cool! My dad took one of my draws out of my wardrobe and he 'fixed' it and it won't go back in! So all my pants are all over my room! Yeaaah sure you wanted to know that, just warning you if you come over. Mmm... tea time, yeah, yeah, I'm gonna blog again! Some people have been bitchy and I need to tell people what I think. Hmm, I do that way too often don't I? Some times the things that I think are way to weird. *eerie silence* Ok then bibi!
