Hi. Today's been fun. Oh and if you're wondering, I rampaged home ;) Also I've been informed that admazed is actually amazed (Even though I didn't notice the difference) Hey, I can be admazed if I want to! Oh and my knees hurt. A lot! It seems to hurt walking up and downstairs and bending down, so I've given up bending down and I'm letting Izzy do it for me! Laura (my other friend) has a pain in her knee too! So we walk around like a couple of old lady's; all ways complaining about our knees. The class dork asked Laura out. To my  admazement  (well I've got to find a new way to annoy Izzy) she said no! Hehe, well he was a sexist pig and his ego was about as big as his stupidness (very big). Ahh, tomorrow's Friday and  admazingly  I got invited to a party! Wow! So I'm going to Laura's because my house is here   and it takes me about 40 mins to get waaayyyyy over there! But Emma (the girl's party) is fun! I hope she likes what I got her. Claire (other girl) is a bit too odviously saying 'Oh I have to go at 8 because I have to go to gym. Yes that's right at 8 after the sleep over." Way to rub in that we're not coming. She shoots and she scores! (Right between the eyes on her hopefully) Hehe this is fun! Well I better go and see what the kittens have done now because they're bound to of done something. They're never dull and very  admazing !
