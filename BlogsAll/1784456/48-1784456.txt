Oooh the page doesn't load. :( :( :( Floopers to the page! Whatever that means! Thank youuuuuuuu Flora! Heeey Oakhampton! Yeay! Don't worry we'll be back on Friday, although we'll probably all be zoned out so see ya on Saturday I guess. Is every one taking gross gross clothes? Cause I am and I don't wanna be the only one! Eeek! Save me! I'm taking a looooad of food so we won't go starving.. just a bit starving! I've never been on an adventure holiday before so it should be fun... yeah that is if no one drowns. Ok, ok, stop panicing! Hey I haven't even started! Hehe... scary... Uhuh, so any way my Dad's kicking me off. :P He's got all of next week to go on with no one bothering to bother him. *sigh* We went to Nargiza's leaving do, it was waaaaaaay formal, it was all these people from this church. Oh, but we got free food so hey. All the people round our age seemed to be blonde... all of them were quite scary really! But then this old lady started talking to us and I was like uhuh, so I let Izzy do all the talking, how nice huh? Mmm... better go see you guys in a blue moon, or a pink one which ever one comes on Saturday reallly. Go check out Mr Fopple and muck around on   http://www.flasharcade.com  If you're bored kiddies. Ok, bubi! *sob sob* Reeeealy have to go (and learn to spell) yeah, but that'll take longer. :| BYEEEEEEEEE!
