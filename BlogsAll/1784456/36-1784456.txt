Life is about assumptions. We assume that we are going to be alive tomorrow, that our family and friends will be and we assume that we will eat. What happens when these assumptions disappear? What if we didn't know who would be alive or dead tommorow, is this the beginning of worrying and fear? (EH? Katie, what are you going on about?) Sorry, just testing out how deep I can go and how good my essay skills were. (*rubbish*) Yeah, I know! Just trying to make people think I guess. (People? What people?) Hmm... Ok, the other thing I was thinking about (well one out of about five thousand random thoughts inside my head) well it's that my Dad's a manager of a NHS hospital. Sure, every one's knocking down the NHS saying how rubbish it is, but in America if you don't have the cover for a operation you might not get it, you don't get the same care and people have to ask your insurers whether they can save your life or not. Hmm... This isn't like my moral mode. Well, I guess it is... I'm thinking about too much so I need to throw some stuff out to leave room for more stuff! (Eehhhhee... CRAZY) Badaboombadabing! I'm gonna go watch TV! Oh at school...hmm, nothing happened apart from this deep and meaningful play... aargh! they've achieved their goal and reached me! Noooo! They're one step closer to world domonation! (As I said, crazy, you really should of left it afer the deep and meaningful crap about assumptions) I agree.
