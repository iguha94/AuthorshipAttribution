Msn doesn't work. It's official. It doesn't like my computer! Hehe, I took the bus to piano so I didn't have to walk! Heeehee! Oh and Laura went in the wrong room (!) (stupid Laura!) she walked round like a complete idiot for a bit and I stood outside thinking like a complete idiot. My tiny little brain couldn't cope with the fact that stupendously clever Laura had walked into the wrong room. Either that or it was trying to think that I had and that would be even more confusing. So I dragged her out and about 3 hours later she was still babbling on about it! She seems to have a thing about that (a very stupid thing, but still, it's Laura's thing!) Oh and I got home by car so I didn't walk home :( I'm sorry! Wow, what a boring day! Oh and every one thinks we're hippies...yep...they're weird. My kittens don't seem to like the rain! They like to stay indoors which is really very clever because Scamp used to go outside anyway. Oh and Brodie's official count for falling in the pond is now: 2. Keep you updated on that every day because stupid Brodie falls in about every day! Oh and aww! We have pictures of them! I might be able to put some html in and take a picture of them and put it on this! (Wow, she's actually that clever?!) Nope, but I like you to think that I am! :) Is it me or am I just talking to myself...yup and Izzy isn't even listening. AM I ALONE? HELOO?
