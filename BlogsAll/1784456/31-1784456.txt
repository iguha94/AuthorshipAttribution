Mmm. Me again. Well I only type one blog a day cause nothing interesting happens to me! It's cause we've got no school, no one's doing any thing stupid so there's nothing to type about! Oh, apart from I turned my chocobo blue! But hey, who wants to know that? And what sort of a name is Choco for a chocobo?! Oh, also we found well I found that we still have a fish in our pond! :O Shock! Geez, that's blummin' admazing! (Doesn't admazing sound soooo much better than amazing?!) I went on some one's blog and they were going on like they're the only brits that use blogger! Heloo! Any way they kept going on about being brits and I was like ok...I'm going now... They were from Bristol too, but I was too freaked by then! See! I need other people to talk! I'm gonna go crazy! Aparantly (I'm sure that's got one e in at least but what do I know?) another.co.uk costs money to get now! But I signed up when they were free so they're being nice to me... or they haven't figured that I'm not paying. I really can't be bothered to pay for stuff on the net. Why fork out the money for a domain when you can get free ones? Do you think so people need to expand their ego or some thing? Hmm. Maybe they just spend too much time on the net. (Well hey, I can't be bothered to pay for one.) Yeah, spending way too much time on the net is me! Why is it that I have like 50 people on my Msn list and the most boring people decide to come on? Ehe. I better go cause I need to do some thing...
