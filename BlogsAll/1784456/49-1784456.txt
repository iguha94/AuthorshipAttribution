That was sooo fun! Sorry Laura, I just wanted to go! We got a load of strange people to talk to us and muck around! Oh yeah, then we kind of attacked people with water. :D I think Laura has some thing against capital letters! Hehe Kim got so covered in water today, she got totally soaked and her hair got all wet! No one stopped throwing water at her and people went away and refilled their bottles and came back! Hehe, then she rubbed her hair on us and her hair dye came out on our clothes! Meanie Kim! But it was fun cause we got loads of people, and we got a load of people to join in with drenching Kim and people talked to us. Ok, so the point being: we joined all the 'loners' into one big group of 'loners' making us the sad group! YEAY! I like being nice to people what's the point in being horrible? Mmm... Yeay Bristol's gonna be fun! Woohoo we have our strange group ready and we can go buy plastic swords and freak every one out! Fun! Oooh sorry about the nicking your shoes thing Laura... but it was fun! Hehe and we took Izzy's as well! You actually got them back in the end though, well err after about half an hour of pratting about! Yeah I guess Tasha was supposed to do the high jump, PROUD TO BE LAST IN SPORTS DAY! Damn it we're good! My plan in life is not to shut people out but to let people in, in my opinion any one can be my friend and join our little 'gang' and I always want to eb that way. I will never be picky about my friends and I will always welcome friendship! (Moral rant over, you can breathe now).
