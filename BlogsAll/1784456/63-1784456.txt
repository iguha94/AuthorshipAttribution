Wow 7 people love this blog. What kind of web sites do YOU go on?!?!? Hehe, just kidding a bit zany right now cause I was playing on Silent Hill 2 and getting freaked out... My brothers friend left it here and I didn't have the box or any thing so I basically didn't know shit about it and was totally weirded out. (Kind of like what you're feeling now) :P Uhuh... hmm need to find a new freak out site cause this one's getting old! Hehe, gotta love the kick ass pink... ok, so you don't have to! Mmm... seriously needing to get out more! How dumb do some people think we are? Ok so I can't talk seeing as I recently took that test saying you're dumb as shit... but any way. Shits quite clever really it err can err smell... more than Laura, now that's not good but it's hard to do! :D Uhuh... lack of blogging getting to me! (More like lack of socializing) Now that's not trueee I had to spend a whole week with Izzy that was bad! I kept hearing things at night... hmm lack of sleep halucinating again? ...Probably! So better go take of the world *sigh* again. I'm too nice really to keep doing this job, killing just doesn't have the same zing now. I'm scared too don't worry I need to go to sleeeep.Ok, so I'm gonna go downstairs and watch Pride and Prejudice (geez you're weird) yeah I am so bubi guys! Tricky - You don't wanna, weirdest song in the whole world. Kind of disco techno jargon yeay! *kicks me out* Good! Bi!
