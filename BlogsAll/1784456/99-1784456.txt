Ahh... slightly been neglecting this! Sorry! Just been kind of lonely, which makes a bored non bothering me. Woohoo! Also, I've been wondering what the deal is with the obsession that teenage mags have with people farting? Seriously! *no, seriously* It's really quite weird, and it's not like you can not fart! (Hands up who've tried) Yeay, now I'm talking about farts and you've freaked out yourself / the neighbours / your goldfish! Woohoo! Yes, I really can get around to talking about anything. Ahh, but I've mellowed out a bit, which isn't good! (Hmm...) Other excuses: I was eaten by aliens. I am an alien. The dog ate it. (Wait a sec, I don't have a dog!) Noooo! Ah, I could try my brother ate it, he tried to eat my English book once! Ah, actual excuse: I've got mocks next week! AAAHHHH! These are mocks, not mock mocks, which makes them confusingly kind of important *i'm gonna wing it like i always do* Yeay! Oh, and I've got... wait a sec, new excuse... I've got a concert today! I get to HIT a BASS DRUM! Now, that's something to be proud of! It is kind of hard though, you have to count the bars, and when you end up going 43 2 3 4 44 2 3 4 you get  a bit lost! I'm always one beat out! *oops* Yup, I mess up the whole thing, YEAY! Ahh it'll be fine though, like everything else *ignorance is bliss*
