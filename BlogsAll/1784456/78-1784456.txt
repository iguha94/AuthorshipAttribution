Yeay! Bloggers back! *hugs my page* What would I do without you? (Probably end up writing trashy books) Hey! *sniff sniff* Don't leave me like that again! You hear me! (You're talking to a webpage...) MY webpage! Any way... oops, our webpage! *just plugged in* Any way! School's out! Yeay!   http://www.anorak.co.uk/news_161245.shtml  It's funny! The dumb stuff that newspapers come up with... Any way, back to small point that's probably floating around here some where... hmm... oh here it is. I went on   ebay  and err... how to put it. Went a bit FY obsessed! Some of the stuff is really cheap! *eerie silence* Come on guys! FY!!! (Fushigi Yuugi for all you uneducated non-manga lovers) Oh... I was trying to do CCS again. Aargh how hard is that! I mean, they could at least give you some hint as to what these tags do! How do I get the text to the right of the picture? I don't have any idea! I'll probably end up chopping it up again... *zzz* Fun... nope. I try to find out how to do it, but every one's grumpy and like 'Well no one helped me learn it so bugger you' to put it basically. Nice huh? But then if no one helps any one it'll just keep going around in a messy circle! Woohoo! Blood! Guts! YEAH! *ahem* Any way... the point? Here pointy pointy point. Oh yeah, I'll just throw some thing together and make every one go 'wow, and it took you that long to just do  that? ' And I'll go off going 'rasumfrasum' like I do. OK! Hey! I'm not depresssed! Just deep! Ok... so depresssed has three s's *how do you do that?* now! Yeah! I'll go back to my hole now... first I'll turn off the bathroom light, every one leaves it on for a weird reason...
