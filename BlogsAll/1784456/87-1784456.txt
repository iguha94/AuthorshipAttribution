Ok is AND that short litytle kid that i was laughing at?  If it is or was (im confused) then I know who the heck he is.  If not I have no idea who u r on about!  Kes I am v. insulted that u 1/2 destroyed my blog:(  O well forgive and forget is the best thing to live by. Laura I have to totally agree with you.  i am gonna get all deep now and probably regret it but who gives a monkeys?  I think that the reason that people take drugs drink alchol etc etc is because through that they feel young again and they feel like they dont have a care in the world; they dont think about how that if they were not in the state that the were that if they jumped from the top of the stairs they would kill themselves.  I dont think that, that made any sence.  Basically the point I am trying to get at is that people now adays just grow up to darn quickly.  They start to think about to complex things at an early age.  I feel that schools are partly to blame for this because they expect little kids to know to much.  I have two things to prove this. My first day at Nailsea school, so I was just 11 years old.  Mrs Smith tells Leigh of for being to childish.  For goodness sake, thats because at the age of 11 you are still a child!  Or to me you are anyway.  The other thing was one of my first h/w's at Nailsea school was what is the meaning of life?  How was i ment to know that?  I was 11 for flips sake.  sorry if it seems that i have been ranting on for no reason what so ever, but i feel very strongly about things like that! New thing I wonder how sponge Bob square bum is? Toodles xx
