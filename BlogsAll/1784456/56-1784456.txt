Yeah Rosie is seriously weird - I don't mean fun-kinda-weird like us...just...weird! WOOHOO! Holiday time! A time of sun, ice-lollies and most importantly...plastic sword-fights!!  I've decided to write a story/book or something (just nod) about this eccentric wannabe writer (say nothing) who decides she's going to publish a diary of her living in all these different places, like a muddy hole six feet underground, on a house roof, on a shack in the middle of the sea etc, and its gonna be called - "Life in a Hole and other stories" Sad huh? With quotes like - "I can now fully empathise with an earthworm" and "I managed to forget my diary, so I have spent the last few days constructing writing materials out of mud" and "I think I've spent too much time around the birds on this tweet-tweet roof and I tweet-tweee-twee a nice little tweet so I just had to tweet-tweeee!" I know its crap, but its my crap goddammit!  Anyway, American Pie was soooo rubbish! I laughed once or twice, but not exactly out loud. It was just a load of sad popularity-crazed guys trying to get laid to impress eachother, and treating these girls like shit! And Rosie and Lisa were like - "Oh it's soooo funny! "Dude, where's my car is soooo crap!" " Excuse me, but phsyco-ostriches, dumb teenagers, a stoner dog, a derranged chinese food restuarant assistant, swedish/welsh aliens and a load of really really funny gags equals one hell of a shibby-sweet movie, dude!
