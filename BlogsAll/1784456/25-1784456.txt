8.30? Wow ...you all night party girl *cough* Hello! Finally I can free you from Izzy! Oh, great, my brother put on some really sad music so if I go all depressed send my brother hate mail. ;) Some wierd people have added me on msn and it's quite scary. Oh, the kitchens fitted! Woohoo! And my dad's wall papering at the moment. I think I'll stay up here! Oh great, hw to do. Like I've done any. Oh we got the kittens back! (Have I said that already?) My mum's up in Peterborough, or however you spell it with my Grandpa. Hmm, no, there are some things you shouldn't say. Is it just me or is every one cold? My fingers are going numb. Oh, about the shoes! I put a £10 deposit on them! Woohoo! I'm actually getting them! One bad thing though. When I came out of the shop I err kind of had a bit of a blister. That might of been because I tried four pairs of shoes on... (I like being difficult!) I even tried on the mens size nine! Hehe. Hey, I'm not as sad as you think, they're skate shoes! Made by Buffalo! The only thing now is to wonder if the shoes give me blisters ...hmm! Well we all have to suffer for fashion, do we? My Dad's dragging me into Bristol to go shopping and have breakfast in Bristol! Arggggh! So tired, hmm, guess I better get on with the hw. :( Pink is the colour of the world! (Or should be)
