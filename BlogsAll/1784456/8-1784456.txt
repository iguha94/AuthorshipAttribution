What's scary about my life. 1. I don't actually have a life, it's a illusion that some small genetically modified lamposts made up to keep themselves interesting during their summer break from school. 2. I'm tryping this, proving Izzy's theory about us being mad true. 3. Izzy keeps mentioning the fact that her five year old brother 'fancies' me and Izzy's going to have her face rearranged. Remember Izzy I have a lot of dirt on you! (All I'm saying is a pillow and someone called Sam G...) 4. Chris keeps jumping on my bad and not getting spiked by my spikes. (That was the whole purpose of me having spikes on my bag.) 5. The thought that we have no control over our lives, what happens, happens . Fate it fate. (Don't dempt fate, especially with green candy floss. 6. Yes, Jason the oogly-boogly weird eyed person is scary! BUT HE FANCIES IZZY!  So ha! (And I'm not going to let that go either...hehe.) 7. David the other scary person who hangs round with us. What's even more scary is Emma likes him. Oh about the pink flares. No. We don't get embarrassed... Oh Laura. Astro poo has been the word of the year! Erm tell your Mum to give us worms! Hehe, I'm gonna go do what I do best. Muck up   this website!  Scary no. 8.
