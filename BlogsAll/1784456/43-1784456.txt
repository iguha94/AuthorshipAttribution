What the? I think my hotmail's gone a bit funny, it says I'm almost out of extra storage space so I went on a deleting spree and it hasn't changed! Err, any one wanna buy me some extra storage space? :| Wow, kind of duck like. Aww, poor Emma really hurt her arm and leg and every one got back from Spain! (yeay!) Herum. I think the red storage bar just went up!? Queer! Oh and say herum, it's not a actual word. Oh, and Izzy found a wierd and wonderful list of our words that we've made up! (cool!) Izzy, you have to put them on this! Hmm, is Becki coming on? She hasn't so far and I need more blogging people! Hmm... wierd, I just got a e-mail about submitting this to a load of sites for money? Do we want people to purposely come on this? No, I'ld rather they'ld trip over this! (What's with the 'ld) And as many times as people would search for saneasakitten, I think I'm alright! ;) Hmm... maybe that's what was taking up all the space! (hope so otherwise you're doomed!) Mmm... I feel a sudden Monkey Island urge, even though I'm stuck! I can't find the fort on Monkey Island! Can some one help me out, yeah I'm a bit fo a dingbat I know! (wow, dingbats are cool!) Hmm... we should all sing more! (You're just plain mad) Is there a plain mad, and how come if I'm a three headed monkey I only have two heads... (the other one's asleep look to you're left) AAARGH! (Don't ask!)
