Heeeey! So err great I'm actually on this! (It was being annoying, like my brother :P) Heeey! My Aunty and peeps from America are coming in a bit! (I mean ageeees!) But it's when I'll be at Oakhampton... :( But they'll be here for four weeks so I'll get to see them! ...yeah... Oh if you're wondering about the insane number of links to nowhere then uhh it's because my favourites on the net is getting really big and I need room to expand so I'm using this! Hehehe! I usually go on link trails any way so it kind of helps! Oh and I found out (well remembered) that if you're on a nice layoutee site press F11 and it'll make the page fill the whole screen! Then press F11 to get out of it...I've done it before by accident and got kind of stuck! But err...you're cleverer than me...right? :(((( Every one's going on about FF10 and I don't even have a PS2! *sob sob* hmm you should see how long my amazon.co.uk wish list is! Hehehe... I probably shouldn't go into that by I love amazon! Hehe, I'm let loose with my Dad's credit card! Muhahahahaaa! (Don't you recon if we do a play of Macbeth we should turn to look at the camera and do this really deep Muhahaha! That would be really... really... funny!) Don't worry, I can picture it in my head... Oh, is that before or after we take over the world? Comments any one?
