Any way heloooo! I just got a bit freaked in music, some one told me that Jon likes me... Erm. I don't like him like that, only as a friend. Is it that when girls get close to boys they think they like them as boyfriends and not just as friends? Aaaargh this world and social thing is just way tooo confusing! That's why me and Izzy and every one have stayed out of it! Hehe... but seriously, hmm... And doesn't every one get that thing where they think they hear things? I always do so that's why I always ask people what they said. I'm not death! contrary to popular opinion though! Mmm, some one kick me back into sanity! Went a bit mad today... the WSL's came up to us and generally pratted about! Then I kind of shouted 'Bye WSL's' at them and now they're bugging us about what it means. They were being mean in the first place and why should they give a damn!!! Sorry... little bit pissed. These year 8's were kicking balls at us too! So me and Izzy had a plan to scream and run at them, or we could go 'ooga ooga ooga-shaka' and start dancing to freak them out! So I get all fired up and then they come over to us. Why don't they just fuck off? It's not that hard really! We've never done any thing to us but they feel that it's their right to continue to bug us until the end of time. FUCK OFF! Sorry... I might end up punching them next time though. Oh, and why am I apologising? Ok, ok, calm down... I will... some time. Hmm, better go watch tv to calm down... or take my anger out of a fighting game. YEAY! Kill people wooohooo! Wait a minute... it's not real life oh darn. oh well bubi!
