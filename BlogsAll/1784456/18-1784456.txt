sorry i havent been on for so long you see... what happened is this... i was walking along, (well actually i was bouncing along on a purple spacehopper) and SUDDENLY i fell down a hole. But this was not just any old hole, this was the holy hole which lead to a strange and mysterious moose. (moose, izzy?) well yeah i think so. anyway, this moose was so big that it could fit in my pocket! imagine! But it wasnt just any moose, it was the Chocolate mousse moose! It sat down and started to eat - yes you guessed it- a pineapple of course! But then i thought - oh no! i have to get back home soon so that i can go on blogger or else katie will be cross! So, i did what i'm sure you would have done in this situation, i asked the pink moose- ( i thought you said it was a chocolate moose izzy?) Who's telling the story here? for asock to stuff in the top of my pink umberella. (naturally) so that i could skillfully affix the moose's pink pinapple (that he graciously sold to me in exchange for a pink orange) to the handle of the pink umberella to counteract the air reistance. I tied it on using a pink shoelace. But this was not just any pink shoelace... it was the shooing lace which shooed away anything in its path! it shooed so hooingly that i was shooed onto my back and landed on the floor! TO BE CONTINUED (because my mums telling me to come off)
