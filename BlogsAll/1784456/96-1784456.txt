Hmm... should we mean what we say and not say what we mean? I can't remember what way around that goes! It's scary that people don't mean what they say... I know that people do, but does that mean that we should question everything they say and the value of their words? (Yup, about four years of thinking) Ahh... it's scary. Our world's so capitalist. People just want your money. Apparantly it's fine to screw the third world, so long as we benefit. But what if we were born differently. What about the third world? Yeah, they might be poor, but that's through no fault of their own. They could be the next superstar if they were given the chance. I'm willing to bet that if they were where I am they wouldn't be sitting around, they'd be grabbing every oportunity, because they know what it's like to have none. Is life too easy for us? All we have to do is selfishly go to McDonald's, paying 99p for food that's destroying the world around us. Just think for a second, what did they have to do to get the price to 99p? How many people did they rip off? We have the money to pay for fair trade, yet we selfishly keep it to ourselves. All because we were born here. What rights should we have because of birth place? Because of a fusion of egg and sperm we are somehow viewed differently by society and have more prospects. In this world money is all that matters. Only people who have too much of it do good with it. Why do we refuse to spread money equally, giving everyone a fair chance to eat and grow? Why do people die from obseity when others die from famine? Why can't I stop it?
