Heeey! I feel pretty lousy actually! My scalp kills like mad and I feel like I'm gonna rip it out and jump on it! :) Hmm...I feel another hair wash coming on! Eugh, I always have hair washes. :( It's ok so long as the water isn't boiling hot or freezing cold which is kind of hard with our shower. Ohhh! I got locked out! My brother left me so I sat down and played with Mango then a paper boy came past so I ran inside the garage! Wow, highlife aye? I was ok though, we found coke (really scabby stuff you get at the dentist kind) and a pot of cadbury's chocolate spread so we had a few fingerfulls of that! Hehe, my mum's gonna open it up and half of it's gone! Hehehe! Ahh, I feel better now! My new shoes kill! I mean kill! They're pulling my feet inwards so I'll probably end up with totally deformed feet! Oh we're going to Scotland (madness, I know) over Easter for a week so I guess this'll be stuck with no one! "I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me!" Better not get Izzy started on that! I'm gonna go have a shower then I'll rub a tube of Anti-itchy cream into my scalp. It'll get in my hair though! Eww! Cream then wash? Hmm... wash'll wash out the cream! It's so hard! (I'll get my Mum to work it out!) Hehe! Eugh so bubi!
