katie, ur def gonna be a homocidal illiterate maniac, it suits u to a t (what that saying means!!!). i don't think i'll be gettin food while i'm there, unless i beg and plead and say its part of some sort of coursework that we have to try some sort of local cuisine!!!!!! i don't normally mind hospitals as long as it doesn't involve needles or long waits (like yesterdays long wait). i can't believe its three weeks and 4 days. (its on monday 15th dec for u deaf people who can't hear ranting about it at school!) its the last monday of term, and i wont be in for most of that week but hopefully i'll make it in for the last day. yay, we have a non school uniform day on friday, i need to find out what everyone is wearing *just so we dont have a repeat of what happened with me and emma during our yr 10 exams*. I have wearing my jeans, a black top of some sort (depends which one i feel like wearing) and my bright blue hooded fleece. katie please wear ur cool knitted top, if not give it to me!!!! *and i'll conveniently forget to give it back to you for the next 20 years!*  aaah... for the days when i was young and carefree and could wear wot i wanted with out some one saying something and being a bitch!!! I take u are coming to claire's suprise party that isn't a suprise party, if dan can persuade his parents!!! it was originally dan's idea and then we both made a guest list, and claire was sat between us with out a say in the matter. ne way must stop ranting and ranting and ooooo.......... sorry went off into a world of me own then (you dont wanna know what i was thinking). rite. rite. rite. erm. bye xoxox
