Yeah! Every one should support this Cancer Week thingy! And hey, you don't have a choice. 1 in 3 people get cancer, Nanny had it and so did my brother. Sadly Nanny died from it. :( Hmm, I'm surrounded by too much death. AAARGH! Sorry, just saw the Pete thing on flooble, god it was you Lynne? You just gave me a heart attack! Oh, my computers really mucked up! Every thing's too big, even web pages! 1 in 5 computers have a virus! Annoyed yet? (I am!) Thank you Lynne for being so kind to me! ...Although I'm not sure that I want all my readers to cry when they read my poems, guess I can express emotions through them so it's a good thing! ...in a way...! Oooh, Pretty Women! This song is sooo annoying. Did you know that they made an Abba play? Abba are anchient, can't people let them go? My mum and dad didn't like them 30 years ago so why would they like them now?! Oh, and Izzy phone me about tomorrow! Oh, and what Rosie did actual made me feel better and more secure about myself SO HA ROSIE SUCK ON THAT! *Ahem* Sorry, it's just I accidentally shoved my table a little bit into her and she shoved me and said "God fuck off Katie!" And :O Talk about unprovoked attack! Hehe... now that I think about it, damn why didn't I hit her?! I could of said it was self defence! Muhaha, have to remember that! Mmm... plate of baked beans in order or shall I just stick with custard? Heeey, I'm joking, I'm chilled really! Oh and I think we need to see Blob tomorrow, she seemed more depressed than usual. :( Poor Blob...
