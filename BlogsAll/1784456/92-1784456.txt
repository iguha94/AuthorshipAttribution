*Much much later MUCH later. Infact so much later that it may actually be considered to be 24hrs later* Sooory peeps! Oh well... I guess you don't really want to hear about the inflatable cabbages. *mmmm* Uh - actually, there weren't any, but hey you missed out on the 'posh' food on plates at the wedding. (Ok, so food on plates sounds a little bit stupid, I mean the stuff that the waiters / waitresses carry around.) *FOOD ON PLATES?* Err... Anyway, I brought the tone down by 'gracefully' falling on my butt *which is hard to do!* My brother threw a tooth pick down my dress, and I stepped back and because the bottom of the dress was so tight I stepped back onto it and fell over! (Trust me, it's easy to do that!) *I guess you don't have to be there...* Ahh but I'm tired cause we were up on our feet for about 18hrs *zzz* so I made up for it today by staying in bed till 11! (pm?) Yep, I'm typing this in my sleep, freaky huh? But I'm gonna leave you all on your own on Tuesday! *again? sob sob* Hey, that almost sounded fake! *almost? drat!* I'm going on holiday to Exmoor with Izzy and my crazy travelling circus. *I'm the professional faller-on-her-butt-gracefully, we're a rare find!* Then I'm coming back next Monday, then going away again and I'll be back next next Saturday! *Not this one, the next one* Or was it Tuesday? I dunno... the 2nd of August! And wooohooo! School holidays! YEAAAAYYYYY! *On Tuesday for me, WEDNESDAY for every one else! MUHAHAHAAA!* I love being special! :D
