Hey! This guy was writing an article about blogs and he was saying how uninteresting and uninspiring they are! Well he hasn't been to this one! (This one can't spell too!) But seriously, who gets paid to write stuff like that and who reads it? *COUGH* Oh thanks...well I didn't know! Great, let's put down thousands of people woohoo! Grrreat going... Any way in the news today; Princess Margaret died! (And yes I did have to check how to spell Margaret!) It sounds like she's had a really depressing life though. I think we should all try to make other people's lives happier and longer. What's the point of being alive if you're not happy and every one around you is depressed? We should try to improve our lives by improving others. Oh yeah, I'm hearing you, I'll shut up now! Isn't it a bit wierd that Henry VIII set up the Church of England so he could get divorced but then royals can't marry divorcees? Some one has to look into this. And because of this some royals are depressed. It must be some thing to do with God wouldn't want it or some thing... Yeah great going, cut yourself off from the Catholic church so you can divorce some one then say you can't marry a divorced person because that's against god or something? Oh by the way, I'm not trying to offend any one I'm just saying that Henry VIII was a bit stupid. ...Maybe a bit more than a bit. Yes, I will shut up now! Have a happy day and think about the consequences. (By the way I can't hear out of my right ear at all today cause of this ear ache!)
