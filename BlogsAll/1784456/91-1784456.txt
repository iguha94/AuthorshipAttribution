Ahh... so tired... I got a bit of heat stroke so I'm really tired... and I've been trying to do coursework! Some how I've ended up with all my coursework to be done in the holidays, the teachers probably think that the other teachers don't do that, but then they all do! (Maths coursework must be getting to me, I really don't make any sense) Any way... yeay! I'm back from Harrogate! Woohoo *zzz* I had fun trying on my bridesmaid dresss *eugh* it didn't make me look like erm... bad or anything which was good *sometimes they do... must be the bride flaunting her power over it* and my Auntie has a massive hat for the day *apparantly, no one can take their hat off until the mother of the bride has taken hers off* which gives her a load of power! (Ahh well... I'll just hit some one with my pose, or stand really close to someone with hay fever) *muhehe* Heeeheee, we saw this guy in a open top car with a inflatable woman dressed up in a red wig and a fancy dress! Yeah, go guy who doesn't give a damn! *and cheese snaps to the rest of us* Err... it's the heat stroke... Mmm. Oh, and I got my ears pierced but no one notices! It is me or are my blogs disappearing? *I'm going mad again* My pills! My pills! Where are they?! Mmm... maybe I need to electronically tag them ---*cut here*--- Really needed to end that randomness! Need a new head... need... mmm something. I'll find out some day what I need. *I actually need to go to sleep* Geez, I'm always really sleepy. *zzz...*   http://pub44.ezboard.com/fthelionsgrovediscussionfrm21.showMessage?topicID=103.topic  That's just boringly weird! Have fun kids.
