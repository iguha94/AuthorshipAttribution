Ok- I've been checking out work experience, here's my progress so far -   I tried the Big Issue Offices in Bristol and they told me to phone back when the boss guy was in, which I didn't because my mum told me that it was located in this dodgey place in Bristol which is the centre of a prostitution ring!! And passing cars will try to pick up anyone of female gender. My mum knows because she used to have to walk through there to get to work and she basically said - "NO WAY!!!"   So I was looking through schools, and I found this french school, which I thought would be some twee little after-school classes for kids who want to learn how to say "My name is Freddie" and such, In French. So I left a breif answer-phone message and got a bit freaked out when the voice on the machine was French... *takes deep breath*   So I visited the website and realised to my horror that it was a school for French/English kids - a PRIVATE school, £901 for 5 days!!!! Its for kids with one French parent and one English parent who want their kid to be bi-lingual. These 5 year-olds can probably speak French better than I can!   SO (argh, how many "So"s?) I was looking through the list of magazines and newspapers in the yellow pages, and I found something called the Spark Positive Change Magazine - groovy, huh? I visited the website and it's run by about 10 members of staff in a one-room office! Woohoo! And basically they sound like a load of hippies from the 70's who want to change the world...so, naturally, I emailed them! Arghh... I hope the French lady doesnt phone!  Speaking of French - Arghhh! We have to go see Mr.S tomorrow! It was all my mum, NOT me, ok???
