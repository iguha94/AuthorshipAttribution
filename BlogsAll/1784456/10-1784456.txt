Hey, I calmed down! Don't ask me what I'm doing up at nine in the morning because I don't know! Guess I'm just a little bit too weird today...weird and sleepy...zzz... Hmm I had a dream, I can't remember what it was about or what happened in it, but that's just me. I was thinking before I had the dream, about how my brother had cancer, and my Nanny had it, About how my Nanny and Grandma died of the same thing, fate? Well it makes me think how lucky we are to be alive! And when you talk about some one (behind their back odviously) all you talk about is the bad things, why not talk about the good things? Be happy to be alive! If you aren't then...well...it's like you're wasting a life. Just be happy with what you've got, who cares if your best friend's a millionaire and all you've got is a few quid? Money doesn't make you happy. It just makes you greedy, and want to show off. When you show off it makes people feel bad, so what's the point of it? Communism was a good idea I guess, just had corrupt leaders that liked killing people. I think American's were afraid of it because it ment that every one was equal, had the same amount of money, clothes and every thing! Some parts of America are glittering with money, and some are poor. I don't think they could try it because all the rich people would become a little bit poorer which is not the Americans way of life. Have a nice day and try to ignore me if you can!
