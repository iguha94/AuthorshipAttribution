It was bored. Everything it had seen had been the same thing over and over again. New species. Species dies. New species. Sure it had been hit by a few asteroids and thrown up a few volcanoes but nothing new was happening so it decided to take a nap. It had been working for a few billion years and it felt like a nap, maybe even a vacation! So the Earth dreamily drifted into a deep slumber. A few thousand years later the Earth awoke. It wasn't surprised to find a few more holes in it's shell, that was all expected but now a new species had turned up and developed. It caught the Earth's attention. The Earth was rather proud of it's new toy and took great delight in seeing how it reacted to things. First it threw up a volcano (that should get them going). The new species fled. 'Oh, so it's a bit clever' then the Earth thought. It then decided to change the temperature and see if they would fry. So it stoked up the belt round the middle of the Earth. The new species skin started to change, and changes in temper changed too. All in a few thousand years work for the Earth! It watched the species fight and live and it watched how it was deeply saddened at the loss of one of their species death but was quite happy to kill other things. The Earth thought this was naturel, and well, it is. So the Earth was pleased. Then suddenly the new species started creating havoc, it started depleting the Earth's wonderful fur coat lining that it called it's O-zone layer. They ripped it to shreds and the Earth was getting terribly sun burnt. Then they started terrorising each other in mean ways and the Earth was ashamed of it's new species. Had it changed so much in the thousands of years? No the Earth thought. It had just found new ways to wreck and destroy things.  Had a bad day-sorry! Oh Izzy feel free to take the 'micky' out of me!
