Any way, sorry I'm hyper! I had eight hours sleep last night and I've been having soooo much coke! Did you know that over in Spain six bottles of beer is £1?!?! I mean WOW! So Spain was really hot and nice! We were staying in Maro near Nerja (Ner-ha... my Dad kept coming up with jokes about that *sigh*) The place we were staying in was really nice too and we had our own pool! Posh! The only problem was it was boiling hot! We took siestas *fancy word for nap* in the middle of the day cause otherwise you melt and then did stuff for the rest. All the families were in Nerja at about 9:00 still! Geez, that's like start of drunken time in Bristol. It was nice doing that and we saw street art like dancing and flame breathing (well blowing but what the hell) and this statue guy (greeeeat). Oh, I've caught more of my brother's weird humour and I've got even weirder cause I'm reading Catch 22 which is really weird but funny! Oh, btw Shiva is this God for some religion or other (or is it demi-god?) and I think she does have eight arms, she's also the cool ice gf on FF. :D Not that I know that... Uhuh, but I'm sure you know that! All the food was lush in Spain and I tried squid! It was all chewy and hard! Hehe, freak out guys! Oh, and you lot can't have Pringles cause they've got some type of animal fat in them or some thing! My brother said that and he knows! I'm not gonna eat them any way cause apparantly they burn really quickly which means they have a load of energy in them (ie fat and sugar mmm) Have you guys been doing get togethers and including every one? Oooh, I haven't seen Jon online for ages! Is he avoiding me or some thing? Oh, I bought some tacky Spanish music! Yeay! I'll gp put it on! Oh yeayyyy! Isn't this fun! Hehe, sorry slightly weird, I'll go phone one of you or some thing to arrange some thing now!
