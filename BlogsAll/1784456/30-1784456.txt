Heeey! Oh if you click on the thing (counter) at the bottom of the page it shows you how people get here.  I'm that bored.  Any way some one searched for Edna's Goldfish and they got here! (There are some wierd links out there!) Any way, so wow some one else actually knows who Edna's Goldfish are! They rule! It's like ska, but mellow. Ok so I'm not making any sense now. Hmm what to have for dinner? Sorry. Any way I think that there best song is either Instant Message or Sunrise 2 Sunset. You can down load them off of Morpheus or whatever you use. Hey, I'm a sales person for them! (I should get paid more!) Mmm how come people go on this but never e-mail me? It must be one of those, don't know what to say. Yeah, I know the feeling. 'Hey, just saw you're blog, and all the things in your life. My name's Bob. Bye.' Mmm hmm. When I'm older (101) I wanna be a psychiatrist. Hmm. I'll go check the spelling. Wow it was right! So I can say 'Hey, I'm a shrink' Sounds good huh? (NO!) You have to train for five years as a doctor though, then branch out into Psychiatry. (I'm just in it for one of those big long leather chairs!) Apparantly not every one gets one though. :( Maybe a 21st birthday present?! I just love thinking about how other people are thinking...I make it sound so...so...wierd. I think it's great how you can think about why we think that and what other people think. Plus you get to help people so it sounds good. Hmm, now I'm thinking too much! Have fun. Oh and don't eat grass!
