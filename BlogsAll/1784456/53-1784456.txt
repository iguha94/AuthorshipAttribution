So hey. Ahh... I need to scream. Doesn't every one? Sorry about the short blog but I was all hyper and I needed to do things, but now I'm all mellow so this is gonna be one long blog. That is if I get some moral thing to rant about... Hmm... Have you tried Harry Krishna? Hehe, sorry, stuck in muppet world for a moment then! What's every one been doing? Can we go to the cinema to see that Crocodile film on Tuesday or Wednesday? Whatever suits every one but I prefer it to be Wednesday cause my mum's off on Tuesday. Aargh, my brother gets his GCSE results back some time! Eeek, scary! It's either gonna be celebration time or his social life going down the pan. Aww, poor flatrik. Hey that was Izzy that thought of that name! Was it? Or was it some other weird person... (Not that I'm surrounded by weird people or any thing.) I recon the last people in Big Brother should boycott it and both of them walk out just before they read out the winner or some thing. Hehe, that would be funny! But Laura would probably start crying... and no one would do that because of all the money you win. *sigh* It's all about the money nower days isn't it? Money to greed. The base of evil. Hey, I'm sorry I guess I read too many books and watch too many cartoons! Or... I'm just weird... Yeah, I'm weird. And now... On to taking over the world with this banana! (...I don't see a banana...) Visualise man! Ok, I'm going! Bye bye!
