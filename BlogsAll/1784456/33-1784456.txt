Okkk! I'm listening to System Of A Down - Legend Of Zelda! It's got the backround music of Zelda on it! Hehe... hehe... weird! Any way I was thinking about... cannabis! (Uhuh... really... and how long have you felt this way?) And we did a load of reasearch in it and I think it should be legalised! It's got some healing properties so in some ways it's better than smoking. Any way, we have alcohol and smoking, why not cannabis? If there is a legal way to get it (not through a dealer) then it can't lead you onto harder drugs because there wouldn't be a way of getting them. See where I'm coming from? Yeah, it gives you a high but so does Alcohol and smoking! Oh and all this stuff about brain damage... Yeah well they haven't really proven it! Geez I'm going a bit mad! One bad thing is that if it's got this white mold on it then it can really harm you... but legally that wouldn't happen would it? It should be legalised for MS patients though. My mum could of gone into a test where you try it out but then you wouldn't be able to drive so she didn't do it! In Glastonbury (Hey shoot me, I know my spelling sucks) we bought some cannabis seeds and because it was the seeds and you didn't smoke it the lady said that it didn't give you that bigger high and it was more on the medical properties. Mmm...bird seeds! My mum used it because she's got Multiple Schlerosis so it helped her. Any body else got any views? Wow, this is a nice brick wall I'm talking to. Okk so I should really get some music therapy!
