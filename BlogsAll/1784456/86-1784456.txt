Ah the Dan thing. Turns out he was going out with some one when he was gonna ask Izzy out and he liked Izzy when he was going out with Debbie. *As my mum would put it, relationships are the hardest things.* Or are they? I guess they are? Dan's just too... flirty? I seriously think he might be gay when he's older! *According to other sources as well* Mmm... tea... sauces.  You think you can have it all, You would take it any way. But you can't have me, You never will.  THIRD EYE BLIND! Ahhhh! Sorry, hyper phase! HeheheehoooHOOO! Nevermind... any way seeing as I'm hyper I can type quickly! Yeay! Dan's such a player though, but he doesn't like me and Laura one bit! He totally doesn't talk to us! But hey, we're spinsters! (Proven fact ya know) Ahh yes FF10... I seriously should actually play that. I kind of got to the end without getting to extra Aeons, and I missed out all the cool chocobo stuff! *sniff sniff* Life's harsh when you're a kid. Dreaming's my escape. Sorry about the randomness *again* just trying to bring a bit of confusion into your already confused lifes. I think when you saw the 'just to keep me sane' you already switched off. Oh geez, now William Tell? What is up with our playlist! Sorry, my *brothers* play list! We've got Barry White, Motzart, Manu Chao and Opeth! How ...random! Maybe I should change my name on this to 'random'. Oh Lynne, some one got on this by searching for you're name! BE AFRAID, BE VERY AFRAID! (I am!) I'll just go back to hiding in the hole! I might not be on again tonight cause my brother wants a loooong go but otherwise see youuusie latersie.
