Oh today was fun. I walked home, that was fun...That's the best thing about school, it actually makes you appretiate getting home, away from some people (I'd prefer not to disclose that information :)) The one thing that's in my head when I'm walking home-I need the loo! I all ways do when I'm walking home! I think it's because I never go in the school loo's, yes, that's right! I never ever have been in the school loo's! I never need to go! (Queer girl) Yup :) I walked past a load of horse poo, it's become like a land mark: you're nearly home. The horse has either come back and stood on it or it's been trodden on by thousands of school kids...Hmm I'm betting on the Mum's push chair cot thingys (Well I don't know do I!) Before you get the idea that I'm 3, I'm not, I'm 13! (Wow aint she old?) Not really... Yeah I think I'll try to jazz this up (there is a way!) Something to do with adding a thingy? (Yup, I get it) And something to do with putting a bravenet.com counter thingy on! So we can see how miserably no one views this! (Cause if any one did they'd probably e-mail me to beg me to stop boring them!) Apart from I'll probably press refreshx100 and fix it ;) I bet that's what every one does! Oh sorry, I'm just trying to get the full out of my internet use because my brother's all ways on, yup, I do blab too much! (And what's up with all the yup's???
