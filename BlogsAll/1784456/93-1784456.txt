YEAY! I'm speaking to someone in Spanish! *badly :( * And don't ask why someone would actually want to talk to me over the net... ask them! Well yeay! Russia was sooo cool, but the first day we were all like 'WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING HERE?' But then it got better! *phew* Do you know what it's like spending a week with a family that speaks to each other in a different language?!?! (Well... apart from my family) Me = Martian . Them = Aquatic *whatever that is..* Oh dear... I really do suck at Spanish! Anyway, we eventually settled in and eventually we all found Russia amazing, the food was so great! *Yup, I suck at describing words today* (It's worse in Spanish!) Oh, btw, no one in Russia likes Tatu! Ha! They really are crap! Uhh yeah... I'll just mold *or is it mould? Mmm... one of them's edible... * (Maybe not) myself into the pink *don't touch the page!* Oh, ho>? *typing kept in for added realisation that I'm not perfect* Well... not online ;) (Is it me or does that sound extremely err dodgey?) It probably would be if I could spell dodgey. Yeay! I can scare Spanish people too! I just said: Lo siento por mi falta de palabras y cerebro. Oh err crap, apparantly it means this : I feel it for my lack of words and brain. AAARGHHH! I seriously can scare Spanish people with my lack of Spanishness! What the hell are they talking to me for?!?! *probably for a laugh at my feeble attempts*
