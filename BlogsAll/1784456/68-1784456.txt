Aww poor laura! Can we call you Gappy? On the subject of potato cuisine...do you think that moulding a lump of mashed potato into the shape of a slice of bread, covering it in flour and putting it in the toaster would be a healthy alternative to toast?  I've been wallpapering today - yay!! Laura you should have your screen name as Respect Potatoes! (how did i get from potatoes to wallpapering and back to potatoes again? Weird.) I'm doing a paperround on weekday mornings this week. It sucks. They even had the nerve to phone me up at 5:30pm and ask if I could to an evening round all week too, after bullying me into the one in already doing. "Hi Izzy, can you pleeeease do me a big big fav-" No! "Pleeeease do an evening round for me this week-" NO! "Oh go on-" NO NO NO! "Ok then bye." I'm telling you, I'm quitting after next week, I have seriously had enough of this sucky job. (Did you ever used to do potato printing when you were a kid?) My mum is obbsessed with the TV series "24" . Theres been 24 hour-long episodes and the series is set over 24 hours. Apparently its good, but my mum (being my mum) watched 23 episodes...all except the last one! She woke up at 6:30 this morning and goes - "Oh god, I've missied the last episode of 24!" But luckily theres a repeat on today, and theres been a sticky note on the TV since 8:30am saying - "Don't miss last espisode of 24 repeated at 10:30pm" ! Talk about obsessive! (Have you ever realised how nice potatoes are?) Aww -  Malcom in the middle was sooooo funny. Ive downloaded the theme tune by They Might Be Giants. I've downloaded some of there other stuff. They're pretty cool. Potatoes...potatoes.... Oh thanks a lot Laura!
