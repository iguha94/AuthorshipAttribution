Sorry my loyal fans that this hasn't been updated. Oh and Daisy the flying pig is okay now and the tree is unharmed. Hmm parallel universe or just pure fantasy? I'm going with the fantasy... Anyway I have this thing in my knee that kills so I get to miss PE! (Muhahahaaa!) Woohoo! Oh and about walking home... (It was tough but some one had to do it!) About that... well I was thinking (bad sign) (shut up with the ( ) !) Hmm I need to talk to some one... other than myself! ANYWAY I WAS WALKING HOME good that shut her up. I was walking home and I was thinking about how you're judged about how you look and act and everything and how that happens with the parents walking past to collect the primary school kids from the school that I was past. You can breathe now. I was thinking how sad it is that people compare themselves to each other, but is it so sad? It might be kind of strange but in a way it makes you feel better. In a horrible way. If you say "Gee whiz, look at her hair!" (And God help any body that does say Gee Whiz) That means that maybe you feel a bit unsecure about your hair and it makes you feel better and gives you a confidence boost... enough of my ramblings. But that's what blogger's about... isn't it? Hmm I really should tell all this to something else other than a computer! (Not that any one else than my computer and Izzy reads this!)...OH. OH... OH... darn. Darn this blogger no-cussing (for you Americans) thing! Non-swearing for people who know what that means... Umm HELP! I just uhh lost the start bar and this screen has gone allll big. I mean whole screen big! (I'm good at mucking up my computer aren't I?) Who needs a virus when you can do it yourself!? Oh I better go...and pretend that nothing happened! Oh and I'm working towards telling some one my ramblings...some day! E-mail me (Hah!) if you want to hear... and no the world isn't pink... or is it?
