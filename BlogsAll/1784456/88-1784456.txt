Hey Kiddies. My computer's gone wacko again. Apparantly I'm posting to ee   e Sane. Weird huh? Little green men again! Damn them! *yawn* I think I need a nap. Too much chocolate... Aargh it's so weird though, it tastes pointless! (v weird) I haven't been eating it for ages (lent thingy)  and then suddenly I start eating some *cough cough cough*. Okay, okay, three eggs isn't that much you know! (Still got the big one left!) Aaah! Some one help me. Wait a minute, noooo! My chocolate! Get off! (Ehe) Aaah so frustrated... too contained... need to go mad again... You know, when you go all serious and don't have fun, mostly cause you're not with your friends.... aaah better phone Izzy... are we doing any thing tomorrow? (Probably) Hehe... so much for being arranged! Yep, English totally doesn't make sense! Or maybe it's my use of it that's flaud (Both?) Never mind. I've gone all arty at the moment, I'm trying to do some 'painting' *eeeeeeeee* Not good. And general lets think about life thingy. DAMN! NEED MINSTRELS! More like E numbers. Am I actually this boring in real life? Yep, definatly one of these 'i am not worthy oh god of pink bunny flowers'. AAAH listening to Beetles. AAAH! MISSING SIMPSONS! AAAH haven't phoned Izzy! AAAH AAAH! Definatly need to get out more. Some one come and drag me out of my house please! AAAH BEATLES STILL ON! Phew, it's only... Crosby, Stills, Nash? and Young? Who the hell? Sounds like the Beatles though.... AAAAHHHHH!
