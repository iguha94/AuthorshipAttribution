Hmm haven't you used that excuse before? I'm sure you have. Grr, I had to walk home from piano with the streets lights on! And these people started shouting "Oy, girl!" so I kind of muttered "What if I'm not a girl." Hmm, crazy. Then this guy started walking in front of me, he walked in front of me all the way home! I saw some people I knew so I kept my head down. Must of looked a bit crazy walking back from school at 4:45! I wanted to stamp 'Just been to piano' on my head but I decided to do it when I got home. Wow Izzy, I didn't know you were imaginary person! Hehe Izzy loves Jason! Muhahaha I'm going to spred it on the net! ...To people that don't even know you!... Oh and my excuse *cough* reason is that I'm being assulted by my Maths teacher with a ball point pen! He's hitting it on my pen! And I'm always being mentally assulted. I'm watching this programme about Norwiegans *whatever* who swapped houses with English people. Hmm, they eat whale beaf. Erm...guess we have different ways of living? And eat sausage rolls on there own. (Who does that?) And they like English beaches? (!) CRAZY! Hey, hate our food and our beer! Go back to Norway then! Well actually England is boring, the food is okay but Izzy said we have cheap chocolate or something...? So erm any Americans out there send me Hersley (Is it Hersley? What do I know!) bars! I loooove them!
