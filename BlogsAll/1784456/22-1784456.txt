Mmm, for three days running, people have died on the M4. Now doesn't that make you feel safe? Ehe. And the Bristol box as it's called is a bad spot. Hmm, well I just go in that about once a week. It's worse than the bemuda triangle it's the BRISTOL BOX! Kind of has an edge to it don't you think? No...neither do I... Well walking to piano! Well this girl was kind of walking on the other side of the road talking (this girl told me she didn't want to walk with me any more, yeah, thanks for that) and I was like tum-tee-tum just looking at the houses dee dee doo. Then she went! Yeay! So then I got to piano (pretty rubbish story isn't it?) and I walked mud all over her carpet! Hehe I was looking at this lush view thinking 'only in nailsea could you find such a lush view in such a crappy place'. Grr, I hate reading-news people, could they find a more boring voice? I walked past this house and on one side it had pointy trees and on the other it had bumpy trees and I thought this is England, trying to be perfect or not. IDIOTS! This girl was saying she thought her brother had the flu but her actually had Lukemia and died. What stupid pathetic idiots... I'm sorry I just feel a bit strongly about this. Yeah, no one really understands about other people feeling sad, I guess no one really wants to. Happy happy. I'm sorry I really should stop watching the news. Aargh! The news! Imber Village is kind of freaky... it's like empty with empty houses. Then you see the army driving around. What?! Crazy! Ahem. Izzy smells like stilton! Tee-hee!
