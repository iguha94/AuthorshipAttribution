Playdays! You should be ashamed!  Awww poor you, but you did manage to miss mr.k in a big stress! It was funny cos Laura and Beki and me were in the music block at registration (cos we had chamber group and then music) and beki was bored and she drew this picture of mr.k on the board (hey, bored - board! wow! ok, carrying on,) with no hair and a manic grin and smoke coming out of his ears! And when he came in he was in a really big stress and he pulled the board down and saw beki's picture! Need i say more... Hey! I tried to search on Google for our site by typing in peanut shells (scrool up or check the archives if you don't know what I'm talking about) and I found this site with the word "peanut" the word "shells" and it was made by someone called Kes and someone called Izzy! How freaky is that? And no, I'm sure it wasn't the same one. *sigh* Wow, must be wierd forgetting things like that, could have used it to your advantage though, and forgotten what vincent looks like, oh well. Arghh, Pooey stupid Mr.Thackray kept picking on me in maths again and making jokes about me being on another planet (don't say anything) and looking like I was asleep, I  was looking at the board like everyone else! Six times in one leson he'd picked on me, calling me Iz, with his big smarmy egotistic (is that a real word?)  voice. Oooh, he makes me mad. And Emma said that Father Christmas wasn't real! and everyone (most of us) was saying that we still believed in him and Emma was getting in a big stress and taking it really seriously, and ooh! - I can come to Claire's partay (oh - yay is hear you cry) cos the smelly concerts on a different week. I was having fun yesterday sorting all my contacts on msn into groups (you can do that on the new version, its cool) and I have Boring people who never talk, People who are never online, People who should rot in hell (guess who's in that one) Strange friends, and Larries! How cool!
