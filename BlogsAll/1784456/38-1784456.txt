So...hey! It's the national club of the bored people at home here! Woohoo! Hmm... what site to find, yes, I figured out where to use the word site! (Wow!) Must be like a miracle or some thing (please don't tell me what I spell wrong) Eek, SATs in less than a wekk. *groan* definatly a bad thing, all that pressure and testing all for the school that is super duper stupid! Oh, gross uninteresting fact, did you know that your hair is actually dead? Gross huh, so next time you give your hair the full works think about it, it freaked me out for a bit. Be cool if it was alive though! Like that lady on Mortal Kombat (the game on the sega (about 300 years old)) with the cool hair where she flips people with it and knocks them out! Ooh, that lady was cool, eugh I can't believe it, I've watched the movie, seen the cartoons and played the game. The game was actually a 18 cause of tiny splats of blood here and there... *cough* I think that Amelie could of been a 15 if they cut out 'those bits' cause they had nothing to do with the story and were randomly thrown in! Aww, Cleo's helping me... well she's kind of trying to rub the desk with her chin. My cats can get annoying though, they always want hugs and you can't do your homework around them cause they sit on your hand. Uhuh, I'm ramboling here (eek shoot me for spelling) I better go, if I actually think of some thing interesting for a change then you'll be the first to know!
