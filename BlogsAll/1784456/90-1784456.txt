Ahh... so physically drained. Yeesh, I feel like I'm gonna faint. Damn exams... *yawn* I'm going alright so far, I've got three results back; English - A, History - A*, Chemistry - 67%. (I almost put Chimistry, that's how bad I am at it!) Ahh I should be find... mind over matter, I've been doing a lot of that recently. Or is it mind over mind? Ahh... sooo tired, I keep typing the wrong stuff sorrrry! Hmm... but I did badly in chemistry... well... kind of.We do three sciences and get two GCSE's for it! How whacked is that? Mind you, doing three GCSE's in the sciences is supposed to be hard! *i'd rather do one!* Aggh, my right ears packed up! STUPID SCHOOL! (Ahh, you can blame school for every thing!) I HAVE NO LIFE! STUPID SCHOOL! (Well... maybe not that...)   Has every one been following the war on the news? It's so different on Sky news and BBC news. We don't really know what's going on though. Half of it's propaganda, and the other half is rumours, what is going on? Every point of view is bound to be biast though. Oh, and we should care. This is happening because we can't stop it. People are dying. We should at least try. Why create more deaths and suffering, when there's already too much in the world? Why bother? As some person said, (or my mum :P not sure) truth is the first victim in war.   Ooh, meaninful point: we shouldn't take things at face value. I found a point! *finally!* I have meaning in my life! (Oh dear God)
