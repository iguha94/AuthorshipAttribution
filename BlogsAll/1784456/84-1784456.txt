And for all dense dense people (like me, I'm not sure than there are any others out there) I removed the link. Sorry Dado Rail, but hey you have to tell me some thing a million times to get through some times (too many times in there?) Yup! *dog mode* Ahh... so... bloody...  COLD  (Yes! I've suddenly discovered the bold tags!)   http://uk.weather.yahoo.com/UKXX/UKXX0025/index_c.html  Yeah... god! High's of 4oC! Wow... geez arrgh my legs are gonna drop off in a minute! Especially in PE... I mean god, they wouldn't put us outside would they...? Ah, but the only kick in life PE teachers get is watch us running around in the freezing cold! Maybe Ms Broom will carry out her cross country threat... YAAARFG!!!H!! (Erm... more like YAAARGH!) Whoops, sorry, sneezed. (Weird.) Hehe, school was funny. Izzy told us an embarrassing story, and as I ohso love sharing these *muahahaaa* I will! She was mucking round with her friend in orchestra (trust me, you don't want the teeny details) and suddenly (maybe you do, geez this is hard to follow) *suddenly?* they started talking about Monkey Island thingy, and they both do the 'point to a vacant spot and shout look it's a three headed monkey' thing *brain breath* like you do.... or I do.... and then this boy walked into Izzy's vacant spot and went 'EH?' (Or some thing like that) Maybe it was fait (crappy spelling) fate? Err... scratch that. Maybe it was fate, maybe it was destiny, or maybe it was Izzy's bad smell that drove him. (Aren't I just lovely?) Not really I spose. Wow, lets all go heavy metal with Opeth! (Freaky!)
