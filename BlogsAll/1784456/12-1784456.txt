Hi there laura! i got your really great email reminding me of what we heard 1000 times! I think we're kind of brainwashed i am an idiot by it and we might just start saying i am an idiot in the i am an idiot of a sentance without realising it i am an idiot.   So anyway, after my stupid angry computer decided it would make my day by deleting all my rambling about cross country i'll type it all again for all you lucky things to read -  No i won't, i'm fed up of thinking about it. Hey i've just got an email back to me saying that my reply to laura@aol.com *way to post Laura's e-mail, sorry had to change it for Laura's sake* or whatever (wonder who she is) could not be delivered because you don't accept emails with attachments yaahda yaahda yaah... but there were no attatchments! Grrrr.... So that's why you didnt get the logo thingy ohhhhhh... see my powers of deception are admazing.  And arghh!!! these stupid boys keep following us around, we so are freak magnets, and katie hasa decided that she's the head of the COF Gang (Collection Of Freaks) and that we're all freaks. (Speak for yourself) And Nooooooooo I have to put up with scary freaky derranged David Greening at Orchestra tomorrow. The words Why Me? come to mind.... He should be given the Nobel Freak Prize for biggest freak. And Charlotte still owes me £3 !! Her stupid brother took it grrrr... Or DID HE? find out after the break.
