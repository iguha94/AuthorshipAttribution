I have been thinking. shock shock horror horror I know but anyway.  With Laura going out with Ben it started the whole of something new into our lives, something that many of us had never experienced before.  Or we may have done but not on a serious level.  What I am talking about is the male species.  When Laura first started dating Ben she changed.  Some may say that this change was for the better, and others for the worst.  We make jokes about it, being a spinster etc. but deep down inside we knew that she had something that we didn't, and we were jealous, even if we didn't think we were.  When Laura dumped Ben we saw another change, she had experienced life with guys, and this time being single didn't mean just making a joke out of it, she wanted to "play the field".  She had got what she had wanted, but now she wanted more.  This may sound like I am being a bit of a switch but I will carry on.  When there were rumers about Dan liking Izzy she used to get cross with people if they asked her what was going on with her and him.  An example of this is when at her party I sed that she would probably hit me if i asked but i was going to ask anyway.  She then hit me and sed that there was nothing going on, and there never would be.  HOW WRONG WAS SHE!!??  She is now activley dating someone.  She has now experienced life with guys aswell, and once her and Dan are finished she will want some more too!   Basically the point I am trying to make is, we are changing, it may be for better or worse, but we have to make use of what we have and not joke about it.  Deep down inside I know I'm jealous, are you?? xx
