One other thing... all this stuff about designing your own child, would you? Say you did, would your child be happy knowing that they were what  you  wanted, not what  they  wanted. Would they have a right to blame you if some thing bad happened to them because of their looks? And say you didn't. Say that they thought they were fat and ugly and every one else was perfect. Would they not then blame you for not deciding to design them and make them thin and pretty - all the things we supposedly want. If they were dumb and you could have chosen to make them clever would they blame you? Surely it would get stupid because every one would be stupidly clever. Who would be left to do all those jobs that every one does for a holiday job when they're a teenager? These jobs still have to be done. Maybe robots will do it, but then the electricity is needed and we're polluting our environment enough as it is. In the future are we going to solely depend on robots? Will we rot away in our houses never doing and exercise or any work that requires moving? Will socializing be done over holographic phones so you need not go any where? What happens if all the robots break, then how will we survive? Will we again rot away, what ever we choose. Will I ever shut up? (Sorry had to add that in, stupidly long string of questions!) I strive to think so others need not. I help others think so I may not. I try to do both, so questions have answers. (EH? Ahh well... bubi!)
