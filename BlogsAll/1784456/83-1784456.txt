Ok well... we have not been writting alot on blogger this week have we??  I am really not tired STILL!!!  Does anyone know if milkways can be made in Kingsize, or am i just being as dence as a dimond at the moment?? i keep thinking of you've got mail as i'm typing this because my keyboard makes exactly the same noise when I type as it did when they typed.  Freaky eh?  I feel like typing random stuff becasue i am really bored at the moment, no one is online I have no homework or any work in any shape way or form 2 do and the television thats on 2nite is pants!!  Hey i'll keep smilling.  So my new favourite phrase to ask is;  whats your opinion of chocolate tea pots??  Its a very interesting question.  I mean you mey neva own one but think of the amazment and ore it would bring to your life if you did.  I think that our discussion of world issues last nite really helped us to understand each other better.  I mean i never thought i would see Emma saying that we needed to be quieter!!  I mean i thought Emma was the Queen of noise, o well.  I actually learnt alot of stuff last nite that i sorta knew but it expanded my knowledge on it, if you get my drift.  I think that i had better go now, as i have 2 email several people all about different things!!  O well. Toodles xx
