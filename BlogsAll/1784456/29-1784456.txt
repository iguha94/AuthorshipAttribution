Hi again! Sorry about no blogs, but I've been shopping! I'm really bad at shopping, I guess I'd flunk retail therapy. I went in and came out, the only things I bought was about 100 drinks! Then I got some padded plasters cause my shoes were rubbing! Wierd huh? I had to buy twenty for one! Hehe. Guess it was worth it. Well I kind of put one on, then put a bigger one over the top and Izzy took one and she can't get it off! Owchie! Oh also my brother and his friends are cooking tonight! Aargh! I've gotta phone the doctor before he comes! Don't tell him, but last time he cooked it kind of gave me a bit of a stoumach bug! Mmm. But it's alright, cause he said we're eating Mango! (the cat if you don't follow this, I doubt any one does...apart from if you're looking for pea nut shells! (nod and walk away)) Mmm, still not cured from my manic speaking and typing problem! Hey I got a lot of brownie points today, we helped an old lady because she couldn't get up the escalators (whatever) so we helped her up the lift! Heeey Alkaline Trio are a good band too! Hmm I really really should get paid more! Mmm I should start looking for more people to go on this, it's too quiet and even though every one's oh-so happy listening to me blabbing it kind of gets boring listening to yourself! Oh and now my chocobo's red! Sorry I'm kind of overly obsessed! (Aren't you!) Hey I have to think of some thing really and clever and wise to say, wait a minute......Oh! Be happy who you are and where you are because you could be some one different some where else. Okay so leave out the wise bit and that's fine! (It sounds clever!) I better go raid the biscuit tin and check the cats haven't found it first! Bubi. - Kes
