Hey guys! Or peeps... or things... or blobs from the planet Miscallaneous... who can't spell (my home planet incase you were wondering!) So every thing looks brighter now and hopefully people are happier! Ow, clicked my back, seem to do that a lot but I click my hips a lot more... wow full of useless information! Every one the best song is Private Eye by Alkaline Trio! It's so cool, oh and if you listen to the lyrics it's funny! Well, I find it funny, but I do have a scary mind. If people knew what I was thinking I think I might have a two mile radious! (Oooh, fancy!) Hehe, but yeah I think about how if the world flooded and all the houses had these cute flotation devices, then ours broke... uhuh, see my radious is getting bigger already! Oh, the radious thing, it's just that people site miles away from us in school so I always say that I have a one mile radious and every one stares at me and backs up a bit more! Fun! :) :) :)! Eek, my computer went a bit wierd, I think I'm typing too quickly so it freaked out! (Yeay, just the hoover left now!) Uhuh... Ok so hyper happy! Woohoo! Sorry, listening to ska! Who needs drugs when you've got ska! Ok, so that may sound like a drug but it's music! ...Anyway... oooh, um I found a cool spanish web site, ok so me and izzy found it! So you can look at it here   http://www.clubplaneta.com/cocina/huevos/receta15.htm   Then go here   http://babelfish.altavista.com/  to translate it, it's sooo funny! Or maybe it's just cause we were hyper at the time but oh well! :) Oh and I do put links up, those web pages are links but they aren't under lined! (Did any one know that any way?) Bubi!
