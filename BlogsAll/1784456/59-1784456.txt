Hi people, ok so I have scary friends but what can I say? I am scary! Ok so I keep hearing some one knocking on the door, maybe I do need hearing aids! Yeay! Any way today was fun! Apart from the WSL's kept talking about me in French and major freak out so we ended up writing a load on the table about it and then Izzy had to rub it out before the teacher saw! Hehe funny! Oh and I was freaked by some thing else but oh well... In art Laura attacked me with chalk! so i fought back and now we're both covered in it, eek don't kill me mum! (My t-shirt used to be white!) Jon got stressy cause I wouldn't tell him what this was, oh and he attacked me and it hurt so I kind of whaked him. Geez, he's soooo week! Wow, I still can't spell! Some one buy me a book called 'How to spell'! Back to WSL thing, well they were like KATIE and then one of them was saying "Oh my god, I wouldn't do that Rosie" so I think she's got a evil plan for me! YEAY! Haha, lets watch Katie take her anger out on Rosie, that could be fun! Never mess with some one who is happy almost all of the time because they probably have a load of anger stored up and they're probably meaner than the mean people! Ok, well it doesn't make sense... but it does in way.
