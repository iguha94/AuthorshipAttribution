Great Izzy! Hehe... kind of added a stupid pink tint to my last serious blogs! I'm guessing that you didn't read them then! -_- Ok... so we were posting at the same time? Whoops! I didn't notice! Sorry! And hey, we could have talked if I was on Msn! I really should go on it more... yeah *cough* Any way sooory 4th book! YEAY! Oh it's sooo good! Bit scary at one point, but I was reading it at night! Yeah... I'm reading it again! WOOHOO! Sorry but YEAY! Ohhh.... I want the 5th book! *stamps around the err... room?* Hehe! Cool, I can strop again! Ever think what I'll be obsessed with when I've stopped reading Fushig Yuugi? Ahh heck... Sailor Moon manga! Yeay! Hehe... I will never become unhyper and unobsessed! (Are those even real words?) Nah, ahh heck who's actually reading this and gonna notice any way? Wow! The counter's on 2222! Or was... I'm betting that by the time some one reads this it'll be on 2230! *Huh... yeah sure...* More like -10 if that could happen with a counter... which I'm guessing couldn't... Mmm... oh guys! Monkey Island 1!!! Otherwise known as *lemme check...* the secret of monkey island! Wow! Go search for it on KaZaA (Any one can but I'm talking to frizzoble and lara at the mo.) Or I can send it to you! Oh, and don't be dumb, try to remember what ping is! *sigh* Ok... I'm gonna go browse the net, poke me if you need me.
