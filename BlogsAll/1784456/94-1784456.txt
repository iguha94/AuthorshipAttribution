Heeeey I'm back *again, this is getting old now, isn't it?* Well anyway... London was sooo cool! I loved it! :D We saw Bombay Dreams! Which was really good, (ok so the plot was predictable and corny but hell, the music was good!) It's kind of one of these 'oh, this would be good for people who didn't know this moral lesson already'. It was one of the 'we can't be together' 'but i love you' things, you know? Good the first time, but predictable the next. Oooh, and what else did we do? Oh yeah, we saw Buffallo *how do you spell that!* Soldiers. It's probably the most depressing film that I've seen. Don't believe the reviews, they were calling it 'really funny' and 'like catch 22'. Catch 22 did not have all the gore and head screwy stuff that went on! It was a really sad.. and disturbing movie. Err, hell go blow yourself out if you want to watch it, but don't expect it to be funny! London is sooo amazing, it's full of loads and loads of different cultures, religions, languages! One day I heard Spanish, Italian, German, French, *and a whole load of languages that I couldn't even begin to understand (hindi), Japanese, Chinese! I loved it! The diversity was just soooo good, I love that *compared to Nailsea it's heaven*. Err also we went to Notting Hill, *there was a cool market* and I got this cool pathwork silk skirt for £5! Hehe I'm gonna love freaking people out with it... not that it's not cool... *hehe* Ahh I have fun wearing whatever I want in Nailsea *it has to be the most boring place in the whole world!!!*
