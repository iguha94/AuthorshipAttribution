Oh sorry about not blogging for ages, just I was reading Fushigi Yuugi 3 yesterday! It's sooo depressing! Aww! Well.. not that much but it's pretty sad! I don't know how, but I wanna know how Yu Watase keeps coming up with these great story lines! The story never slows down and you always wonder what's going to happen. Geez, when the characters get a break another thing happens! There's only one thing for it... I WANT BOOK 4!!!! *throws a strop* Please!!! Naah, I'll get it when I get some actual money... some day in the distant future. Yeah right! Actual money! These books are like £11.99 a book! Eeek! So by the end (if I ever get to the end of the story) I'll of spent about £71.94 on Fushigi Yuugi! :O Aarghsiee! (And yes, I did use a calculator to work that out) Oh, all my family are having a car boot sale at the market to raise money for Rik cause apparantly he's now going to Peru! I woke up too late so I couldn't go, I've also got home work to do! :( Meanie teachers! Wait a minute! There's now 7 Fushigi Yuugi books! They put one on amazon.co.uk without me noticing and no one told me!!! Oooh, it hasn't been published on amazon.com (geez obsessed much?) either! Wow, we're actually getting new manga at the same time they get it in America! :O That never happens! Wow, some one up their likes me! Just like when we went to Forbidden Planet and they hadn't cleared out the Manga bit (the bit around it had gone!) Nooo! So long as they don't take out the Manga I'll be able to breathe! Hmm... I better post this then post an actual blog! (EH?) Oogsie!
