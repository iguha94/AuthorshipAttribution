Hmm I think that every one has a place to be in life. Who ever we are and whatever we look like we can all do something good. You can live your life at 20 stone and think 'I acheived something.' Who cares about the brainless bimbo's that cross your path now and then? If I had a lawn mower everyone who told me to 'get a life' would be bald in ten seconds flat. Why should we have to put up with other peoples ignorance? It just makes me happy to know that I'm happy with life and hopefully it rubs off on other people. I know that I have my off days and strike out at people but that's not the real you. Some people just find it hard to say sorry. I find it quite admazing how one little word can ruin some one's day, constantly thinking about it. So admaze yourself today, admit the mistake and say sorry. No one is in the worst place, no one has had a completely ruined life, you just think you have. No matter who or what we are I think we should all have the best in life. Yes, terrorism is wrong but should a war be started that kills so many lives just to satisfy the peoples need for 'justice' but why have these people done this and what is the right thing to do? I don't think any one can get the correct answer, I think we can only guess. We all have created our own sense of justice and it's not right to compare one to another, it's the rules by which we life by. I am just happy to be alive, think of how many times in your life you may not of been so lucky. Think of how many people have died wishing 'I wish I could of...' Think how lucky you are to able to do these things. Don't let a moment pass you by without fully appretiating it. So everyone get up and live! (I'm sorry, I'm having a moral understandings kind of day :) ) Add comments to my moral ramblings if you want to, and make some one's life worth living. (I'm sorry, I'll try to control it.)
