Heeey yeah, today was fun. We've got this new person in our class, Michael (can't spell eep!) and he's ok. He'll be a bit more chatty when he gets settled down I think. Hehe, it's fun watching everyone in our class ignore it, isn't it? Mmm... but it's their fault, we're being all open and 'we don't care who you are, come talk to us!' ...must... stop dwelling on this! I might go all depressed again if I'm not careful... Oh, I've totally given up hope on Rosie. I guess I had this view that every one was really nice but it's been totally scrubbed by her. Yeah, I know niave (speleeeleleleiiing!) or what but still it was a nice notion I guess. She's just so horrible, and for her own personal gain. If she ever had any nice bones in her body I think they would of exploded by the time she was three. What's up with her? I bet she has one of these 'divorced parents, dead relatives story', but then, doesn't everyone? Ok, sorry, I'm listening to Bob Marley and I'm going all psylophical (owch, bite me) and err... rastafarian like! Fun! Mmm... I was trying to help her out and she just said "shut up" really seriously and it hit me. I was being kind, not provoking her or doing any thing to her apart from offering her kindness and then she's just mean and throws it back in my face, what's her problem? Is it so hard to even think about being nice to people? Can she think of no other's apart from herself? I never want to know her when I'm older and I doubt that any one else will. Ok, I'll snap out of it in a bit and blog later! Bubi!
