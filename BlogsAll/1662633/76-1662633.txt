         HOLLA, it's FRIDAY THE 13th, ya'll!!  And a crazy thing happened to me today!!  so i'm at subway today waiting in line to order my 6" veggie on parmesan oregano, provolone cheese, lots of spicy mustard, with everything - no jalepenos, when who walks right past me?!  THE GIRL I HOOKED UP WITH IN MY DREAM LAST NIGHT!! Not even joking!  Same cute little bleach-blonde pixie haircut with the EXACT SAME pink bandana in her hair!!  It was crazy!!  But... She left subway with some guy, so i guess the reality of me and her ending up together really was "in my dreams..."  Story #2:  I'm in class today, and this class is the nerdiest class you can take, and it's full of total geeks, and when i say geeks, i'm talkin' these guys cracked up when my professor asked us this:  "Now, 13 is never an even number, right?  That is, it can never be divided by two without having a remainder..."  And most everyone nods and agrees, and then Boy Wonder in the front row YELLS OUT, "WRONG!  If you write 13 in base5, then it becomes 8, which is definitely divisible by two!!!"  *Laughter and applause ensue...*  You get the picture, back to the story... So not to sound high and mighty, but when I walk into the room, all eyes on me.  Reason for this: I'M THE ONLY GIRL.  Well, there's actually 3 other girls, but you can't really tell that they're girls, so, yeah.  So i stand out enough in this class as it is...  So I'm sitting there taking notes, not laughing at the 13 turn 8 scenario, when I pull out my Perrier.  Keep in mind, Perrier is carbonated, so when I open it, it must have gotten shook up cause it sprays all over me and I'm all wet!  I was so embarassed! well, at least it was just water...  Can't wait for the sue post-weekend update...  Sue - I live vicariously through you and all your hot steamy dance nights and dates and kissy kissy, since school has been forcing me to be a bonafide geek lately...  holla
