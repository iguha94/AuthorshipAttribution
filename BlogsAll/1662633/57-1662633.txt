         hi.  I am on muscle relaxers which means SHAWNA IS HIGH. I dont know why but they really make me act weird.... whatever... i never smoke weed so i guess i have to get high some way. the muscle relaxers do not take away the pain.. they make me tired and high. But i need help sleeping since im an insomniac so i figured i would take em anyway. Anyway so since the accident I have pretty much done.... well nothing. My back hurts like crazy so I skipped art tonight... i figured standing up and drawing for three hours was not a good idea. And i cant handle listening to LUC explain how to draw a hallway for an hour.... when they called this class FUNDAMENTALS they were serious!  I realized that i have nothing interesting to say..... this sucks horribly because i hate blogging when i have nothing to say but then if i dont BLOG I feel like a piece of my life is missing. LOL GF! Its true though. Heather and I both decided that Blogging is way cool. Cooler than cold grass.  I just saw on the news some lady who stabbed her husband 200 times but claims she "had good reason".... im sure ya did ya psycho!! This is what she is telling the judge.... i wonder if she'll get out of that one?!?! People are so stupid.... stop killing your husbands/kids/boyfriends/mcdonalds employees.... YOU WONT WIN!  ok i tried to blog but im in pain and need to lay down. SORRY. BUt i promise i will come up with some good blogging acceptable material for yall.  P.S did yall get my web-postcard.... once again that music is HOT!  P.S.S dena i dont know if i wanna sell my camera because ....well i dont know... i told mike i would give it to him but i dont know if he wants it. Ill let you know  P.S.S.S suzanne good job on getting rid of your euro-smell.  P.S.S.S.S betsy where are you. are you alive.  P.S.S.S.S.S heather party with the psychos this summer !!    i am going.
