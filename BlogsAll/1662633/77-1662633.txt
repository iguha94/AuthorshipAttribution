         good morning, ya'll!  (morning for me, i just woke up!  rocks to be a supa-senia!)  So, I dreamt last night that I was in Houston, and Shawna took me to the mall with everyone from her school (Must have been high school), and we were all in this auditorium in the mall, and everyone was kinda milling around talking, waiting for something to start, so i was trying to find a good place to sit.  Well, suddenly, i was SINGLE!  So I start flirting with this Asian guy named "Tai Chi" (haha!), and then his girlfriend gets all pissy at me, so I go start flirting with GIRLS!  By the end of the dream, I hook up with this cute girl with a pixie hair cut, and Shawna's like, "Oh, so YA'LL are together now..." (surprised that i ended up with a chick),  And I'm like, "yep! guess so!"  LOL, it was so random! when i woke up, i was secretly wishing that i had hooked up with shawna in the end...  Oh, and the dream before last night, dena, shawna, and i were trying out for American Idol in Boulder!  Except i didn't really tryout cause I can't sing; i just wanted to sign up so i could hang out with everyone.  And I can't remember what Shawna sang, but dena sang "Holy, Holy, Glory"... IN SPANISH!!  So all day while she was waiting for her turn, she was practicing singing, "Holia, Holia, Gloria..."  It was hysterical!!  And they both were sure they'd make it because, quote, "Look around... our competition is nothing but a bunch of Boulder Hippies..."  haha!  Looks like i gotta stop reading this blog, and stop watching american idol...  but of course i'm not gonna!!  HOLLA - heather
