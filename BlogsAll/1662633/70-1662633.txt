         HOLLA......boobs are def. not offensive...i was all about janet's bood.....seriously...that is what made the half time good.....if i'm gonna watch a half time...i wanna a see a boob.   legalized prostitution sounds good too....i don't really have thoughts about it either way but it seems like then we wouldn't have to put so many people in jail for stupid things since they're always complaining about how there isnt' enough room in jail/prison anymore (sorry, i'm not pc about jail/prison, they're both the same to me)  here is a lovely poem for the day entitled:   "IT Wrote This"  Only six inches, and the length is far greater than the width, much more white than black, yet this phenomenal object  rules with black.  it tells the white and everyone else who wants to listen what it is thinking? how it is feeling? it will even agree on a transaction for you. Amazing!  it's tattoo on its body gives understanding and meaning to its life. it is remarkable that it can be put away for  a while, and then pulled out again for use, as if it were the first time. depending on your friendliness toward it, it could last a long time. one cannot argue its value for it is pricless.  it wrote this.  Andrew Karasnow (2/18/04)  well, i was just printing out my paper when i noticed a bunch of poems sitting on the printer and i saw "six inches" so this one just caught my attention. well, it's some guy's poem for a class about his weiner. thought i should at least share it w/ you all.
