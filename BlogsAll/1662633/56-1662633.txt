         whenever i go to blogger.com i always look to the left of the screen and hope to see that our blog has been either one of the most recent updated blogs or a blog to look out. sadly, it has never been. even when i publish and then rush back to the login page, were still not on there. perhaps one day...maybe, one day.  well that was uncalled for and rather boring but what are you gonna do? i want to see soo many movies but none of them are out here. i really really really want to see miracle and i really want to see the anti-semetic film about Jesus. besides, its lent, i think i should get to watch movies about God. so take that world. id fight about it but i dont understand what there is to fight about. its history. thats like saying a movie about the holocaust and WWII might show people with not quite kosher attitudes towards jews. haha. im funny--i said kosher.  school is hard. yup. i think its safe to say that everywhere school is hard. and i hate when people complain about it (all the americans do about LSE)...because NO SHIT its hard, its supposed to be. if it was easy they wouldnt make you qualify to get in, or it wouldnt be such a big thing to go to school. our generation is a bunch of slackers. i am thouroughly disillusioned. bah!  ok, i have to read about indians (dots not feathers). did you know that matt damon is two years older than ben affleck. is it just me or is ben getting worse looking as he gets older? all very important issues.  back to my ever so boring weekday life...the weeks half over...happy hump day!
