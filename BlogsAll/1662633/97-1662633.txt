         Dear Diary,  Please help.  I feel so left out right now.   All I ever do is try to be cool and fit in, and I thought I was until everyone went to the Annual Holla Blogga Get-Together in HTown without me.  True, I couldn't go since I had school this week, but STILL! They could have at least planned it for a time when ALL of us could be there... it's like they purposely planned it for the one week when I couldn't go.  They all say I'm their friend, but now I'm having major doubts.  What "friend" would do something like this to me?  And the worst part of all of this is that I think Shawna schemed the whole thing.  I know she's mad at me for stealing Robbie's heart...  it's not like it was MY fault he cheated on her!  And HE was the one to spill the beans so she found out!  He was like, "Wow, your cousin's a cutie.  i swear i've met her somewhere before... oh yeah, naked in bed with her, how could i forget?"  OMG, he can be such a dumbass sometimes!  So now she's all pissy at me, and I just know she said something to the other girls to make them all turn against me.  I don't know why she's still mad, though!  i mean, i GAVE HIM BACK to her...  and that wasn't easy, especially since i had already told my entire family that i finally met Mr. Right!  So of course i had to give g-ma the low-down on our relationship today.  she's like, "Vell, i tot dat you vould be trilled ven da two of you broke up."  i was like, "no, you stupid bitch!  i was MISERABLE when we f*cking broke up!!"  and then i bitch-slapped her across the face.  Oh, Diary, why does this always happen to ME????  What do I do??  Write back soon!  Loooooooove, Heather  p.s.  Do you think i'm pretty, Diary?  be honest!  circle:    YES     or     NO
