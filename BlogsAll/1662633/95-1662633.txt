         HOLLA....you know what's funny...i actually don't say y'all either..but sometimes i feel like maybe i might start saying it cuz it is A LOT EASIER....just like all you girls! (haha jk).   heather....don't feel like you're the only person to see snow....cuz yesterday i am in houston getting on the plane in a tank top and sandals enjoying the 77degree weather at 6am....and then as we start landing in indy, i notice blizzard like weather outside of the plane......:((( LAME. yes, it is colder here now than it was when i left for texas.   betsy, how did we not see eachother again???? well, i know how...i don't have a car over there....shawna's my ride. it's true...so whatever she does.....i do. and i just want to be like her cuz she's so cool w/ her beetle and mac. sorry i couldn't make rent.....i wanted to but again...the whole ride thing. did you like it?   sue, you so should have not gone back to london b/c you missed out on some good old galveston fun. (besides the fact that i was sick the whole time)....there was some good frisbee action...i have several scrapes from diving to catch the frisbee to prove it. good times good times.   shawna, thanks for the shoes....jaime will LOVE them...trust me. how's your sunburn coming along....my freakish looking spots went away.....don't use 'chapstick' sun block b/c it doesn't come on even and you get spots on your skin....it's true.  angela, good seeing you!
