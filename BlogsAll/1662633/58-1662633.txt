         i am writing because i would feel wretched if you jokers had to wake up another morning and not have your morning blog. far be it from me to deprive you of the one thing that makes your life worth living...the blogspot. holla!  shawna! nooooooooooooo. stop getting in car accidents. that sucks. i hope you feel better and your knee doesnt die...if it does happen to die, you can SUE SUE SUE (teehee, thats my name three times) the shit out of him for ruining your running career. it is an asset you know. did you end up getting a ticket or anything? i hope not, i hope they nailed that SOB for everything. for real mang. for real. it sucks that you had a bad day too. just think, its probably worse if you were living barefoot in a glass house and were throwing rocks...or something like that. no, itd be worse if you had to eat worms and dirt. yes, that would be worse. or placenta. thats pretty gross too.  sooooooo on out website for tshirts (well done dena on the wholesale site) , how are we going to diplay the shirts/designs/etc? do we mass produce. where are we going to screen print? how much does that cost?  whats the minimum number of shirts that you have to screen print at a time? i have lots more questions and some answers but ill wait til i hear some definites before i tell you what i think  my arm pits itch. that reminds me, for a while when i was here this summer i was noticing that i smelled REAL bad and i couldnt figure out why--i was showering everyday (yah! i know, odd) and wearing deoderant but i still smelled like a euro. turns out that the deo that i was using wasnt that at all. it was only anti-perspirant and TRUST ME, no anti perspirant in the world can stop me from sweating. so there i was, a sweaty mess, smelling like a foot everywhere i went. no wonder no one talked to me. luckilly i have that whole mess figured out. people dont have to steer clear because of my pits...now, its the shoes--im used to that, its always been the shoes.  late
