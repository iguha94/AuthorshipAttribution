         HOLLA.....yup....that sex scene in the lion king was a good one. haha. but how about in the little mermaid when the preacher has a boner during the wedding ceremony...or when alladin tells good teenagers to take off their clothes? what about the huge penis embedded in the castle on the picture on the box of the little mermaid? yes....those disney folks are way into sex...they might as well make a disney version of sex in the city. now that would be interesting.   right now i'm watching dirty dancing and it's at 1 out of 2 of the best parts....i think heather will agree. it's the part where they're in johnny's room and are dancing/have sex/ and of course you can see his butt if you pause it or put it in slow motion.  (the 2nd best part is the end when they're all dancing and the two old women drop off their little shawls, get together and start dancing)...haha.   hey, do you guys LOVE fritos bean dip? well, I DO. hey, maybe a fritos person will read this and send me a year's supply of frito's bean dip....that would be GRRRRREAT...you know like if oprah mentions a product she gets a crapload of it for free.   oh, my friend kristin said she knows TONS of guys who would buy the "i have cankles" shirt. so, SOMEBODY find a place where we're gonna make them. (ie: shawna, betsy...since you're both in h-town right now).  well, i guess that's all i have for the night........talk to Y'ALL manana  dena
