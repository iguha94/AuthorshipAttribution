         HOLLA  Hey yall...not much has been going on with me lately.  I'm still on my healthy kick, believe it or not.  I don't know if I mentioned this earlier, but since I've been dragging ass in soccer lately, I decided to eat healthy for the most part and drink moderately.  Yes, I've honestly become the responsible girl.  It's actually kinda fun.  Anyway, so yeah I've been kicking ass at being healthy.    We played U of H last night and lost 1-0.  Damnit.  Yay for Kelcee!  She'll be breaking 5 in no time...that's awesome.  Sue, don't you have anything interesting to say about Charlie the Australian??  I need suspense in my life.  Also, I love the t-shirt ideas...wonderful.  Shawna, I'm sorry about how awful you feel.  That's hilarious about the psychotic gay man though.  Oh I have a story myself about a schizo...first of all there's a serial killer on the loose at Rice Village so I've been fearing for my life for about a week or so.  Anyway, last Thursday I went home to Spring.  It was a 11 at night and I had to get gas.  I was pretty terrified b/c the killer last struck at the gas station right next to the one I was filling my gas up at.  Luckily there were lots of people around when I stopped and it was well lit, etc.  However, there was this one guy filling up his gas who was just jabbering away talking about I don't know what.  It was hilariously terrifying.  I don't mean to freak you out, but I wonder if the guy you were talking about is the killer!  I mean, he had no motive when he was shooting these women...that's the kind of thing crazy people do.  Was he white?  That's part of his description.  Also, is the store you were talking about anywhere near Rice?  Ok he's probably not the killer, but who the hell knows.
