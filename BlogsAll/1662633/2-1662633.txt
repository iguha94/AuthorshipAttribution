         Ok so this was the longest day ever.  First of all i go to sleep then wake up 5 seconds later. I got about 1 HOUR of sleep last night because ...well i dont know why i just couldnt sleep. SO i sleep from 6 to 7 am then get up to go to work where i was untill 3 pm. Work sucked as usual... mainly because the first two hours i was there i was forced to mop, sweep, vacuum and clean the windows and mirrors..... so app. i am a janitor. well then i get off work and have to turn in my books for school. Well the place i usually turn in athletic books has a note saying "go to bookstore".... by the way i am carrying at least 10 books in this bag that is ripping and very heavy.  So i go to the bookstore...wait in line for 15 miutes.... "oh sorry but you need to take those to the 'textbook line' ".... WTF?! So i go to the 'text book line' where the lady tells me... "athletic books are turned in at the alumni center" . HOLY SHIT i was pissed.... so i had to walk back to my car and drive to the alumni center where i finally found the guy and he's like...the turn in date isnt until tomorrow... (i almost started cussing...) But then he was like "buut i will take yours now for you". So i finally got that straightened out... now all i wanna do it sleep but i am suppose to go back to klein.... BLAH.
