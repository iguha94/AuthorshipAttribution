         as normal, i should be writing a paper, so...again, this is gonna be a short blog, as in REAL short but hey, at least im blogging. im confused, are they koalas or not? they look like koalas, what the hell else would they be? so, really that statement should be the be-all and the end-all of the koala question: if sue thinks theyre koalas, they are.  soooo saturday was DATE NIGHT ( i love the new sue) and i went out with charlie and we went to the most posh most great place for dinner and it turns into a club...and it was super classy and was great. needless to say, he managed to get me drunk and we stayed and danced until 2p and THEN i finally got to go see his house. which was amazing. it was a four or five story in south kensington. holy balls! lame tongue was on the couch when we walked in. would have been awkward but lame tongue was really drunk and i dont think he recgnised me. oh well, i LOLed about the whole situation. anyway, im no slut. just thought id throw that out there--i was on period. haha, well done me.  oh and by the way, i am WEIRD. i cant, for the life of me sleep past 8 am...(which isnt a good thing when your not sleeping by yourself). every damn day, even when i get in at 3 or 4...i think thats lame on my part...and it really chaps my ass because im always really really tired come monday--its monday and im tired but now i have to write the dreaded paper on japan.  betsy, you rule.
