         HOLLA Ok so let's face it, I've had a pretty lousy (I like the word lousy) couple of weeks.  Valentine's Day sucked.  I sprained my ankle and I've been having problems with my SI joint (lower back-ish).  My team has been having awful practices.  And most of all, I am missing Mardi Gras.  Sue knows how I feel.  But then again, maybe she doesn't b/c it means a lot more to me then just going out and getting shitfaced...it's been a big family tradition and I've gone almost every year since I've been really little.  Then this Saturday we had to wake up at 5am and go to hell on earth aka College Station to play a bunch of games.  Ok I think I've set the stage...with me feeling down and all, I figured something good has got to happen sooner or later...you know karma and shit.  Well, we played A&M 11v11 (full field game) and we beat them 1-0!!  For those of you who don't know (most of you), A&M has one of the best soccer teams in the nation.  Not to mention, I played with a bunch of the girls on the team when I was younger and it was nice to knock them the fuck off their high horse!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  Hold on gotta work...man people suck.  Anyway, so yeah it was one of the best moments of my life without a doubt.  Gig em.  On a sadder note, my frog, Nelson, passed away.  Rest in peace buddy.  Out.
