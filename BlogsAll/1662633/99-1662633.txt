         HOLLA so now i actually have some time to write to my fellow bloggies.....man...that sounds like some kind of documentary (eg: trekkies----wow, that dentist was crazy). sue/betsy...have ya'll seen HOHB: hands on a hard body? i know heather is in the club of viewers....actually she has all their autographs and is the president of the HOHB fan club....i know b/c i wanted to be prez. but just couldn't compete.   well, sorry, but these are the kinds of things i say when i haven't slept at all.  i'm so mad...i went to this yum breakfast place at 6:30 to get some pancakes before my test this morning but they don't open til 7:00---JERKS.....now i know how the old people feel who want to get to those buffets bright and early in the morning and the place is CLOSED (you know like on southpark.....the one where the old people were killing everyone cuz they couldn't drive). well, it was funny so i suggest watching it if you get a chance.   oh, if any of you ever watch the dave chapelle show.....the E true hollywood story part is hillarious...and every time he goes into a club....there's that same black guy dancing the 'robot' with his huge eyes rolled to teh back of his head.....it's hillarious. watch it.....YOU'LL LIKE IT.   heather, where are you? i haven't heard any good stories about the "mean hussinas" or anything lately.  well, i honestly have nothing to say and am obviously babbling so i'll end this now.  i'm gone like RPW's blogsite, dena
