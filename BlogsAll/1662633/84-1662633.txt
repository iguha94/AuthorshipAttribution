         so i just posted and then i read what everyone blogging about and i will have you know that sue leads an anything but boring life. maybe you losers are stuck in a rut but ill tell you this much--ummm,...i'm....not...boring (riiiight, i said that already). well, im not, so there. IN FACT, im so involved with leading my incredibly fantastic life that i dont have time to blog. but i do anyway because i heart my sistas :)  let me sum up my date for you (to prove how wonderfully im doing) and i am going to do it in statistics because that way its quantifiable and thats how we economic historians do it (maybe i am boring...)  stats on charlie: age:25 job: investment banker home:south kensington (£££) origin:australia (yum) sports: crew and rugby stats on the date: first bar: glass of wine restaurant: shot, big thing of beer, mussels, chicken, beer, coffee second bar: amaretto total units of alcohol I consumed last night: 10  so not only was my date alcolically satisfying, the guy is perfect and i may have a valentine for the first time in my entire life (excluding michael snyder in 1st grade...his mom made him give me a card). boring my ASS.  also, drumroll please, i think that i will be staying in london for the rest of my life (ie, finishing school here) soooooo, everyone SAVE money OR well make all the money with the HOTees and you can come and party this summer here with me!  not, i must get back to my work. laaaaaaaaaaate
