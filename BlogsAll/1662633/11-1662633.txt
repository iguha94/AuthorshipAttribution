         HOLLA i'm just wondering where all the blog love is....nobody writes in here anymore....i'm just wondering if it's b/c you guys's lives right now are just as uneventful as mine. well, that's when you start making up stories like having the biggest penis in the world. betsy...i know you have the biggest dildo in the world...let's hear about it.   to answer your comment about stripping heather.....i have stripped many times....let me say, it feels soo good when you rip off your clothes and that music is blaring......and then of course you get in the shower to get ready for the day. haha. ok, so i've never gotten payed to strip, but i def. always do it for my professors to get an A...we're talking even the girl teachers...at least the hot ones.   but seriously...i went to a female stripper strip club in south padre ( with a group of girls that were deff lesbians) and to get in for free we told the bouncer we were thinking of stripping there and just wanted to see the place. he said we could all make a grand in a night...so i seriously considered...thinking...if only i was gonna be in s. padre for one more night. but then i realized i would have to be pretty drunk and there were only about 10 men in the strip club, so obviously this $1000 was all a front....i know he just wanted to see me naked...haha. jk.  so anyways, sue's mom is awesome! i think we should take her out to a resteraunt and get her trashed on martinis and white russians....now that would be funny.   late.dena  ps: the snow penis will be coming your way pretty soon! --- so keep an eye out
