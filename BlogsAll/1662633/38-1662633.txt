         SUP. Well i finished my first day of school. Here are some of my accomplishments: -I went to all my classes showed up EARLY and STAYED the whole time -I took notes -I FINISHED MY HOMEWORK -Started studying ALREADY  wow i am soooo smart its not even funny.  Anyway i had my art class... its 5:30 pm - 8:30 .... which absolutely sucks considering its TWICE a week. But i hope i will be busy the whole time. My art prof's name is LUC .. not LUKE ....but LUC ... art people are wierd... why the hell dont you just spell it LUKE and stop trying to be unique... i want to be an art major but im not changing my name to shakna (with a silent k of course) or anything queer like that. GEEZ another reason why i hate people. He also stutters... 3 hours with a stuttering prof... NOT GOOD. Oh well its better than being in a history lecture.   I also biked today and i feel soooooo bootylicious again...i did and average of 65 RPM for 30 mins. but i went 80 RPM for 5 minutes... THATS CRAZY FAST just so you know and then i did crazy abs with a 12 lb medicine ball. man i am ripped.   Ok well i have to bed myself early since i have class at 9am!! And i have NO IDEA why i just said "bed myself" ... it means go to bed but its cooler to say "bed myself" so SAY IT AND LIKE IT.  P.S ... sex in the "shower" instead of city because dena has sex in the shower... GET IT?!?!! Ok thats all.  HOLLA
