         sup PLAYETTES...and...PLAYETTEs.....yeah anyway i am currently sitting in the athletic computer lab doing HOMEWORK before my women's studies class.  Yes i am using my free time to do homework.... well right now im not because im bloggin' but i WAS doing it i swear. Im such a studious person, it reminds me of that time betsy had sex with miss johnson during 4th period sex education class back in highschool.    So i wrote a tearful letter to the Director of Financial Aid about keeping my scholarship... it's two pages and very touching i must say. I have to go turn in it before friday or else i am SCREWED.   I am typing on the CUTEST computer right now.... its A MAC of course but its BRIGHT PINK...... pink is a great color... its kind of like the color of shelly and betsy's double sided vibrator.   I did my workout today and probably did EVERY POSSIBLE crunch position there is to do.  I did it with the medicine ball, i did it with the pilates ball, i did it with free weights and i did it with my own self.  IT meaning crunches not sex like sue. Wow my abs hurt and i just laughed at the guy who walked in because he tripped over ABSOLUTELY nothing and it made my tummy hurt. But very funny. He is looking at me because he knows i am making fun of him. OMG i just winked at him... i dont even know why it just sporadically happened....now he thinks i want to cyber sex him up like betsy & c.blood ! OH WELL - man im such a heartbreaker.... lol.  ok well i must go to my class i guess but i expect some good blogs later because i have no life and this is what i look forward to every day.  SOON TO COME: MISS JOHNSON STORIES...DUN DUN DUN.  HOLLA
