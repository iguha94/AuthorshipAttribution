         my (social) commentary on shanababas pictures 1. i loooooove how drunk you are--the one where youre leaning on anglea gave it away. sober people just arent that happy 2. people! 1. i, not ashton kutcher, started the trucker hat phenom ( i sported it as part of my mechanic costume and then to numerous white trash bashes--i am white trash (well my neighbors were) so there was nothing wrong with that). 2. i did it as a joke and because i look cute in hats 3. stop with the trucker hat thing already! youre all a bunch of trust fund babies, stop trying to look like white trash, youre not! 3. i dont think naked boy needed a sock quite that big. nice try though 4.stephen moreno still needs to cut his hair. take a hint stephen...your brothers hot, he has short hair...youre related to your brother, you share the same genes, you do the math 5. shawna , take off the hat!(although you do look cute...get a real hat!) 6. it pisses me off that all the girls seem to be wearing look at my boobies shirts and i havent seen a guy in anything but a t-shirt--not even a collared shirt. write about that in your clit class. this is my theory...we make guys buy us dinner because in the long run, clothes and shoes and purses that we (most demonstrably shown in pics of shawnas party) use to "impress" boys are probably equal to the money they spend on girls. so a little money for dinner before guys get any is just away of balancing the check book--not prostitution at all.  7. one mardi gras bead? betsy, youre with my on this one... 8. i cant concentrate on my paper...damn the blog
