         HOLLA so I went to opening ceremonies for the Super Bowl yesterday.  I must say it was quite fun.  Yanni performed and boy did he make me wet.  That mullet, that mustache, and those tight leather pants.  What a composer!  Today I coached a game for Kinkaid...that high school I've been coaching for a few months.  Anyway, it was technically a JV 2 game, meaning the JV 1 girls weren't really supposed to play, much less start.  Well, oops I started a lot of the JV 1 girls b/c if I didn't (and virtually all the JV 2 girls play the same position), there would've been mass chaos.  I tried to get all the JV 2 girls in the game, but there were 76 on the sideline, and there were 30 min halves, making it nearly impossible.  In sum, I didn't get all the girls in the game, and a lot of the girls were pissed.  But hey we won!  So fuck em.  But here's something cool...apparently the varsity coach wants to hire me for good after I graduate (and work in the art dept simultaneously) or something, so if I end up going to U of H (cougars suck!) to get my masters, I'll have a way to pay for it.  Kinkaid is probably the ritziest (sp?) school in Houston, so it would probably pay pretty well.  Wow I just realized how boring this blog is.  I am tired.  Oh and Sue I'm learning how to weld and it's kinda hard so it's gonna take a while to make it but no worries friend!  I'll have it done by the end of the semester.  Oh and Shawna, I'll probably go home at some point this weekend and I still have that Miss Johnson story you wrote me on that dry erase board, plus I always save everyone's notes...so I'll get one and rewrite it on the blog next week.  That one was pretty good, but you didn't really incorporate dildos.  Let's work on that.
