         HOLLA...so do any of you guys watch friends? well, there's an old one where this guy at work always called chandler the wrong name..and it got too late for chandler to tell him that he was being called the wrong name. well, chandler's boss goes up to chandler and is like "we're thinking of bringing (Jeff--guy who doesn't know chandler's name) up to our floor to help lighten our work load".....chandler says no...(knowing that this will cause problems since jeff doesn't know his name). later, jeff sees chandler and is like...."i didn't get a promotion b/c of this guy chandler bing...have you heard of him?"....so chandler says no, and proceeds to help jeff destroy 'chandler's' office in revenge..........WELL.....(here's where i come into the story)..........   i'm in the chem. computer lab right now and had to print out 40 pages worth of articles to read........well, the computer is messed up and only prints about a page/minute...so that's a good 40 mins. of my stuff printing. so i'm just typing a paper and i hear all these people complaining saying "who is the person printing out like 50 pages of stories?....that's so annoying". of course i didnt want to claim responsibility for them not being able to print out their 1 page of an assigment that's due in a few minutes...so i joined in and was like "i dont know...what were they thinking....that's so inconsiderate". well, then after about 10 mins.......a guy is like...i'm just gonna cancel their print job b/c it's taking so long and there's nobody even standing over there to get the stuff coming out.  so knowing that if i go over there and collect the articles....i'll get caught......i simply suggest "yeah, you SHOULD go cancel teh print job.....that person shouldn't be printing out so much stuff anyways"...hahaha.....THAT'S HOW COOL I AM  alright...gotta run
