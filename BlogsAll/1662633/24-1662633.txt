         FINALLY THE WEEKEND woo hoo!! After a WEEK FULL OF MORNING-NIGHT CLASSES i am just going to eat and sleep until monday morning. except saturday because i have to work the High School indoor meet at UH.... there are 1250 people entered to compete!!!! Guess what my job is?? TO type ENTRIES into the computer!!! WTF??? that should be fun. i have to work 11 am - 10 pm.... thats just plain queer.  I am a professional "line drawer" ... yes its true!  Last night I had my drawing class... first of all i got in trouble because i brought the wrong paper!!!! So LUC already hates me.... then he tells us we are doing a line variation excersize... sounds interesting right??? Nope pretty much had to just DRAW LINES FOR 3 HOURS... no joke... i have 6 pages (19 inch paper) front and back of lines!!!! I know this is an introduction to drawing class but come on... we arent in kindergarten! So i have 6 pages of signed line drawings.... so if anyone wants to buy one just ask.  Oh yeah we also got to graduate to circles triangles and squares after an hour and a half... so i have plenty of those too.   well its about that time again -- time to eat that is... i havent eaten yet today and thats just not acceptable. Sooo sorry this blog was short and boring but surprisingly yes i have run out of anything to say! Just wait till later though.. i will probably have some interesting news... maybe someone will splash blue paint on my car today.  HOLLA
