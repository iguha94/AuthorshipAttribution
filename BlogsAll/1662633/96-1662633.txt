         HOLLA Heather, don't be sad.  I actually saw Sue once, and I didn't see Dena or Shawna at all!  This is mostly due to the fact that I am also out of spring break.  Awwww fuck it...hold on E true Hollywood Story's on...ok well, one good thing to come out of this is that Beer Bike was this weekend!!  This is my favorite holiday...Rice holiday that is.  The whole campus starts drinking at 8am and there's a school-wide water balloon fight and then there's a huge bike race.  This year I was one of the bikers...we (Martel, my college) came in fourth, which is really good for us b/c we're the newest college.        Other news...I'm on a healthy kick.  That's right folks.  I've been dragging ass in practice and it's time to put in the commitment.  So I've decided to eat healthy and drink, yes it's true, moderately.  I'm now the responsible girl.  At least for a good six months.  Shit.      More news that you won't care about, well Sue might care b/c she's getting one...I finished my series with the steel/welding pieces.  I made four of them Sue so you get to take your pick.  I'm really excited b/c tomorrow I'm starting a new piece...I think it's gonna be made out of wood and it's definitely gonna be huge.  Hopefully it'll end up looking phallic.      That is all.
