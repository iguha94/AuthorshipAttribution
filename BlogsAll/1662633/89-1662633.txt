         HI.  I have little time to type this blog but since i have not in awhile i figured i should at least time a little somthin somthin. Anyway i have approx. 3 minutes.  Heather you have any luck with the webpage thing. I think we should stick to hot colors.... pink, orange, red.... those kinds of things. I SAY PINK bc its my favorite color. But just do whatever you like.... you are the web design genius.  what are yall doin for valentines day? Im going to stay at this hotel in the woodlands all weekend and strut around like im rich and spend  lots of money. Its gonna be great. Mike won 2 nights stay from a race he did... You guys are jealous. Actually i dont know what there is to do in the woodlands but hey im sure we can find something.   Ok well i am in the process of getting photoshop and other graphic design software so yall post what you want your personal shirt to say ... and if you have any design ideas tell me. OR you can design it yourself..... whatever you choose.   i need to shave my arms and legs. Just thought i would tell you that.   i finally changed my belly button ring... after over a year of the same one ... katie bought me some for xmas and i was afraid to change it cause i thought it would hurt. Not at all. But it was stuck in there at first.. haha i guess it was attached to my  stomach or something.   Ok well i have women's studies. I get to write an essay about babies who are born with penis' shorter than 0.6 centimeters.... in that case the penis is amputated and they create a makeshift vagina.... and turn the boy into a female. This is in order to be socially accepted.. because apparantley 0.6 centimeters is abnormal for babies... poor babies with their tiny dicks. Oh well. GOTTA GO.  gone like a 0.6 centimeter penis  HOLLA
