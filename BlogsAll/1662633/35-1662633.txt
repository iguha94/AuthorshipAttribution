         Well here i am .... just got back from my classes and im hot doggin' it up w/my james coney island... MMM MMM MMMM. Im sorry but no matter how many times someone tells me what hot dogs are made of i will always love them!   Today i had Hotel & Restaurant Management class and Sociology....  Both classes sound easy. My HRM prof said...and i quote "I will give you the EXACT exam one week before you take it to study off of" ... so i have a feeling i will be acing that class. If i dont i give you all permission to take me out back with the guy that sue third wheeled with and shoot me. And my sociology prof looks, acts, and talks like Dave Chapelle.... its kind of scary yet it kept me amused.  The highlight of my morning was when Shayne (my prof) asked "Why do we go to college?" and the thug sitting next to me says "Because my highschool teachers left a lot of shit out" ...interesting..one of the perks of going to UH i guess. The not-so-much-a-highlight of my day...: Going to my car and having a parking ticket.... i was parked at a meter and i paid for 1 hr and a half...and i was 3 MINUTES LATE...and the guy gave me a ticket.... stupid guys in their gay little golf carts... GET A REAL JOB your a middle-aged man who orgasms when he gets to put tickets on cars that are THREE MINUTES past their meter time!!! once again I HATE PEOPLE. Which is why im becoming an artist...so i can wear dark clothes and express my hatred with ART and make no money. Well actually i am going to be in advertising so i guess i have to learn to like people. Damnit.   Well i need to write a letter to the President of Financial Aid about my scholarship... time to work my Bullshitting magic :) !!!!   Oh yeah and i have Women's Studies tonight... i get to learn about a bunch of lesbians... CANT WAIT!  Sue why wait till saturday to get the booty.... "just do it" as nike would say! HOLLA
