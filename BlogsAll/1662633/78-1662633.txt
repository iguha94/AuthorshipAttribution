         HOLLA y'all............i'm am done w/ this crazy week finally! now it's time to RELAX. my test had 8 questions and i def. didn't finish b/c there was so much writing...but i can say now that i know how to draw the chemical sequence of many of the molecular processes that are occuring inside you and me...haha jk (well, i really can draw them, but i'm POSITIVE none of you care).  well, news on the hot guy.....he's definately not gay.....always a positive....so sue you should come here and meet him. he's the one w/ a really good job in NYC lined up. oh, another plus....he came swimming w/ me and some of my friends for a workout....and def. said he thought i had an awesome body.....so he's not picky! well, anyays, i made sure he knew we could only be friends, but i did mention my hot friends (that being you guys), and told him he should talk to the single ones. but sue, now you have a valentine...so i guess that won't work out...unless it is just a fling for v-day.  either way....GO SUE.   yesterday i was walking on campus and this guy (who i took a few mins to recognize) walked by. after thinking for a minute i realized he was my AI for a class i took 1st semster my freshman year. well, when he walked by he goes "hey dena, how's it going?"....how did he remember my name? i didn't even know he was my AI. anyways, i thought that his memory was so impressive that it was worth mentioning on here.   our computer lab 'technicians' are all indian....that seems to be the majority of minorities around here.   wow, i've noticed that almost every other blog on here is from me....where do i find the time? i'm just such a good friend. jk  well, i'm gonna go take a nap
