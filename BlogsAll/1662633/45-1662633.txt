         Making t-shirts with iron on transfers is the BEST! Here's a funny story...  So Jeff (my 24 year old brother) and his best friend Joe made these t-shirts for their Halloween costumes this year.  Jeff has this really pimp digital camcorder, and the plan was to wear these t-shirts and go around to all the bars and house parties videoing the whole time.  Well, here is what they put on the shirts:      And they even made   CONSENT FORMS!   Pretty funny... and every girl thought they were really Girls Gone Wild film crew guys, and were all excited and into it and totally participated.  haha! girls are dumb... **except the olsen twins, of course!**  Anyway, Dena, I was reading your drunken blog this morning, and Daniel was over here so he wanted to read it too... and I was so glad that he did cause boys are dumb, too, when it comes to lame jealousy issues...  they seriously make an issue out of absolutely nothing.   They get all defensive and pull that if-another-guy-so-much-as-talks-to-my-girl-then-she's-messing-around-behind-my-back attitude!! WTF?  So, yeah, I was glad daniel read it, cause now he knows i'm not the only girlfriend who has strictly platonic relationships with the opposite sex.  all right, everyone send me your favorite pictures of yourselves cause i wanna make a fun banner to go at the top of this blog!  my email is heathercapri@hotmail.com.
