         i wussed out on riding the mechanical bull... but damn! you really can get turned on watching people ride those things -- guys AND girls!    Memorable events from tonite: 1. Two short latino thugs coming right up next to us to "dance," but they were really just taking pictures of our boobs with their camera phones, and we didn't know until it was too late... 2. My poor feet getting stepped on A MILLION TIMES by the girl wearing 5" stillettos during the "BULL-SHIT" line dance, which i pretty much suck at... 3. 80's dancing to the LAMEST song i have ever heard, and having homeboy come up and be like, "damn! you've got some MOVES! mind if i just stand here and watch for a while?" umm, helloooo???  I was JOKE-80's dancing, not cool/modern 80s dancing.  I looked like molly ringwald from the breakfast club meets FLASHDANCE!  I swear, guys and their lines nowadays...  aiiight, g's... time for beddy-bye.  I'm really surprised no one's blogged since my last blog... that never happens anymore...  damn, my hair smells like nasty bar smoke...  i hate that!  I get so spoiled in boulder cause it's illegal to smoke inside any and every public building, including bars, so when we venture into denver, we come home reeking of smoke. it sucks!  okay, g'night! read ya' tomorrow! (get it? instead of SEE YA tomorrow?!)
