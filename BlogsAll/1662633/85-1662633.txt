         again, my deepest apologies for being MIA since thursday but in my defense NO ONE has seen/talked to me...i'm an equal oppurtuinity ignorer.  heather, i thought the temporary website was kickass and, hey, as long as none of the font is new times roman, then i think its great. i hate new times roman. needless to say i am pleased that our blog is arial or something...anyway...  i have been ever so busy latley. the parents came and i went to scotland and ran. i got 100th-ish and there were 400 runners, my team got 7th (it was the british universities championships). i was psyched because i got dadyy to buy me new spikes for it. on saturday i went out with cathy (mom). we got tanked and danced all night at the Long Island Ice Tea House. it was good fun. then we had a mother-daghter bonding moment of drunk munchies on the way home and decided to split a pizza and watch bridget jones until 230. on Sunday, i met up with maggie (from KHS) who is at oxofrd and we saw a play with mummy and daddy. good fun (as this is the really boring part of my blog , im now Fast FOrrwarding til last night)  i went on the best date ever!!!! charlie is fantastic. not to mention i pre-dated (ie. got some wines in me to loosen up) with the beer man (hot norwegian) and my friend liza and then was the moment of truth--i had to meet charlie at the covent garden tube stop and, honestly, i had no idea waht he looked like--i knew he looked british. luckily he was late and had to look for me and recognized me...tragedy averted. anywho, went to a bar, nice restaruant, another bar, had some kissy kissy and it was absolutley fabulous and i have to dry my hair but iwill write something later and redeem myself for this horrible blog  hotees rule all--tshirt ideas to come...
