         Sue, I'm so relieved that he fits in category A!  That means you have my approval (as if you need my approval) to allow him to be the first to punch your ol' V-card. haha!  But on the serious side of things, I'm glad you're doing it for you, and not for anyone else.  Now, I need to get a few things straight, here.  Who knows who in this little blog??  And how do you all know each other?  I'm so confused.  Sue, it sounds like you've never really met me or Angela, right?  But you know Betsy?  And Betsy, who do you know?  (I think I may have had a short but HOT AND WET email-affair with you once... I could be wrong...) Do all of you know both Dena and Shawna, or just Shawna?  And Sue, I thought you went to Tulane, but now you live in England are are studying law??  But you're seeing a guy who's from New Orleans, but went to CU, and now I'm assuming lives in England, too, since you're currently seeing him...  please straighten things out for me, would ya?  So tonite I'm goin' out with my girls to our favorite Wed-night hangout -- The Stampede.  It is THE PLACE TO BE on a Wednesday night...  It's usually a country bar, but Wed nights are ladies' nights (translation: HIP HOP night!) so they play 4 or 5 hip hop songs, then 4 or 5 fun country line dance type songs where everyone makes absolute FOOLS of themselves as the make up their own moves to the line dances that all the regulars seem to know, and then they play more hip hop, etc. etc.  And this place gets PACKED!  It's so fun!  maybe we'll ride the mechanical bull tonite... i've never done it.  it looks kinda hard!  Yee-Haw!  I mean, Yee-HOLLA! Heather
