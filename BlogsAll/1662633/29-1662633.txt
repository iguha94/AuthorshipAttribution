         HOLLA FOLKS!  first off i would like to say.....yes, the day we saw c. bloodworth in those small blue shorts/speedos was the best day ever.....mmmmm. it was pretty FREKIN HOT. and sue, does anyone actually know about the sober slut day besides c. blood, us, and the whole klein swim team? that was sooo funny. i'll let you tell the story...cuz i think you'd tell it better than me...you know my stories ("i've never been to new braunfels before").    on another note we should have FSO meetings again....this summer? heather if you come to houston...you can come to them.....they involve eating. (actually that's all they are pretty much).   so, yesterday when i was walking to class, i look up and watch a car back into a guy on a bike. the guy got knocked out, so naturally, i decide to go watch. well, about 50 people swarm around to watch the unconscious guy, but of course nobody does anything. i watched for a while but then had to go to class. it was very interesting...i think someone called the ambulance eventually, so it was a happy ending.  um.....feminists ARE annoying...i have run into a lot of them here in bloomington seeing as this town consists of lesbians, hippies, feminists, normal students and jewish people. the bloomington slogan is: "come out and play" and i am not kidding, the reason for this slogan is to attract gay people. here is the website if you don't beleive me:  http://www.indystar.com/articles/6/105436-5646-009.html  so anyways, ummmmmm....i don't have any exciting news. i am the captain of the basketball team (intermural b-ball that is). our team is gonna lose so bad (but i know you guys prob don't care...therefor, i'm gonna stop writing).  late
