         Ok guys HOLLA here is the deal...I can't really think of anything to say but I'm just gonna keep on a typin'.  Oh yes, Heather asked how we all know each other.  Well I think everyone pretty much covered it.  Yep.  Ok I don't think I threw up that night b/c the only night I ever threw up (I actually threw up the next morning but it turns out that I really had a virus so it shouldn't count) was New Year's two years ago when I got completely shitfaced at the Frenchs' house and made out with Sue's brother.  Sorry Sue.  Please do your research on tampons...you could do it on tampon fetish and perhaps its objectification of women?  I can think of some great websites to help you out with that one.  Or maybe that tampons are wonderful for women b/c they enable them to do things that the normal maxi simply wouldn't allow them to do.  At any rate, I cherish my tamps.  I think we should all celebrate our tampons and have a parade for those who wear maxis.  We could throw it out to them and they could stick em in their vages, right there on the street.  I'm sorry.  Ok I kinda have to pee but I think I'm gonna hold it.  My life sucks right now b/c I freakin night class almost every day of the damn week.  Ok supes and toods losers!
