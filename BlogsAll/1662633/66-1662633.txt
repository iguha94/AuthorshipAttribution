         so, long time no blog, i know.  reason for this:  I've had the most productive week ever!!  I've been go go go and lovin' it!  Not that i didn't have time for ya'll, but, well, i didn't...  LOL TTYL STAY SWEET SISTAS!!  Real quick... Poll issues:  is janet's boob offensive? yes. Should we legalize prostitution? no.  okay, so i really just wanted to say opposite of what everyone else has been saying.  but honestly, i don't care about janet's boob... But prostitution is gross and dirty... but even more, it's a PATHETIC EASY WAY OUT of life... Come on, if you're broke and need money, GET A JOB.  how hard is it to get a job???  work at the frickin' gap, or bag groceries, or sell shit on eBay, or something!!  Don't be so frickin' lazy!!  THAT REALLY CHAPS MY ASS!! (haha shawna) Plus, have a little respect for yourself!  I know i wouldn't want to fall in love with me and marry me and sleep with me if i knew i had been around the block more times than the number of viewers exposed to janets nasty boob at the halftime show!!  So in conclusion, Pony Up, girls, get a real job, and show yourself a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T...  So, i've noticed a trend that the longer we wait between our own respective blogs, the longer and longer they get!!  and i personally don't like the supa long long long ones, 'cause it seems like there's too much catching up to do all at once.  So i'm boycotting long blogs and encourage ya'll to do the same.  Let's raise the standards here and blog frequently so that we aren't forced to write a novel each time we post...  Dena's got the right idea -- she'll post twice in the SAME HOUR if she has to!  Anything to prevent that novel from forming!!  (now, i realize i'm just as guilty of long-blogging as everyone else, and please know that novel-blogging is waaaaayyyy better than no-blogging, but you guys see what i'm sayin' here...)  Having said that, more to come SOON!  ...and, i'm spent.
