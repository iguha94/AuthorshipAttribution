         this has been a long ass day. So i woke up at 11 am... then decided that i had a craving for los cucos. Called up jill and we decided to go. Me jill and gina went to Los Cucos and had a grand ole time.... despite the fact that we had a little klein reunion with people that arent exactly.....well our friends.... and they kept STARING AT US... what the hell.... but dont worry jilly stared back for us. We of course gave our fake waves... but we just left if at that.   Well after lunch i had to leave because i had to be at work. SO i drove downtown and went straight to my job where i stayed until 10:30 pm.... ewwwwww!!! But i decided to be a rebel and took a 30 minute break instead of my normal 15 minute break.. hehehe im soo sneaky.  OH yeah so as im leaving the galleria this tall man walks up to me and say "can i ask you a question?" i said yeah of course... and he goes " i just wanted to say you are very attractive" (in my head im thinking... that wasnt a question but...ok) Anyway so i say thank you and try to walk away... buut then he keeps goin... "yeah so you have a boyfriend" luckily i really do (i would lie and say yes anyway) and i say yeah.. and he goes.. yeah you might be too young for me anyway, so i follow with "well yah im 19" (this guy look 30 somthin) and he goes.. "oooh maybe not" (ok so i am freaking out bc he has a striking resemblance to the "galleria rapist" i saw on the news) So THANKFULLY my phone rings and i answer it and quickly walk away... pheew! But when i was leaving the parking lot i saw him Following and talking to some OTHER lady... GEEEZ HE'S A WHORE! Just be happy that i got away everyone! ;) !!Ok well Yall get excited BAR houston tomorrow night... dena and angela you are BOTH coming!!!! Ok well i gotta go to bed... i have to work tomorrow morning... AGAIN. Late! (no r angie! )  -shawna
