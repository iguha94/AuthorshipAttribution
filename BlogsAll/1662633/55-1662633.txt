         i dont think we will EVER be recognized for our blogging talents. Who knows maybe we will one day be discovered AND become the most famous bloggers to ever blog.  today i was parking at school and i was listening to "I Believe in a Thing Called Love" by the Darkness... you know the song that goes " I BELIEVE IN A THING CALLED LOOOOOOOOVE " .... haha ok that didnt describe it at all.... they sound like Queen. Anyway so as im parking the cool guitar solo comes on and this guy walking by my car starts doing the air guitar... i thought it was just a coincidence that he was doing it the same time as the song but then i got out of the car and he was singing the words too!! But the strange thing is i didnt have my stereo up really loud.... so im a little freaked out... plus WHO WALKS AROUND PLAYING THE AIR GUITAR?! LOL.  yesterday one of the baseball players walked up to me and said "i wanna say thanks to coming to our game friday.... i really appreciate it"  and then walked off. 1. This is completely random 2. How did he know i was there? baseball game = 2500 fans 3. Wierd.  anyway so i just thought that was odd because i dont even really know him....and yeah people are strange.  The C-USA indoor meet is this weekend... it is taking place at UH like usual since we are the only school with a friggin indoor track.... this sucks for the reason that I HAVE TO WORK at it..... uggh! I get a free tshirt but i bet anything it will fit me like a poncho. I hate Poncho fitting shirts.   umm im gonna do some studying... i got a mid-term next week which is gonna kick my ass if i dont study hard... its next friday and  miss studious 2004  started studying yesterday! thank you thank you.    im off to see the wizard.  HOLLA
