         Did I tell everyone about my band's BLog? It's at   stranglebox.blogspot.com . I thought I would just point you in that direction, as I'm going to make this a quick post about said band.   Bitter , or my band's album, as some of you know, has undergone massive changes since the   TinHaven  BLog. There's two musical pieces now, one purely acoustic ( Goodbye My Friend ) and the other a full-set piece with accompanying piano ( The Color Black ).  These Chains  has been scrapped in favour of a new song  Sweetly Forgotten , which was more complete from its conception than  Chains . Also, the song  Deadgone  has been scrapped in favour of a song meant to go on the next one, and which has also been written since seventh grade,  Rage . It was strange using this song, since back then it was only a vision, I was expecting the lady at the Country Music Hall of Fame to take the lyrics and bend them to music, and suddenly it's a reality, in fact,  my  reality.  So that is the update, despite your unconcern :).   And briefly, as for yesterday, it was like slipping through a dream somehow. Time marched on, we had fun at the mall, sans de movie, and Zoe didn't show after some poor planning. But after it was over, everyone was taken home and the punishments were passed out for being so late, I was left sitting in the passenger seat of a car with my mother driving for what seemed like hours, listening to the song  Full Colour Is The Night  and lapsing into sleep, waking to  Ten Miles High , falling back asleep, waking to  Between Times  and sitting up, turning off the blasting CD player. I asked my mom if I had been snoring, because I had the vaguest impression that I had, and she said otherwise.  As I came home I went to my room, hit the pillow, and knew no more.
