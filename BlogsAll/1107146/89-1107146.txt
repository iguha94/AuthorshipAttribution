         Jeez, this new BLog thing is really screwed up. Rosie had said she deleted that post, now that I recall...but of course, the new BLog is dumb. It deletes one out of every three of my posts whilst being dumb.  And in case Abby reads this and notices the time: I TRIED! I couldn't sleep in tho, I was really awake for some reason.  Somebody called me at three this morning and left a message. I tried answering it but got to it on the fourth ring because I thought it was a buzzer going off in a dream...when distinct rationality crept in and said "heya...that's your phone". Listening to the message this morning several things jumped out at me.  First, my message says something like "Hi, this is Josh at..."; the guy in the message refers to me as "Josh ua ". Most of it is very unintelligible. He refers to himself as "We" and says that "they" have to do something, altho it's blurred in redneck so I can't figure it out. He left me a number, my dad tried it from his cellphone at work but couldn't get thru because the recepient's phone was out of the Cricket area...which illustrates another good point, he uses Cricket, which really doesn't surprise me, I get wrong numbers from the BIGGEST rednecks in the world...I dunno where they're hiding these people, but there's times I just have to say "wrong number" and hang up because they're speaking American Japanese.   So...gonna try and call him from the house phone and ask him if he realizes that I'm not the most social person at three in the morning.  I'm scared. But that's ok because I get to go on a scavenger hunt with Abby and will thereafter cry, as usual. Heheh.
