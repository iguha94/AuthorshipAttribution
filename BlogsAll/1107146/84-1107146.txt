         You found Sarge! w00t! And I loved it, he's entirely true, he's just.......very colourful.   As for you, Rosie...I'm not exactly sure why you took to the post as you did but it really doesn't bother me. Fucking nobody is going to come out and say "hey, you're just a rainy-day friend" outloud, and no one is going to privately admit that to themselves, but there's a ton of detachment when summer comes around. When you fight in a war, you're best friends with some of those guys until the war's over, and then...what? My grandpa hasn't seen some of his Marine friends (I would dare say) since he was 30...he's 70 now. And they didn't go looking for each other.   Also, you have to understand that not all of my posts are important to just  one  person. I didn't write that so you could come on here and take it as a personal message, else your name would have been on it. I put these things here for self-reflection and if you all want to use it, be obliged, that's what it's here for.  But if you're going to have such limited sight as taking personal offense to something that wasn't even targeted at you, then what the fuck are you doing here in the first place? Nobody said I had to make everybody happy.  Life is fucking tough, you  adapt  or you  die .
