         Hahaha.  Remember when things weren't so complicated? That was fun.  There's fun in this, just weird fun. O well o well.  Je vais aller a la bibliotheque aujourd'hui, dans Nashville. Ce vais etre super, c'est la premier rendezvous avec la jeune fille qui a la nom Leigh Anne. Zut...je ne crois pas si je veux faire la rendezvous. J'ai peur. Mais, c'est la vie.  (I am going to go to the library today, in Nashville. This is going to be great, it's the first meeting with the little girl who is named Leigh Anne. Damn...I don't know if I am able to do it. I'm scared. But, that's life.)  Why did I do that, I dunno. I wanted to test mon technique de francais. I'm did for shit in that class last nine weeks.  And I get to meet Kenzie's friend that likes me, Laurie, heh she even asked me out last night, she's seen the "bird" picture, apparently, but she didn't know that was me when she did. So that's going to be fascinating.   But god, I couldn't believe it, how quick she was. "I need to get to know you better" and I knew it right then. And then later I flashed over to talk to Leigh Anne and I flashed back, and Kenzie was like, Laurie wants to know if you're available, and I was like, yah sure. I really hope she's not serious.  She's a redhead, I hear.  Godddddddd......  This could be a fucking  BAD  trip. Or good. But I don't know.   Do I ever?
