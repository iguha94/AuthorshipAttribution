         Posted by Rosie on the 31 of January: (*don't even ask why I'm doing this*)  "Have you realized how fake our society is. I mean think about it.....the whole world believes that everyone has there place and if they leave it......here comes the tidal waves. Crossing social barriers in BHS is next to impossible without whispers and stares. Is this what they call America, the most welcome country? Everyone plays to the role untill that role is all they have, so they stick to that role through life then pass it to there children. Ugg why can't people be themselves. Why can't people NOT fit the mold for once?"  "Slowly all the roles we act out become our identity, and in the end we are what we pretend to be" said Jerry once. It's like being a pack of animals, people will find a common ground and build on it, and that's how we get our social classes. Unless someone is truly  above  all of this shit, and it would be sort of nice to be that way, but it's unlikely. Social distinction, just another one of those shit consequences of having to be alive in the New Age.  And an Elizabethan reply (from Z, of course) for this post for anyone interested, on the 31: thereafter I posted all the lyrics to Poor Bastard, etc., more whining, then some more whining, DI, and on and on....oh yeah, the reply:  "Hey, Rosie, just a question. Why do you care? I for one am perfectly happy in my lack of social standing. I have thought of this subject before, however, and have decided that I don't care. And since when do I fit the mold? I'm one example. There have to be others. Linds, maybe."  .Dne eht
