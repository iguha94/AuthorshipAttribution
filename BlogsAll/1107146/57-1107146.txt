         Ok, so the shooting is over.  It turned out pretty good, I'd say. The battle scene was really fun, we had some AK death, execution-style, we had people trying to beat other people with sticks, we had Lightsabres, and it was really fun. And death, death,  death . Perhaps not the most realistic death ever, but death, nonetheless. This weekend we have to finish the mixdown and turn it all in. I hope we win, I heard the other ones really sucked this year. But the judges still got bribed really well, and I think they'll be fine, even if the movies really  do  suck.  Too cold! Filming was horrible! The cold kept making me forget my lines and want to quit, or get it over with as quickly as possible. And then I heard people talking about how the script sucked and the film was awful. Well maybe, fuckers, had you taken the damned time to help with the script instead of jacking off with the other morons outside making signs that were all torn down just yesterday, then the script and film could have aspects that you would like in it! Personally, they have absolutely NO right to complain, and it BURNS me to even think they could sit with such smugness in their infallibilities, never reasoning that the root of the problem could be in themselves.   I don't think everyone is stupid. O wait, I lied.
