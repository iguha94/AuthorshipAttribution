         Hmm, silent BLog.  Well considering there's been a new Stranglebox release, I guess I should post the lyrics, as I always do. This song is called  Broken Me    Broken Me  by Stranglebox  All wrong I know this ain't the right way Playing ping-pong Became the toy of my fate ss ss I wasn't thinking And all the sudden I'm down I'm like a fly trapped On a field full of glue My brain is ransacked All telling me what to do I'll never hear you Never ever again I'll make these words true As soon as I put down this pen  Hey hey, see me in between See this twisted dream It's just a seam Of what I might have been Hey hey, you're a broken lie To you it don't seem right To waste another day, it seems So loose the broken me who bleeds  So long I couldn't take anymore I guess I got strong And I walked right out the door You'll never hear me But you know I'll never care I had a vision Selfish, you blew it like air I'm just so tired I don't wanna do this again It's uninspired But I loved losing my head I'm going out there I'm falling into the trap Nothing left to share And it came to the point that I snapped  CHORUS  Something has touched me and I'll never be the same Something has touched me and I'll never be the same (bleed me out)  CHORUSx2  The end. It sounds so amazing, but I have to rerecord the whole thing because of a mistake, so it might be a while. Lots of rock-rap, kind of odd for me...but I sound ok. Uh, those ss's are where I forgot the words...heh, I was singing from the paper. And I screamed the whole second verse, in addition to rapping it...you guys  need  to hear this.
