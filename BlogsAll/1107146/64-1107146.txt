         Sweet guys, came back from the ER just now.  I got bitten by a spider. Woowoo. I was sleeping, then I woke up. I ate dinner, and my chewing became harder and harder to accomplish. I went to the bathroom mirror, and there was a huge white lump surrounded by a red circle. The outside bite got pretty bad but stopped. The inside one kept going til it got most of the gum below my teeth. We put ice on it and it stopped eventually, then we waited for someone to look at me in the ER for an hour. They said it was probably a spiderbite, and I shouldn't worry about it unless it starts getting big and purple, in which case it's time to go back for gangrene treatments induced by black widow/brown recluse bites. Then they gave me a tetinus shot...I've never looked at myself getting a shot before, so it was pretty cool...but those damned things are painful...whoa.   I stole a surgical glove, an ear inspector plastic disposable mahicker, and a tongue depressor, and in the lobby they had a basket of stickers, from which I took a Scooby Doo one; Scooby's awesome head is now betwixt my pickups, along with a sticker from one of my sister's magazines, which is orange, and simply says "Maybe?" If you all have any more stickers, I'd love to have them, I want to make my guitar look awesome.  The two ss's in  Broken Me  are "I never thought that / It all would come back around". Looking at the lyrics right now. I didn't have a session today for obvious reasons, but I did rerecord  Broken Me ...the new one sounds a lot louder and personally, horrible. But I'll do my best.   This 5th situation is spiraling out of control, just like I predicted, nobody can agree with anyone else, plus the fact that we're always getting off topic...I think that's a positive thing though, if you forget about things like these, they really do go away.  "That heathen devil weed, marijuana!"
