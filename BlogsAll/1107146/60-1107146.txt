         HEYA all. I'm in Spring Day, and the practices were yesterday...well, one of them.  You should hear me do the song  Freedom  by Rage Against the Machine; which is, of course, the only one I  am  doing, but that's besides the point. It's this Friday; I am so stoked.  But at the same time, I'm still trying to memorize the lines. Help me BLog, in my quest to memorize these stupid rap lyrics. This post will get bigger over the next few days   FREEDOM  by RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE  Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list All live, never on a floppy disk Inka inka, bottle of ink Pictures of rebellion Drawn up the thoughts I think  It's set up like a deck of cards They're giving us to early graves For all the diamonds They'll use a pair of clubs to beat the spades With poetry, I write the *forgot* And the murals that fit Don't turn away Get it front of it  Brotha, did ya forget ya name Did you lose it on the wall playin' tic-tac-toe  Yo, check the diagonal Three brothers gone, come on Doesn't that make it three in a row?  ANGER IS A GIFT  Brotha, did ya forget ya name Did you lose it on the wall playin' tic-tac-toe  Yo, check the diagonal Three million gone, come on Cuz you know they're counting backwards to zero  Environment The environment exceeding on the level Of our unconciousness For example What does the billboard say Come and play, come and play Forget about the movement  ANGER IS A GIFT  Freedom, yeah, freedom, yeah right Freedom, yeah, freedom, yeah   FREEDOM, YEAH, FREEDOM, YEAH RIGHT FREEDOM, YEAH, FREEDOM, YEAH RIGHT FREEDOM, YEAH, FREEDOM, YEAH RIGHT FREEDOM, YEAH, FREEDOM, YEAH RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHTTTTTTTTTT   Take Two  Solo, I'm a soloist on a solo list All live, never on a floppy disk Inka inka, bottle of ink Pictures of rebellion Drawn up by the thoughts I think  It's set up like a deck of cards They're sending us to early graves For all the diamonds They'll use a pair of clubs to beat the spades With poetry, I paint the pictures that hit For all the murals that fit Don't turn away Get in front of it  Brotha, did ya forget ya name Did you lose it on the wall playin' tic-tac-toe  Yo, check the diagonal Three brothers gone Come on Doesn't that make it three in a row?
