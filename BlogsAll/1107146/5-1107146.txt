         Jeezus, everyone's got mono these days.  Umm well, what's new...  The future that was full of potential is now full of uncertainty, for a lot of reasons. I'm worried that Kenzie is turning in to me, she sounds  just  like I have the past few weeks.  I had a thought, you may think someone's tortures are pathetic and stupid, but be a human and help them. That was very philanthropic, but it seems like everyone who has a pathetic problem is casted off as such, and were we to do this, we would be no better than animals...I think it's time to change the focus a little.  Happy Chinese New Year's Eve.  I just got finished burning POOR BASTARD VOLUME ONE (AUGUST 2002-JANUARY 2003). And it is GREAT and REALLY different from the first intended, this actually encompasses a much broader scope than the end of August, it strectches into the really bad part of the beginning of August, lots of weird stuff happening, parental conflicts, et cetera, mega depressed, which is why the stuff at the end of August started happening.   There's a lot I haven't talked about yet. Ask me sometime.  AND NOW, THE FINAL TRACKLIST, lyrics when I feel like it, there's 17 songs.
