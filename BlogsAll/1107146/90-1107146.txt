         Woot, ok.  Several new songs being recorded, but they've already been put down so it should be a lot quicker...no more, "just a few more days stuff". They'll be ready real soon. Some of the old songs ( My Solution  (the real version),  Little Rhyme  remixed a bit,  Hang My Head , which was never released but well practiced, that loveable old standby filler,  Goodbye My Friend ) and the newer ones that sound much different... Broken Me ,  So Low  (and for an opinion, Abby's heard it, so ask her),  Problems ,  On The Haywire ,  Painpainted ,  Close My Eyes , a new musical track that would probably sound good if you were doing hardcore hallucinogens, I don't have a name for it...I was planning on sort of putting it at the end of the last song as sort of an afterthought to the whole thing, somehow it's a really hardcore album for the most part and suddenly at the end of it all (and after  So Low 's plaintive guitar wailing at the end) there's this little random quiet guitar bit that goes for about two minutes and all is silent again, much like at the beginning of the album.  It's going to be awesome after I take psychology and start writing songs...they're going to mess with people's brains  worse than this thing will . I'm serious, just thinking about that whole "silence to silence" thing really messes with my head SO BAd. And I dun know why.  That's my cue to go to bed space cadets, not that I'm doing anything important, it's just that isolating myself for prolonged periods of time and then trying to socialize never works out very well.   Have fun kiddies.
