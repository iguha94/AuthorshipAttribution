         Awww, what Z is trying to say, but won't cause she hates mush, is that we'd miss you, Tao-Tao.  Life wouldn't be the same without you.  And Z, I won't be a legal adult when I go to college... I'll be seventeen, but you're right about the graduating early being a mess...too many horror stories out there for my taste.  And Josh, if you don't ask, one of these days when I'm really bored I will explain the herd.  As I said on my blog, I most likely won't be back at school or church next week.  Sorry yall.  Pass the word along to my other friends (and if you're feeling really generous, my teachers too.  Just the ones we both have.)  Hmmm.  I woke up about 4:45 this afternoon to find that nobody went to school today!!!  I was excited because that means that's one day less I have make up work for!!!  And Rosie, call me if things get too insane around your house.  Your calls entertain me.  And stick with interact...scholarship, remember?  And why take it all out on Will?  What did he do now?  Anyway, I'll see yall later.  I officially have my days and nights confused.  I'm what the zoos refer to as "nocturnal" currently.  But I am getting tired.  I'm going in for more blood work tomorrow to make sure they didn't screw up the diagnosis.  I hope they didn't.  Otherwise, that could mean a trip to the hospital for me to run tests to see what it really is.  Fun, fun.  So I'm going to go to bed now, I do believe.  See yall sometime this month, I hope, I hope. ~Linds
