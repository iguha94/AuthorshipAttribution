         Hi all.  Coach King said our skit was the "best, but the least technologically-endowed". That was kind of a bolster. We have a research paper in there, which was assigned our class on Friday; I've already finished it, mostly before I went to the DI meet...oh yeah, that.  I sucked. It was horrible. I died. We got second to last, we bombed the instant challenge, I sucked in the skit so there was really nothing to go on. I realize how much everyone was relying on me to shine in that thing, but I simply couldn't think fast enough. It was as if my brain was numb that day. After the fact I went and sat by myself for a while, I called my dad and talked to him for a while, I talked to my mom because I had before, telling her about how we blew it on the instant challenge, but just before I called her, as I was about to press the button to call her, in fact, I got a call from Rosie; it was a startling bolt of clarity in the midst of that depressive soup.  After the competetions were over, the team went across the street for pizza, and we explored a book shop next door, looking for a copy of  The Necronomicon  among other things, and swapping stories about the occult in the spellbook section of the place, located far in the back of the store. I came home and slept; what else was there to do? Moreover, what else did I want to do? I got into a few fights with my dad that day. It's starting to hurt me a lot, to have to fight with people. Lately, I've notice that I've been catching myself before I'm about to say something that'll set someone off. I can't believe I was so stupid as to think humanity was my toy. Sorry all.  It's weird, when I start fighting with someone these days; I just want to disappear, or cry, anything but start fighting. I can't understand it, it isn't like me at all.   Maybe it's just lack of sleep, maybe puberty giving way to maturity; whatever the case, it feel awful, and I hope I can stand up until it ends.
