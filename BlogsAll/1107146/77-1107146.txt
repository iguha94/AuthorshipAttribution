         Dudes, the weirdest thing happened...  I was at my grandma's today, and she goes..."I don't know if you'll have any use for this, but you can have it." She handed me a Best Buy gift card. I was drinking some milk at the time.  "So, how much is on it?" "Oh...fifty bucks, I think?" "Augh...ogg....ohh..eh....eh..." that was me choking my guts out, by the way...  So woot, fifty bucks for me, with which I bought CKY's  Infiltrate-Destroy-Rebuild , Linkin Park's  Hybrid Theory , Jerry Cantrell's  Degradation Trip, Volumes One and Two , and Metallica's  Master of Puppets , back when they were decent. So incredibly happy, I'll be sitting there smiling in front of my computer for days now, listening to such classics as  Sink Into The Underground ,  Owned ,  A Place For My Head , and the everlasting  Master of Puppets .   By the way...if youse goys happen to see a band called Sentenced at a CD store or something...and they have a CD called  Down  there...  I HOPE YOU HAVE A CELLPHONE BCUZ, AND NO MATTER WHAT TIME IT IS, AND NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, I DON'T CARE IF IT'S THE SOUTH POLE, I'LL PAY THE BILL IF YOU CALL ME ABOUT IT, BCUZ I NEED IT  NOW . Heheh, ok, so I've got all the songs on KaZaA, but I want it nonetheless.  Thank you for your concern, and have a good day. END TRANSMISSION
