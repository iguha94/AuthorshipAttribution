         Today was very bad.  Not for any descript reason...it was just one of those days where I woke up and said, "O shit, today's a really bad day," Not that there was anything bad about it...more like, I had convinced myself that something was wrong with today, and the whole world went down from there. It's like...I ran out of Cokes, I tried writing and couldn't, I wrote huge responses to posts...and then rethought them all together and wrote one line that doesn't really say anything. You know the way these days go. It was a "stranglebox" so to speak.  I'm so tired for some reason. Kind of sad when I realize that it's summer, and tiredness coupled with summer just cannot reasonably coexist.   There's No "I" In Team  by Taking Back Sunday  Well I can't regret it Can you just forget it I started something I couldn't finish If we go down, we go down together Best friends means What best friends means  And I've got a twenty dollar bill That says you're up late night starting Fist fights versus fences In you backyard Wearing your black eyes like A badge of honour Soaking in sympathy From friends who never loved you Nearly half as much as me  Broken down in bars and bathrooms All I did was what I had to You don't believe me when I tell you It's just what anyone would do Take the time to talk about it Think a lot and live without it Don't believe me when I tell you It's something unforgiveable  Well I can't regret it Can you just forget it I started something I couldn't finish If we go down, we go down together Best friends means What best friends means  You never knew Well I never told you Everything I know about breaking hearts I learned from you, it's true I've never done it with the style and grace you have But I've made long-term plans Based on these mistakes  Broken down in bars and bathrooms All I did was what I had to Don't believe me when I tell you It's just what anyone would do Take the time to talk about it Think a lot and live without it Don't believe me when I tell you It's something unforgiveable  Is this what you call tact? I swear you're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back So let's end this call And end this conversation There's nothing worse (That's right he said, that's right he said it) I swear you have no idea The jealousy that became me thinking That you always had it way too easy  Broken down in bars and bathrooms All I did was what I had to You don't believe me when I tell you It's just what anyone would do Take the time to talk about it Think a lot and live without it Don't believe me when I tell you It's something unforgivable  Best friends means I pulled the trigger,  Best friends means you get what you deserve...
