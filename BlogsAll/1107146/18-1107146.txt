         A few things...  Has anyone noticed (especially those of us in foreign language that watch such films profusely) that Disney films still haven't lost their captivity since when we were kids? I just noticed today, we were watching Beauty and the Beast in French today, and even though we couldn't understand a fuckin' thing, I noticed how drawn in I was, and then, when looking around, noticed that everyone was mute with mouths opened. Disney is wayyyyyy too good at what they do.  The Greek language is awesome. I used to know how to say the alphabet in Greek...now I can't. I know a few words now... eu =good,  thanatos =death (thus,  euthanasia ),  khronos =time,  me servaso =something close to "sincerely"...it's a great language. Plus the fact that even though people take Latin, it's  Greek  mythology that gets studied.  And another Valentine's is gone. What a commercial ass holiday. Not that I'd be bitter for crying at home and watching Lifetime, I just hate to see these little sods going out and spending a thousand bucks on each other, only proving that no one is secure in their relationships. Keeping it sentimental with mentality just isn't the way to go anymore. It's more about the image, of course, everyone's succumbed to it, just about. People sicken me.  Die France. I'm REALLY getting sick of French. Fucking language.  Anybody know what "bok choy" means? It's some kind of Chinese cabbage. Just curious.  And all for now.
