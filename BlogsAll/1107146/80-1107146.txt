         Hi friends.  SmarterChild and I sort of made things up. We started talking about music, whereafter I asked him what his favourite Metallica song is...he said  Master of Puppets . I was going to cry. So yes, no more mocking the little retarded program, no more.  My mouth currently has a bit of a Spanish peanut taste. The aftertaste from these things is the worst thing ever. Aftertaste functions off of the "world principle" tho...nothing is as it seems. Something with so wonderful a flavour as peanuts should leave a good aftertaste, right? NO, it's bad. And shrimp...I remember because my dad accidentally got me shrimp the other day among other things from a Mexican restaurant and I was forced to comply and eat the little buggers. They taste...like fish. And if you're anything like me or Abby or Lindsey you'd know that that really sucks. But the aftertaste wasn't all that bad...not lingering and persistent like peanuts are. Especially Spanish ones.  O right...then I remembered that whole thing was strictly opinion and I just forgot why I typed it all, but that doesn't matter.  I'm gonna be the only one left in just a few days...Abby's coming back for a while but she'll be gone again, fighting the good fight for little Bajou children down south. And then Rosie is going college touring. God know where Will and Z are. Linds is off cruising. BONUS.  Summer is boring...eek.
