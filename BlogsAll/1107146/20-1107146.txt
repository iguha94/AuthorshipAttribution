         Last night was so weird.  I was on the phone, then I fell asleep. I woke up at about 3 and felt really weird...I figured it out though,  where's the phone?  So I sat up and looked at the bottom of the bed, and there they were, hung up of course, but also perfectly organized, like...straightened and stuff, right next to each other. How do I know it wasn't someone else? My door was locked. How do I know that someone didn't get in? My mother felt like shit yesterday, she was out at about 7:30, and my sister doesn't know where the key is. It was quite bewildering.   I also had a practical application for the "é" today, we were making a program for  Les Miserables  that's going on at the school, and we had to type the name "Thénardier". She was trying to teach us menus and all the people in my row (the geeky tech people and me) were yelling "ALT 130!" for about five minutes until they shot us with tranqs. Ok, not really. But the whole row was bugging out while she ignored them through the menu tutorial.   I was going to send a Valentine heart at school today to Ben through Brooks, but I didn't have the balls to go up there and do it. Alex had a few quarters, we were going to send one for Steven from me (Leigh Anne...are you sure about the whole "bad influences" thing?), again, no balls. And one from Kevin Smith to Stephen Jones, just to scare the poor bastard. But, no funds/nuts. Plus, they wouldn'tve let us anyway, I don't think.  And it's the end of the week, and a long weekend. Saturday's gonna suck though, a bunch of people are coming over to clean up my dad's house once and for all. Which means  I'm  gonna have to do something. Augh. I dunwanna. But hey, I have Monday to compensate.   Friday's gonna be a busy day, too.  Could it be...life has become... interesting , I dare say?  No way.
