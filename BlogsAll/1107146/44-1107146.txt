         I found, quite possibly, one of the best songs I've heard in a long time this weekend.  Of course, with my much overexaggerated announcement do you all know I got the album  A Dead Poem  this weekend, and with it came a sampler CD of the best black metal acts in Europe, one of which came from...right...one of those Baltic states, and one of the acts is called Sentenced, the song,  Shadegrown . It sounds just like the better parts of Metallica, Black Album-era, and even though I can't understand what he's saying, and no, it's not like Rotting Christ garbled, it's  just  like Metallica, and I mean down to the vocals, the lyrics are simply catchy. It's enough by this one song to make me by the album. And believe me, considering how much I like Rotting Christ, I was  ultimately  unimpressed by the first song of theirs I heard,  A Dead Poem .  As for other news, I'm getting the AudioBLogger in a few days. Here's the plan: those posts are going to be geared toward certain topics, and they're only going to be on the weekend, thrice a weekend, since those are the times I have no Internet, and they all have titles for the next three months, such as the first one,  Hello/The Names , which is the introduction to the audbloggings and discussing some of the names in here, and yes, I already have all of these written out. The whole catch is, only two minutes to each post. Which means I have to be  quick  in divulging the secrets of life, or harder, my life in general. The second posts is  The Dreams , talking about having a thousand dreams lately, about the most random things.  That shall be about soon.  Until then, keep it bitter, so to speak.
