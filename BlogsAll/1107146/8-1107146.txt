         Well here's the last post on badvision...  Lily was editing it at the library, Leigh Anne looked over her shoulder, boom. That was the end of it.  So let me say something.  Friends understand each other, they understand why others do things, and they are quick to forgive. Friends want friends around, and if they really don't, then they really don't want to be friends at all. Something, but not friends.  And friends listen to others. Perhaps the answers we're all looking for lie in the ones were ignoring, probably because they're right. I know this, I have found this several times.  I know who my friends are.  I know what I don't understand.  I know that if this understanding is to come, it's on the part of the thing not understood.  I have seen my mistakes.  I've tried to fix them.  I cannot.  Because they never die.  The funny thing about any problem I have is, none of them are bad at all anymore. The thing is, they're just so well timed. Things are good for me and suddenly it's a one-two punch and it all falls down again, I think it's not going to be that way for much longer, I see myself looking at these things as no surprise, and with no more surprises, they'll just stop happening.  I revamped the song  Bitter  for the third time see what you can get out of the first lines: "Where did my sunshine go, I think it's ever-fade"...if that tells you anything.  Play with fire and you get burned, though, that's the way the cookie crumbles, the ball drops, the bee stings, one two three whee. I should've seen this coming, if it's public access it's bound to end up that way.  But I hope you all know why I made the posts I did, I hope you all know why I do these things, and I think you do.  Because if not, just leave off of me.  And again I turn the page.
