as far as all the potential slayers becoming slayers  at the same time, i don't think that was heavy-handed or took away from the message of personal empowerment. one of the purposes for buffy in the first place was to create a powerful female character who was also human and had human foibles and desires.  buffy was not so much someone beyond us as she was someone who despite all of her powers and responsibilites was so much like us. and, i believe, one of the messages of the series was that we (women), in one way or another,  are all potential slayers - we all have untapped powers that we just need to realize and cultivate.  and as faith herself as shown, just because you are female does not mean you will be "good" if given the power of a slayer.  faith did turn back to the good side but not before a long, difficult struggle.   now it can be argued that there was no real male empowerment going on - i personally think men have more than enough rolemodels for that already.  and the men in buffy were strong - even spike who sacrificed himself for the love of a woman who he knew would never truly love him back.  such an archetypal theme -- the pain that is borne from unrequited love.   and i agree that the angel part was nice but contrived.  however, the line about her "cookieness" was worth it.
