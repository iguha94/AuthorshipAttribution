Castillion was rescued during the collapse by unnamed friends, and is now alive and well in the Ethereal.  The party talked with him in the office of Din Dal Kut, who resides on a splinter plane.  It seems that when Thulos took Terranel, the "local group" of the multiverse was torn away with it, and all exist as a miniature multiverse in the in-between-place.  A side result of this occurence is that, according to Castillion, the dead have nowhere to go, and have been gathering at an unknown city for millenia.  Castillion is now dedicated to renewing contact with the gods, if possible.  He has recommened that the party join forces with the Harpers, a secret society formed by the last Elven bard at the very end of the Great Retreat.  Upon seeing Calleum and the banner of Heironeous in a magical viewing painting/frame on Din Dal Kut's office wall, Burne leapt to join his mentor, and was last seen in a battle in Rashemen, one of the lands that borders the Far East.  The act broke the portal, and the party was unable to follow.  Also, Castillon is Ian's father.  Having reached the end of the original journey, Ian and Gregory are beginning to question if they should continue, or return to Tilverton to tell of Castillion's demise -- which was Castillion's request, as the truth would be too difficult to understand.  Players have the option of sending their character off to do something long-term, and create and play a new character.  The world stage has expanded wide enough to accomodate such.  Once the false murder rap is resolved, the party may see the Breaking of the original Fellowship -- but the beginning of a much larger, world-spanning epic.
