more lyrics for members of the circle of irony: Just Like Anyone  So maybe I wasn't that good a friend but you were one of us and I will wonder just like anyone if there was something else I could've done So maybe it's true that your cry for help was oh, so very faint but still I heard and knew something was wrong just nothing you could put your finger on and I will wonder just like anyone just like anyone     Susan  Oh, Susan, you were clued in you knew just how this thing would go a prognosis that was hopeless from the very first domino I guess I see it all in hindsight I tried to keep perspective despite the flash of the fuse, the smell of cordite Now I'm in that place again and I know he can't come in to get me and someday he will live to regret me Susan, I can see it now Oh, Suzy - they get to me they can really be wearying but he threw me rope and buoy let me use his decoder ring there must have been some kind of parade we kissed for a while to see how it played and pulled the pin on another grenade Now I'm in that place again and I know he can't come in to get me and someday he will live to regret me Susan, I can see it now Oh, Susan, the hope of fusion is that the halo will reappear it may be pure illusion but it's beautiful while it's here I had some trouble with the  goodbye I checked my Roman candle supply and watched the vapor trail in the sky But I'm in that place again and I know he can't come in to get me and someday he will live to regret me Susan, I can see it now
