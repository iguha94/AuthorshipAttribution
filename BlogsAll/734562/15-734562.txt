Mir - I have no idea how old you are, but I think we are all seeing the effects of disatisfaction with our current lots in life.  I don't know if it falls under the category of "mid-life crisis", but it seems to be similar.  To all those listed below, these are just my observations and are in no way intended to be judgemental.  Me - Established in my career (11 years now); Secure in my position and qualifications within my company; Am tired of doing what I am doing and looking for a possible change into computer programming Mir - Not happy with her current lot in life and seeking a change, though aparently unsure of what the change should be. Johnnathan - Working to get by and meet his next goal of an advanced degree in literature; no desire to stay in his current career Scott - Looking at a change to Real Estate; burned out on IT Jimi - Going to school after his immediate post high school education plans fell through Ben - After years of seemingly aimless work, entered the "mainstream" workforce  So, of us 6 in RTG (with the exception of Neal, whom I have not known long enough to observe such details), 5 of us are actively or at least considering career changes.  I think that maybe we have been seduced by the American dream where anybody can be sucessful if they find something they truely love.  I could stay where I am now and provide for my familys needs for the next 30 years,  But, will I be happy?  Probably not.  Is this a local phenomenon or a cultural event?  It is strange that people less than 10 years into a career could be so burned out.
