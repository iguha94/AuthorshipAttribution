Regardless of one's opinion regarding Iraq, it is undeniable that should individuals or groups decide to retaliate, it will be us -- you, me, our families, our friends -- who will be the favored target.  We -- the citizens of this country -- are about to be enlisted in a cause for which we may die.  Not the soldiers, not the pilots, not the marines -- us.  The question is not are you willing to sacrifice the professional soldiers for this cause -- but are you willing to sacrifice yourself, on the battlefield of the shopping mall or apartment building?  Are you willing to trade the life of your three-year-old so that peace will prevail?  Because the Apache helicopter is awfully hard to hit.  But a playground, now -- right down the road from you -- that's easy pickings.  I suspect a great many people have not made the logical connection from the desert waaaaay over there to their own office building.  Sure, we watched the WTC fall; we watched the people jumping from windows.  But it is human nature to believe oneself immortal; to believe it's all a video game.  Which it is, until the stage catches fire and the night club is filling with smoke and you're reminded that Hey, dude, this is, like, real.  This posting is not for or against the war -- just a reminder that a vote for it is a tacit acceptance of the possibility that the cost of the goal will not be professional soldiers, but your niece, burned or gassed or diseased or shot.  Granted, one may feel that is going to happen anyway, so what the hell.  And a valid argument can be made for that.  I just hope our eyes are open.  Wide.
