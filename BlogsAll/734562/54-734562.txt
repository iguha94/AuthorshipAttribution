And let's run with the World Dance Party scenario:  Yes, we're at a party, and yes, we're playing some pretty rockin' dance music (the remix of Oingo Boingo's "Dead Man's Party" sounds pretty good to me right now...), and yes, we'd love for everyone to dance. But, no, we're not turning up the music louder. We're only encouraging everyone to have a good time, like any good host, whether they are dancing or not. And the problem is not that there are people who don't want to dance. It's that the kitchen is full of band geeks, D&D freaks, and goth-wannabes who hyperventilate when girls talk to then and wouldn't know how to dance if John Travolta delivered private lessons. And there's a trumpet player who is stirring up trouble with this anti-social crowd because he doesn't like Oingo Boingo, and our intrepid band of misfits is starting to get surly. So -- do you let the party dissolve into a brawl? No -- you do your damnedest to get everyone involved in the party -- because when people are having fun, they aren't plotting to blow up governement buildings. And you take the trumpet player out into the back yard, beat the snot out of him, and ask him to leave the party. Which only makes him more disaffected, but as there aren't but a few sycophant baritone players and a doe-eyed clarinet chick left for him to whip up, it's OK to let them go sulk at the I-Hop down the street.  That's my take.
