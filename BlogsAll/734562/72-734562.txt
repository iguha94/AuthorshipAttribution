I've been thinking about this...how, exactly, is it our fault if Iraqis loot their own historical artifacts?  They're not our children.  It seems to me that if they don't see a difference between stealing a Sony television from a Baath vacation home and stealing jewelery or pottery of their own heritage and history from 4,000 years ago, then that's really their problem, and they should receive the brunt of the outrage.  The fact that looting was possible -- that is our fault, to some degree, for not planning for a more rapid law enforcement plan (assuming one was even possible).  But *what* they loot -- that seems to me to be merely a reflection of either their own wisdom or ignorance.  I share this thought (which may be changed without notice) because the whole affair has sparked in me an interesting question:  Are the historical treasures of a culture the property and responsibility of that culture, or the world at large?  I'm not talking about interest -- of course they're of great *interest* to the world.  But does that interest translate seamlessly into the realm of property and responsbility?  I'm reminded of the Taliban blasting those awesome Buddhist sculptures.  Would there have been justification for external cultures to use force to protect those works on behalf of the world community?  If not, then why all the anger directed at the world community for not stopping Iraqis from looting their own heritage?  Granted, one can argue that the world community created a situation in which looting could flourish -- but does this argument truly address the issue?  At some point, shouldn't a culture or a people show some restraint and control their more childish, primitive passions?  If they are unable to do so -- is that truly our fault?
