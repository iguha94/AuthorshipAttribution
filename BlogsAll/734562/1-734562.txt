  						   In an earlier post, Johnathan said:   "And then: What of Gregory? Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone, or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun, patrolling the darkness that lurks therein? ........ There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits. But what Glory will that be? The Local Hero? The Regional Hero? The Hero of the Land? The Hero of a World? Or the Hero of the Multiverse?"   To respond to this in a way, I would say that Gregory is really having to make a sort of leap of faith to swallow all of this extraplanar stuff.  He gets it and doesn't get it at the same time.  He can understand the world as being a large and changing place, but seeing Father Castillion in the Ethereal plane...well, freaked him out.  To Gregory, it was basically like talking to a ghost, and that is just creepy.  He understands gods, but for there to be something bigger than gods that can take a whole planet and put it in the middle of a nothingness place, it's just a bit much.  Even though he is actually experiencing it, he is still kind of thinking in the back of his mind, "Yeah....right....whatever you say man."  And what glory will he find?  Local Hero?  Multiverse?  He would most likely never expect to rise above something between Hero of the Land and Hero of the World.  Frankly, because he doesn't really see/understand the whole multiverse thing, and even being "Hero of the World" is kind of pretentious in his eyes.
