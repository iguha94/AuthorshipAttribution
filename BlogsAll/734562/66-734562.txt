Oh, I wouldn't consider myself all that high fashion or in-crowd either...I just know names and products, but I can't afford any of it.  Loreal is a makeup company, but it's a parent company to other professional salon hair and make-up products as well...Laurent is a fashion designer, who might specialize in leather goods, and Gotier is actually spelled Gautier or something...he's also a designer.  Does a lot of stuff for Madonna, I think.  Anywho, leather goods, hair & makeup (and fragrance) AND clothes are all parts of "fashion," which is why I lumped them all together.  For example, Calvin Klein also has a line of cosmetics and cologne, as well as shoes, underwear, clothing, etc.  Croissants are extremely bad for you.  But they're oh-so tasty.  I hold that the reason why European nations like France and Italy aren't obese despite all of the foods they eat is this:  lifestyle.  They relax.  Work is not what defines them like it is in the U.S.  They take their time in preparing their food, eating their food, living their lives.  They have siesta.  They are not so focused on making money and working hard as they are living and enjoying life and each other.  And I think that lowered stress level really does a lot in terms of how they look.  I think we as Americans are always go go go...eating instant foods, full of preservatives, shoving them in our gullets as quickly as possible so we can go go go some more.  We're all fat because we don't digest.  And we don't sleep and rest as we should, so our bodies don't metabolize the same way.  Our work ethic is very different from theirs.    And this is not to say that one way is better than the other.  We make LOTS more money here because of our Protestant work ethic.  It's part of what makes us a capitalist nation.  But it's also a big part of why we're a fat nation, too...
