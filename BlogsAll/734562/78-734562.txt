Two cents:  wrong and evil, and for that matter right and good, are not the same thing.  Also:  of the final examples, I feel rape is the stronger of the two.  Murder is a sub-category of ending a life, and requires more clarification to be both relevant and effective.  A minor distinction, but an important one for your larger argument.  As to the issue of suffering needlessly, I am generally curious:  at what point does the suffering become needless?  For that matter, when is suffering needful?  Is suffering validated by the beauty or wisdom that comes from it?  If one person suffers from a disease and draws on that suffering to compose a heartrending symphony and then dies, while another without such talent stares out a dirty window until he or she suffers the same fate, unknown and unheard -- were both experiences equally needless?  What of the many who will be touched by and grow from hearing the symphony?  For that matter, what of the son or daughter of the other individual, who, having watched the loved one die, dedicates him- or herself to raising a stronger and more loved family than might have been possible before?  Does that person's suffering suddenly become needful?  I raise such questions not because I favor generally institutionalized suffering -- surely not -- but I am reluctant to dispense with suffering altogether by labeling it as needless, without understanding where the line is drawn, beyond the usual extreme examples.  I feel that only by defining one's terms can one be assured of success in any discourse.  Once again, my issue is with absolutes.  I am wary of them.  They occur nowhere in the universe except the human imagination, and I have yet personally to see one single absolute that applies in infinite cases at infinite times.
