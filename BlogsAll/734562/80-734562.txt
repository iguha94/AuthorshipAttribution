r/R, d/D:  The subject is a bit cumbersome for blog posting.  But I will try, by presenting a series of possibly unfair oversimplifications.  As a republican, I focus on the realistic application of the political philosophy, while ignoring all specific issues.  (R)epublicans (and (D)emocrats) usually unite political philosophy and social engineering.  As I use the terms, to be (r)epublican or (d)emocrat is to place a template, a patterned design, atop an ever-moving and ever-changing society.  (r)s and (d)s don't particularly mind what that constantly-moving society believes or wants or fears, as long the overlaying template is there to best realize its desires.  The overlaying template or design exists not as a restriction, but as the best possible expediter of the society's desires.  For example, I believe ideas best flow up, from local to national.  To enforce this empowers, challenges, educates, and generally lights a fire in the populace.  I don't particularly care what the ideas are, as long as they push upward from the grass.  This is exciting and involving.  A democrat might believe that ideas best flow down, from national to local.  Such a path has the valid benefit of increased speed and less effort.  But for various reasons, I generally reject it despite its strengths.  In general, I perceive (R)epublicans and (D)emocrats as starting from this point, but then grafting onto this foundation a superfluous catalog of issues, agendas, and ideologies.  Also, (R)s and (D)s usually strike me as absolutist, which is not to my taste.  I am not entirely pleased with the words I've chosen or the presentation of my ideas, but I felt it only fair to respond to your inquiry.  Most of these ideas and opinions are only recently formed, and are not ready for prime time, so to speak.  But here is a flawed attempt at communicating them, just the same.
