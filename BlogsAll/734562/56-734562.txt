Clarification:  I do not define appeasement by addressing an attacker's complaints while simultaneously exacting wholesale and decisive retaliation for that individual's attack, which is the argument I am making.  If, however, there is no way at all to address the attacker's concerns, I argue that there is no option but to wipe out the entire ideology.  Because the ideological warrior cannot be deterred, ever, as long as he or she exists.  I hesitate to use the word "ideology," because a counter-argument could be made re: Communism, which one could argue was a deterred ideology -- but I feel any attempt to compare radical Muslim fundamentalism to Communism is foolish, so I'll let it stand.  Waiting out a political, economic, and social movement is far different from waiting out an opponent who is following the words of the one and only Creator of all that exists.  It sounds as if those who support reacting to the deed without addressing the reason, do so because there is, in fact, no way to address the reason.  Since I would rather not see a future in which We and They are locked in violent conflict until the end of our species, it seems to me that within these restrictions, we must wipe out all violent Muslims, everywhere, and strike them from the historical record.  Given these restrictions, that seems to be the only remaining option for a lasting peace for this and future generations.  Please, someone convince me that there is hope to be found in reacting to the deed and not the reason.  The argument and consequences as I understand them reveal to my eyes a future of unending violence, bloodshed, and death upon death upon death.
