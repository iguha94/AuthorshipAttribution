the latest, for all who care:  my car was declared a total loss by the INS company, so i get a payoff to use against the $ i owe on the loan i originally took out to buy it.  it will cover it and then some, but that "sum" is pretty low.  i expect i will buy another Insight, as it's still the best car on the market as far as i'm concerned, so expect to see "moondog 2.0" within the next 30 days or so.  i have a lawyer now, and he is taking my case forward.  i should only say so much about all that, but i'll speak up as events warrant.  my recovery is slow but sure, and i still do not know when i'll return to work, or to normal life; i still can't sit for anymore than 15-30 minutes without needing to eventually lie down, but the pain i'm having has decreased somewhat.  which is a real drag, considering how badly i want to see certain movies that are out right now, but they will have to wait.  once again, i thank everyone in the circle for their kindness and patience since last wednesday.  apparently, you find out who your friends are when you have a health emergency as well as when you move!  you've all been very supportive and i will not forget.  feel free to email me at home whenever you like; calls are OK too, but it's generally easier for me to concentrate on the written rather than the spoken, per my fatigue and pain.  plus, since i'm sleeping at odd times, you may inadvertently awaken me in the daylight hours; typically i turn my ringer off when i go to sleep, but these days i need to leave it on during the day to get calls from my doctor(s), lawyer and INS folk which tend to be timely and must be taken ASAP.  well, enough of me.  somebody talk about politics or something.
