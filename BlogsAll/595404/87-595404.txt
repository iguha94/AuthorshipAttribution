         ok, so i think i have a cold, and i am already starting to worry that i will feel miserable on the plane and in barcelona.....however, i still have today and tomorrow to stock up on  nyquil and tissues.....so many things i want to get done before we go...clean out the freezer, take old clothing to the goodwill,  get tax stuff together, put photos in albums (i am 2 years behind, maybe 3) i will be happy if i get any of it done.  acw has also asked that i put together another list of songs for a second burned cd mix- here it is so far-  carole king tapestry & you got a friend,  joni mitchell california and free man in paris, led zep kashmir and stairway to heaven, bob dylan forever young and like a rolling stone, david bowie changes, csn&y suite judy blue eyes & southern cross, dan fogelburg since you've asked & part of the plan, karla bonoff home, allison krouse when you say nothing at all.....not a one less than 5 years old- mostly 25+ but, then we don't get cable so i don't watch mtv or vh1, etc. and i only really listen to npr news and/or world cafe sometimes on the way home from catering a late party....ecw's siblings were all in amazement that we don't get cable- confounded that someone related to them could have little interest in watching enough television to make the price worthwhile...yes- i would like to see many things that a&e produce, but my mom tapes them for me......in our cable-free world, we have many evenings without the tv on at all and family members are forced to do something else, like read.....or blog.......
