         ok, so i listened to the most thought provoking 45 minutes of radio on my way back from lex this evening- studio 360 on wuky. the first guest was annie drehan(sp) the wife of the late carl sagan who has an entertainment company that specializes in space. she worked on a music project 20 years ago when voyageur went up- she put together a recording to 27 pieces that best defined the world music scene- along with images of man and woman that were physically neutral rather than 'correct'. congress at the time told her that if she included full frontal it would not be sent- 'congress will not fund the sending of smut into space........' 20 years later, an artist named joe davis, who has gotten himself hooked up with MIT is working on a project to correct the omissions- called poetica vagina. he has digitally recorded vaginal contractions, and linked them to the 45 or so sounds in the english language, and is transmitting these vaginal poems into space..........he is also working on an e-coli transmission project. each space flight discards solid waste, containing e-coli,  into the great void, and aliens may encounter mankind by its refuse. joe davis is simply transmitting the e-coli genetic code into space in case aliens are out there searching for us through our intestinal bacteria.........this guy is either quite brilliant or quite mad.....  on the other hand, i offered my youngest child a piece of this delicious watermelon as a treat before bed- sent her out the deck with a wedge and told her to throw the rind into the compost pile when she was done- she came right back in, confused as to how one eats watermelon without a spoon.......somehow life's simple pleasures are lost on those whop lack the instinct to put the face directly to the food.......  lastly, speaking of red hair, i have a box of auburn rinse that i almost put in my hair before i went to europe last winter.  maybe next time.........i can see myself as an upity redhead.......
