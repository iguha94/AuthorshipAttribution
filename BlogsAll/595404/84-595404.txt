         ok, so i waited inline for nearly an hour to get tickets to see harry potter chamber of secrets.  the wait in line was almost as good as the movie- one meets a random crowd while waiting- and this wait was worth mentioning.  for starts, the couple with a 6 year old in front of me all wore danville admiral clothing- though they live in houstonville and the child does not go to danville schools. the mother in this grouping used to work at joseph-beth, and quit because they only paid a max of $10 and hour and only gave 10% discount on books.  she had to pass a test to qualify to work there, which is encouraging in terms ofjust who tells us where to find certain books....... she knows an author in georgia who writes cozy mysteries involving show dogs..........the woman just in back, with 2 children about 7 or so saw 8-mile while her children saw harry potter- but the harry potter film broke during the 10:00 showing and they came and watched the end of 8-mile with her..........which did not seem to bother her that her young ones saw anything of eminem's movie.  she was only bothered to have to come back today for them to see the rest of harry potter.  i let an aquaintance cut inline with me, when she announced that she was wanting tickets to santa clause 2- her children go the the christian school and she could not be seen taking them to harry potter..... satan connections, you know-- she actually said this-----though she did admit to reading the first book secretly!!!!!!!!!and to having seen the first harry potter on video- she admitted that it didn't seem too satanic to her, but the school was quite clear about its stance on the books and films........that kind of bologna gives christianity a bad name........curiously, everyone in this little enclave had seen aerosmith in concert except me.........don't even ask me how this came up.....it was a long wait........oh, yea- the second movie was scarier than the first edition......now i can't wait to see the second edition of the lord of the rings.......i wonder how long i will wait for those tickets..........
