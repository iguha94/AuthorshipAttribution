         ok, so i found a white hair amongst my otherwise brown hairs on my head this morning- and i am freaked out.  this hair was white- not even grey- and while i only saw the one there may be others lurking nearby.....i should feel fortunate to be 46 and to have had so few encounters with fading coloration (i found a grey hair a few years ago- but it must have been a mutant because that seemed to be the end of it, or so i thought....) i do not want to have to color my hair- i so dislike the thought of having that telltale skunk stripe down the middle of my head when the hair starts to grow out and the grey/white roots show...  i am still bummed out about a child i encountered as part of one of my freelance nutrition consulting ventures.  this child is 9 years old and has lost 15 pounds in the past 2 months.  he told me without blinking that he doesn't eat because he wants to die- the grave is the only place for him since his mother doesn't want him, nobody wants him.  it is sad to think that in this land of plenty there are children who have so little- so little love and attention, so little cause for joy.  that's a picture that i can't get out of my mind. ..it puts my fretting over a white hair in perspective.
