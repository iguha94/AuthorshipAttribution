         ok, so mean mamma is very slow at the uptake when it comes to humor. yesterday stephan and i launched into our fourth remake of our fishpond.  we dismantled everything, down through all 3 liners, including the original one that i installed after going to the chelsea flower show and deciding that i could not live without a water feature in my yard.  the liner i bought was small, which basically dictated that size and shape of my pond.  the liner that we bought yesterday was 12 x 12- stephan and i continue to enlarge the pond based on the generous size of said liner- we have acheived roundness and may reach oval status as we dig closer to the fence line.  stephan also had the bright idea to move the waterfall around to the side so it can be seen from the deck- did i tell you that my son is brilliant? anyway, back to the humor.  when ernst got home from work, stephan's first words to him were "do you want to bring out the level?' it is so funny now- the next morning- in that when stephan and i launched into our brickwalk around the flowerbeds project- ernst kept trying to get us to use the level to make sure that the walks would be even.  we soon abandoned use of said level, because we were building on a hill anyway, and very few sections could be level anyway.  i don't think ernst caught on that stephan was actually making a joke out of the level- i certainly didn't catch on.........anyway- the fourth version of the lily pond is going to be tremendous......i certainly hope that we will not require version number 5...........
