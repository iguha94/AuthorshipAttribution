         ok, so mean  mamma is quite upset over an unsettling incident that just happened- at 8:00 am in my own place of business.......  of(old friend?)- 'c-w- i just know you are mad at me and i want to know why' - says 'of' as she bustles into the staff door of the restaurant as i am taking off my coat......  kcw- i didn't know i was mad at you- what makes you think that?  of- i think it is because of the incident at church- i have thought a lot about this and i am certain that it comes down to that.  kcw- i recall that incident only vaguely(regarding our daughters sneaking out of choir)- but really- how can i be mad if i don't really remember....  of- i just know that you must be mad because i don't see you anymore....  kcw-  you don't see me anymore because i spend all of my time working- i am either here or in the bed......i am sorry if i gave you any other impression.....  of- as she leaves-  well- i just wanted you to know that i punished  my daughter for that incident, and i just know that you are still mad about it..... (of drives away in her late-model suv) and mean mamma bursts into tears because it occurs to her that 'of' has become 'unstable', and because my work has made friendships hard to keep up with.  still, this incident is quite bizarre.  i cannot remember a similar one unless i think back to my sophomore year- when susan weller said pretty much the same thing to me with different particulars..........maybe i need a good sign of the curse to ward off the evil.........
