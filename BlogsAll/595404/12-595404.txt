         ok, so i looked all day for an excuse to use the term 'in high dudgeon', it is so jane austenesque. frankly, i have been in high dudgeon all day- for no particular reason other than i would rather be at home, with a good book, and a glass of wine, out on my deck, getting just a bit of sun. the sun thing is less important now that i have discovered that estee lauder sells perfectly respectable sun in a squeeze bottle.  i do not have a new good book just now-but i am rereading some old good books that a friend returned to me recently( i apologize to those in my family who were falsely accused of having said books....) i have reread the pleasing hour, by lily king, le marriage and le divorce , 2 books by diane johnson, and will reread the hours (?author) next.  the hours is being filmed with tom cruise's ex wife whose name escapes me as the star.  it is based on virginia wolfe's life and either the wave or to the lighthouse or both- but is in no way autobiographical-i read the book based on a review heard on npr (ditto for the pleasing hour) i have only made a few mistakes with reading books reviewed on npr, by the way.  adults should be issued summer reading lists just to keep them up to snuff on what is out there worth reading.......no tests, please.
