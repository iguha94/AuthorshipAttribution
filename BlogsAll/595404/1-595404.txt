         a student in my class tonight commented on food additives as a reason for the early development of girls in america. she claimed that her pediatrician had told her that her own daughter (age 10) probably developed early because of all the processed food she ate.  I really cannot believe that preservatibves would have anything to do with early estrogen production, but i didn't tell her so.  i have not yet mentioned the eku class that i teach 2 semesters a year- nutrition 201, required for nursing students. the best students are the mature ones- in their late 20's to late 50's, who have already worked awhile- married, had children, and have gone back to school to do something they want to do.  they study harder, make better grades,and contribute much more colorfully to class discussion.  college, it could be saie, it wasted on those who have just finished high school.  the young ones tend to sit in the back and chat amongst themselves rather than pay attention.....i wished that i had paid more attention to selected college classes- like art history. i had been to many art museums at the time, but lacked the curiosity to study paintings closely for composition, focal point, etc. when i was actually in front of famous paintings.  in brussels i particularly enjoyed rachel's discussion on alterpieces, the reason for the two sides, the meaning of the fantastic creatures amongst the religious elements. etc.   how enviable to grow up with an artist.....
