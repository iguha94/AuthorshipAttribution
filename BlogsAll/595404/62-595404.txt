         ernst's sister lisa came for a brief visit with her middle child and a friend- they came to danville by way of the extreme sports park in louisville where they spent the morning on skateboards.  alex and his friend are 14- he is going to be a freshman in a catholic school in cincinnati- we had avery nice supper out on the deck, and caught up on all of the estate-settling gossip- lisa is the executrix of her mother's estate- which could be resolved in the next month or two.  i will believe it when i see it.  we had a nice chat about how we miss her mother (my motherinlaw), but did both share in some memories of awful, thoughtless things she said to us and about us.  i guess all families have these sort of memories- which are basically unresolved issues now that we cannot tell the person how much these comments hurt.  one of my favorite lines from my motherinlaw was the time she was looking at vacation pictures of ours, with pictures of each of us, and groups of us c-w's and stated 'kathy, you don't photograph well, do you'  there is not much one can say after your motherinlaw says something like that to you- of course, she could have said something nice to soften that blow- like kathy you always look better in person than you do in photos- but no- she left it with the insult.  ah well, unresolved issues.....maybe that is why i am so mean today...........
