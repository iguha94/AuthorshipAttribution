         ok, so this morning on the way to work, the morning business report, with chi risdoll (sp) began with the words- ok, so......i started laughing out loud- it was like listening to myself for a moment...  so stephan has commited to a trip to spain- so now we have to decide which of the many scenarios we will choose.  last night ernst and i sat down to discuss the many travel opportunities that stephan has for the coming year- including a rotary exchange that will take up 6 weeks of this summer (3 weeks in belgium + 3 weeks with the belgium child at our house), the italy trip, the spain trip, margo goodwin's france trip next year, and ernst's bike trip across wyoming, idaho and oregon (2 weeks or so)  ernst was somewhat taken aback that scw would consider going to italy with ms. bennett given her lack of knowledge and preparedness in her current class- it doesn't give one much confidence on a foreign adventure- that and stephan's closer friends have either not commited to that trip or are passing altogether.  regardless, i cannot wait to see the delights of spain.  wasn't there a three dog night song that started out...i ain't never been to spain, but i have been to oklahoma......  speaking of wonderful places - i also have a fondness for boulder, colorado. my parents have college friends who live on hamilton court (in an older section of town) we visited regularly when i was growing up, and stephan stayed with them once when i went to a workshop in denver- they took him up to estes park(?) on a day trip into rmnp. i think it is just an idyllic place, with lots of things to do, places to eat- lots of good microbrewery beer........and if i had a sister, i would want her to live in such a place.....
