         ok, so i am enjoying the letter-to-the-editor debate over the ten commandments and the bible vs. the state.  the letter yesterday from a guy from harrodsburg was pretty good (not as good as rachel's but right up there). he pointed out that the woman who wrote the inflammatory letter that started the debate was completely clueless about the origins of the pilgrims, the us consitution, etc.  neither the ten commandments nor the bible is mentioned in any way in the constitution- and the first ammendment clearly states that the us government cannot force religion upon its citizens-  this woman, and many like her, wish to force their religion on us.  speaking as a christian, i am personally offended when other 'christians' seem to think that God speaks only to them, and that somehow they and their take on God's message is the only way that it can be understood. this country was built on religious freedom- and that means freedom from having to deal with the religion of others in public places like schools, courthouses, etc.  the irony of it all is- if prayer was allowed in school, it would have to rotate between all of the religions represented in america- protestant, jew, catholic, greek orthodox,  hindi, islam, native american, buddhist. etc.  i would get of kick out of seeing the religious fanatics having to deal with a moment of zen meditation on every third thursday when the zen buddhists had their turn.........
