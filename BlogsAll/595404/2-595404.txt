         sticky hands turned out to be an ani defrnaco fan- this is cut/pasted from his latest blog;...  The Official Driving Song.. if you don't know it download it. it is our driving song... right em   Imperfectly- Ani DiFranco   i'm okay if you get me at a good angle and you're okay in the sort of light and we don't look like pages from a magazine but that's all right that's all right   i crashed your pickup truck and then i had to drive it back home i was crying i was so scared of what you would do of what you would say but you just started laughing so i started laughing along saying, it looks a little rough but it runs okay it looks a little rough but it runs good anyway   we get a little further from perfection each year on the road i guess that's what they call character i guess that's just the way it goes better to be dusty than polished like some store window mannequin why don't you touch me where i'm rusty let me stain your hands   when you're pretty as a picture they pound down your door but i've been offered love in two dimensions before and i know that it's not all it's made out to be let's show them how it's done let's do it all imperfectly     posted by Mo The Phoenix at 10:20:22 PM
