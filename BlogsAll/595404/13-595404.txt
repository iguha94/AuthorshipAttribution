         ok, so mean mamma regrets using the term 'pissed off' in yesterday's blog. she should have used a more interesting synonym like displeased, animosed, angered, enraged, indignant; exasperated, piqued, took umbrage of, huffed, miffed, in high dudgeon over, etc. yea, yea, yea, so I looked those up on thesaurus on-line, but it has been quite some time since mean mamma memorized the thesaurus.....speaking of which, it is not too soon for certain scholars she knows who wish to attend competitive colleges to start memorizing the thesaurus in preparation for the sat and act.  it would be deliciously ironic if one of my synonyms made cut in either of those tests- i give you permision in advance to chuckle aloud if one should be printed saucily on the page....  ernst and i really did enjoy the baseball game last evening in lexington. the park is small and each seat has a great view of the action, close enough to hear the crack of the bat and the muffled whoosh of the ball in the cather's mitt. we had sub sandwiches and ky ale, a quite nice beer with a nutty flavor that was surprisingly smooth- i have been bit before by local beers that were like sleeping dogs (a bit of a bite....)  the legends won 5-2, and we got home before 11:00 pm. i could have done without the dancing girls, the loud musical interjections (hit me with your best shot.....) and the constant commercials just below the big screen for replays. but this is america, and this is the stuff we do best.....
