         ok, so i have become so feeble at 46 going on 47 that i can no longer open  a twist-off bottle of beer without an opener.  My poor, arthritic hands cannot get a good enough grip to manage the job any longer.  This particular milestone is not listed on any stress-assessment questionnaire-but it should be.  when an otherwise healthy adult can no longer open her own beer without mechanical assitance- it is something like when i was first told i needed glasees- you ARE 40,and you should expect these things......glasses, maybe, grey hair, maybe, but the lack of twist-off capacity- now that is almost too frail for words.........maybe i will become like renoir- they will tape an opener in my hand- like he taped a brush in his arthritic hands.........as i blog- the simpsons are on- homer figured out long ago how to handle the twist-off thing- he only drinks draft beer at moes....homer is technically my age, by the way- he also graduated in 1974, though on one  episode he may not have actaully graduated but that is the story of homer's life......anyway- i have discovered that  i may not be able to serve draft beer in my own restaurant, even with a liquor license, until i find out if i will sell enough of any partiuclarkind to warrant buying a 1/2 keg that will stay fresh 35-45 days.....we  have no idea how many beers we will sell-  and i can't be drinking beer at work, or i will get no work done.  life is sometimes unkind.......
