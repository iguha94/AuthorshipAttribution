         OK, SO stephan and i heard a mortefying piece on npr on the way home from work today- it was about how the drug companies used propaganda to promote menopausal hormone use - since the 50's.........the one spot we heard was an older woman who said that she took hormone pills because she feared that her husband would leave her for an younger woman if she didn't.......i was so appalled that i almost wrecked the car- of course- the woman in the spot was complaining of her symptoms- hot flashes, lack of shortterm memory, and meannness.........but the part about her fears of her husband leaving her really upset me- this woman sounded like she lived only for her husband to come home from work- that was her first mistake....... she sounded very republican in that regard.... why didn't she have a life of her own, for gracious sakes.   i can recall meeting a woman at work when i first moved to town- who i asked to get together with sometime after work for a glass of wine- and she said she would have to ask her husband- same difference- she would probably ask her husband before taking hormones......in this regard i have to give kudos to ecw- he knew from the get-go that i was not likely to consult him on many issues at all- maybe financial ones- but then he wasn;t looking for an appendage, either.......young ones- beware of those males who are looking for unpaid personal slaves rather than full partners.........they are the kind who probably will leave you for a younger woman......
