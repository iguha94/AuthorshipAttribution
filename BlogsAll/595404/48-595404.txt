         ok, so i am blogging while i wait for wimbledon tennis ladies finals to come on.  while i lack the eye-hand coordination requires to play tennis (or most games, for that matter.....) i enjoy watching.  wimbledon is a bittersweet time for me- i recall clearly that chris evert was taking her final bow on the tv in the recovery room while i was coming out of anesthesia after surgury for an ectopic pregnancy. this was in 1989, i believe- i don't think about this event much, other than it dominoed into my travel habit.  i was off work for 6 weeks owing to the abdominal incision- and i got really depressed sitting around the house every day. a good friend suggested that we drive up to cincinnati to see the taft museum- we had such a good time that we decided that we might as well go to paris on our next trip. she and i ended up going 4 times total (to be fair the 4th trip was free using ffmiles). travel has always seemed to be a better investment in my mental health than counseling......... but i digress- back to wimbledon.  i started watching wimbledon because chris evert always played either in the semis ro the finals when i was growing up.  she was my age, so i was fascinated by her talent at an age when i seemed to lack any talent.  i would love to attend the tournament in person one day. i have seen the complex from the train, on our way to hampton court several years ago. ( i actually walked by roland garros in paris on my way to jardin de bagatelle- the most beautiful rose garden in the world, by the way....) all this talk of paris and wimbledon reminds me that i really want to go somewhere in january. i am saving every penny in hopes that some desparate airline will want to sell me a few cutrate tickets to somwhere i want to go........of course, i want to go everywhere........
