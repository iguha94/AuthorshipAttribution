         ok, so i watched amelie for a third time after sunday school today- yes, mean mamma skipped church so ernst and stephan could drive the van on a 'long explore' to blaton forest, near pine mountain. now, mean mamma could have been nice and agreed to go along, but no this is my 3 days off and i intend to do restful, lazy things like watch amelie for a 3rd time, take a nap, and then read-maybe on the back deck with a beer in my hand- sio anyway, ernst and stephan took off in the car, so i ordered chinese takeout and the rest of us feasted on sesame chicken and shrimp/chinese vegetables and hot/sour soup.  and i watched amelie for a third time- i really can't say enough about this movie- i guess it was so unexpected. i also watched the interviews on the second 'bonus' dvd- and learbed that the colors were digitally enhanced-especially the primary colors- to make them more brilliant and eyecatching- so the reds are more red and the greens are more green, and a blue lantern is present in some scenes to make it more french, i suppose (colette wrote by the light of her fanal bleu........) even amelie's haircut is french- angular and blunt at the same time.  having watched the 3rd time- in french with only english subtitles, i cannot say that i understand an ounce of more of french- i cannot seem to listen fast enough- the only thing i have definetly caught 'aujourd h'ui non', with subtitles 'not today'. not much for 3 viewing- what about the 6 and 7th viewings.........i will have to actually buy this dvd as andrew is taking back the dvd to his roommate today.......
