         ok, so i am having food flashbacks from college- there was a deli on my walk home from the home ec building. when i was feeling especially wealthy i would order an onion bagel sandwich- toasted- with turkey, mustard, provolone and mayo. it would be just as good without the turkey- as the onion and provolone flavors are the highlights.  i was thinking of this sandwich as a tried to recreate it with an onion bun, shredded mozzarella, turkey and mayo- ok but not quite as magical as the real thing.    after all of my cleaning yesterday, i filled a box of stuff to sort through and 'file' away. now martha stewart would be proud- because the box is actually a lined basket- but martha would have gone on and finished the sorting job right then and there- my box is sitting on the floor where i will ignore it until i cannot recall what sorts of things are in there and other stuff like clothes for the goodwill will get piled on top.  there are so many things that i cannot throw away- school things belonging to my children- i have every drawing ever made by my children- every piece of their poetry- every craft brought home from camp or school- every ribbon or computer-printed 'certificate' - every trophy. each child has a big plastic lidded tub (or two) filled with stuff. i suspect that the basket is filled with my stuff- i cannot tthrow away stuff like tickets from trips, brochures from places visited- i know in the basket there is a ticket stubb from the art musuem in brussels- now a ticket stub is not much use once one leaves the museum, and i am not going back to brussels any time soon- but i know that i willnot throw away that ticket.  if i had a lick of sense i would go upstairs right now, get that ticket, and tape it inside my travel notebook from that trip- and get  it all over with........of course, that would still leave a basket filled with other stuff.....maybe tomorrow........
