         ok, so we have a guest speaker at church today, and mean mamma would just as soon stay home- rather, mm would rather go back to bed and sleep til she has gotten over this overwhelming fatigue that comes with working all day saturday.  alas, if mm doesn't go to church on just one sunday, her little ones will start thinking that church is optional, and moral decay will break out, she is certain.    speaking of moral decay, mm failed to watch the miss america pageant on tv last night. this breaks a 40+ year streak of watching this spectacle- mostly to watch the clothes and to see if miss ohio, i mean miss ky won anything.....there was once a girl who lived down the hill from my grandparents in independence, ohio that won the title. they pointed out her parents nursery and plant stand every time we passed by until they both passed away. ah well, instead, ecw and i watched this french movie with english subtitles- pierrot le fou, by jean-luc goddard and starring jean-paul belmondo- a 60's movie that was quite surreal and hard to follow- not because of language but because they would inexplicably have on different clothes when you knew that had no luggage (being on the run) and you didn't see them steal any......... the whole time jean-paul belmondo kept writing poetry in his journal- and the girl wouldn't understand it and he would tell her that he wasn't sure if he loved her if she couldn't understand his most intimate thoughts.  i didn't stay up til the end because i was tired. i was also bummed out because acw didn't come home this weekend. i really miss that boy.......
