         ok, so since mean mamma is 'off' til the restaurant reopens 1/20/03, she is deternined to complete some nesting chores that would otherwise not happen during the normal work year......a sofa and a loveseat have been sent out to be recovered, several drawers have been cleaned out, and a few wallpapering projects have been sketched out.....the first one- the kitchen happened because the fabric for the sofa in the back room clashed with the current paper. yes, these things are not in the same room, but theyare quite visible to the flow of things, and so mm pulled the old paper off the walls and put up a nice stripe- the job tool only 1 roll- which mm purchased for a whopping $5...............alas, everyproject has it's downside-  when i pulled out the refrigerator to clean underneath and to strip the paper behind it, i musthave pulled loose the connection to the icemaker.......about the time ecw got home from work the kitchen was flooded in a lucy ricardo sort of way.........oh my.........having a handy husband is a good thing.......we had time to make chinese after cleaning up......yes make chinese....we made hot and sour soup, a shrimp and veggie lo mein and eggrolls using a chinese cookbook by a certain madame woo passed downfrom ecw's mother.  nothing i made tasted quite like chinese takeout, but it was edible and hot and may be practice will make perfect.  for starts, my eggrolls were the size of small burritos- i did enjoy the  tofu- both in the soup andin the lo mein.....we don't cook tofu often enough.....  i am blogging rather than studying my sunday school lesson- this is a problem in that today is my turn to teach......ecw has decided to go to mass this morning....we will miss church to get to his brother's luncheon cincinnati on time.....he has not been to mass since his mother's funeral- in fact he has only gone to mass at funerals for at least 15 years- when we settled on a church......the reasons that i won't go to the catholic church will not be disclosed in this forum......and predate the current scandals.....
