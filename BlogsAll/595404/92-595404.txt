         ok, so i work monday then i am off til january 20- well- kind of, because there will be lots to do the week before we reopen in order to actually open back up...so really i am only off til monday the 14th. i will be doing things like repainting shelves and the kitchen floor...the stuff that never gets done any other time except when we are closed.  i have great hopes of re-wallpapering the upstairs bathroom and the kitchen- maybe in the same pattern, stripes on cream backround that goes with everything up and down.... its on the sale rack at jordan's and buying all they have at $5 a roll will kill '2 birds with one stone' as they say....i have also called an upolsterer about the front room loveseat and the backroom sofa- both will be recovered while i am off work- as both are in the worst shape......then if i still have strength and/or time i want to make window 'treatments' for above the mini-blinds in the back room- i just can't decide how to go about it as the french door to the deck opens up about 7 inches from the ceiling and snags anything that hangs down too far.....of course, if we are talking projects, i could organize the giant box of photos- about 3 years worth- and put them in albums...when i win the lottery, i will hire a personal assistent to do these things, of course.........
