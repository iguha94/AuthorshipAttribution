         ok, so i swam laps, came back up to the house after drying off, and got right on the computer........just like i said, i got right on the computer. gentle readers, this phenomena is quite curious- i might take days to get used to the novetly....kind of like people unused to running water who keep turning on the faucet just to see the water running out.  stephan is occupied with moving his stuff into his new room- which is twice the size of his old room, with a double bed and a double sleeper sofa and room for several sleeping bags- it is a veritable party palace compared to his old room and the room he had before that.  alas, we have not yet put up the bookcases to house his personal library- we think it will take at least 7-8 shelves to accomodate his collection- even after he gave up his collection of eyewitness books to his sister.......this family has an obsene(obcene, obscene?) number of books- for which i am unapologetic....which is why our favorite family destination is j.beth and my favorite web site is half.com (i can buy used hardbacks for less than new paperbacks....) i am now rushing through the elizabeth george mysteries, alongside pbs new series of dramatised george mysteries.  the second partof a 2-parter is on tonight, and i do not yet know who-done-it.........many thanks to mona wyatt who suggested that i might like her work- english but not traditionally stodgy or trite.  in the novel i finished last night, one of the murder victims liked to wax her entire body so that there would be no hair whatsoever----quite curious....speaking of england, virgin atlantic has ultra cheap fares to london this fall.....i am not in the mood for london- i would rather go to paris if i must go somewhere.......
