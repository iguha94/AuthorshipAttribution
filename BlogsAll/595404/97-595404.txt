         ok. so i am up much earlier than i would like, as we have a brunch thismorning...some sort of shower.....the timing is laughable, as if it is a baby shower, the poor mamma would rather be in the bed til the sun is way up and if she is getting married, well,  let's not go there.......we had reservations for about 30 last night, and ended up feeding 60...we ran out of almost everything...the last customers got the last 6 stalks of asparagus......in the lex herald leader, in the saturday section on gardeing/decorating/ etc there is an article featuring a mother and daughter in their new sunny laundry room,,,which appears to be bigger than my family room, along with cathedral ceiling and cabinets nicer than i have in my kitchen........now that i am starting on kitchens.....let me just say that in my 2.5 years of catering i find that the people who have the kitchens hire caterers for parties and eat out.....which means they spent a lot of cash on the grand spaces with high-tech counters, equipment, cabinets, etc...and use them basically on thanksgiving and christmas.....on the other hand the people who actually cook in their kitchens tend to make do with minimalist space and equipment......where is this rant going?  gentle reader, please do not presume than the mean mamma is bitter that she does not have a grand kitchen....if i had the cash to buy a better kitchen, i would spend it on plane tickets, hotels, and rental cars in far away places...........and still make do with the kitchen i have.....i am thinking about investing in a new pasta pot, however............
