         ok, so i entertain myself while cooking by imagining trip scenarios. the following is le voyage de jour:  day 1- fly to paris day 2 arrive in paris; lunch in a recommended place- something nice like la bookiniste on the left bank; dash into ste, chapelle for a quick look at windows if it is sunny; maybe go to a museum i haven't vitied before like cognac-jay(sp!) or another one of the house museums; nice supper and to bed early. day 3- sleep in very late; lunch at a cute place; visit louvre with emphasis on newer wing that i haven't fully seen even in 2 visits....; supper and to bed early day 4 early tgv to bordeaux (about 3 hours); lunch then visit to regional museum with replica of lasceaux (sp) Or rather lacrosse caves maybe a wine tasting at wine institute;          supper then to bed early (this will be winter and we really got tired in europe the last cold weather trip.....) day 5 train to san sebastian- tapas lunch then on to see the new opera house and sculpture museum; tapas supper  day 6- bilbao- lunch at museum; supper in the pelli shopping area day 7- bilbao?  day 8- train back to biarritz? to back to bordeaux to catch tgv to paris day 9- paris- maybe train to melun to see vaux-le-vicomte, a spectacular chateaux built before versailles- by the same craftsmen and architect day 10- paris- maybe trip to malmaison, josephine's chateaux day 11- home  i don't speak spanish, so a brief dash into spain may be the best for my first visit.  i understand that ms. bennet has included barcelona on her dream trip for spring break.......i would not want my dream trip to be similar to her trip in any way........  i could, at this very moment be preparing for my 6:00 class at eku-danville, but i am not doing so.........
