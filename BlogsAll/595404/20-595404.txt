         ok, i am going to pay tribute to a left -field candidate. tonight i gave a prom dinner for my 2 independent study students paige and caelin, and kelly the daughter of one of my servers.  14 students attended, and the only guest (other than paige and caelin) to really say thanks was sara wilson.  those who have followed the crown=webers since birth know that sara wilson has been in andrew's class since age 3 (montessori through 5th grade then bate then dhs). that means that i have known her for at least 15 years.  she looked like a million bucks, by the way, getting out of her dates mercedes convetable-  she is going to uk like acw, and i have offered a rec letter for sorority rush.  she was gracious and lovely in a princess grace kind of way- i would like to say the same of andrew/s date but he didn't bring her by the restaurant. ........  there has been much said about the racial mix at this party- caelin's mother has called about the particularl's more than once.....i have had much time to think about the race issue this week since learning that i have black kinfolk....i am especially pleased that my brother took this news well= he intends to research the black side of our family- i find it a relief- an instant point of reference that i lacked in this southern town- i feel blessed to be related to both underground railroad germans, and northern blacks- it kind of makes up for the lambsheim nazis and the northern ohio kkk kin.   anyway, my upwardly mobile brother intends to research my black heritage, and i amhappy- it could'nt be worse than my mormon heritage.....
