         ok, so my leisurely morning habits of getting up at 7, reading the paper over coffee on the deck til 7:30 then checking email and blogwriting til 8 end today.  frankly the reality of school-year mornings is not appealing- the dragging of reluctant bodies out of bed, and cojoling to come on downstairs and eat something before the car leaves, the finding of half-eaten bagels under seats.....the forgetting of lunch money, pencils, books, entire backpacks.......the getting of children to school before the tardy bell rings.......all of this means that i get to work 40 minutes earlier than i have done so this summer. in terms of work this is not all bad, but in terms of personal quiet time this is tragic.    speaking of quiet time, i have taken to swimming laps between our dock and the neighbors dock.  the water is getting just a hint of chill, especially yesterday when the day was cloudy with a few scattered clouds.  i hope to swim through september before starting to walk with books on tape again.  nothing compares to swimming- however. i believe that this horiscope thing has some base in human nature- both i and my daughter (pisces and aquarius) find much joy in the water.  the chill goes away when the laps start, but not before i imagine such endeavors such as swimming the english channel- i am not near enough of a real swimmer to undetake such a thing- but the cool water makes me think of heading toward france across the choppy waves.........
