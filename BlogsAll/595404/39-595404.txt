         i enjoyed reading the loyal opposition's review of valmont.  that movie is a remake of sorts of liasons dangerouse (sp) starring john malkovich and glen close as the mean courtesan and michelle pffiefer and uma thurman.  i have seen both, and felt that both movies did a good job at conveying the utter cuthroat culture that was the aristocracy.  however, no one does cuthroat like glen close (think cruella deville........) that liasons role may have gotten her all of the 101 dalmation remakes.  i sought out valmont just to watch colin firth- who i enjoyed in pride and predjudice. he apparantly went on to have a baby with meg tilly who was also in the movie-i did not find her role near as believable as when played by michele pffeifer.  no. colin is not the man of my dreams (bridgit jones diary certainly cured me of that) as i am married to the man of my dreams- however, he has brief moments of handsomeness riddled through out his movies that i find appealing.  speaking of men of my dreams- i am eternally grateful that i didn't grow up in the era of arranged marriages- one would usually find oneself married to an old geezer just because his connection to my family was advantageous to my parents.  of course, i suppose that some women still are willing to marry old rich geezers, but at least it is their choice and they have no one to blame but themselves........  speaking of costume pictures- i regret that i never got around to seeing the importance of being earnest at the ky theatre in its umptennth remake.  this one has the usual cast of characters who do such films- many who were in gosford park as well as reese witherspoon of all people.
