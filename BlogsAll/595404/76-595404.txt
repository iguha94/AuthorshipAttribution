         ok, so i am on the last moments of my 'vacation' and i have not gotten much rest and relaxation-  andrew pointed out at lunch today that my vacations have always been more frantic than restful- so what was my point?  i attended a workshop on diabetes this morning at st joseph hospital, then took andrew to lunch and for some shopping, then saw 2 clients for dr. hempel, and came home.  not bad for my last vacation day.......i got lost trying to find andrew's dorm- and had to park the car and go in to get him because he had not turned on his cell phone........we ate at j.beth- whereupon i bought stephan another book by the fight club guy- called choke- which the salesperson raved about and told me most of the plot, which i will not reveal hwere in that he told me that it might be too risque for a 15 year old boy.........oh well- i assigned the sun also rises to my spanish travelers, which is risque for people of any age......after lunch i bought andrew yet another coat- which he will certainly lose- he has lost more coats at 18 than i have ever owned in 46 years......i cannot imagine losing something as essential to survival as a coat....he has even lost some of my coats, and his dad's coats............but there he was, shivering in a short sleeve shirt, looking all pitiful and vulnerable.....what is a mother to do.....
