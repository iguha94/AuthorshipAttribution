         ok, so i have always suspected that clients whitewash their personal accounts of foods eaten at any given meal to make their weight problem seem less like their fault.  today, i was understandingly shocked when a client admitted to the following lunch:  big mac at mcdonalds, which she consumed while driving to arby's where she ordered a chicken cordon bleu and a regular arby's roast beef, which she consumed before she got home so her husband wouldn't find out.  whoa............if that eating scenario is one that she will own up to, i wonder what she actually eats in any given day- and it is not like her husband doesn't really know that she overeats..........i used to know this woman- who appears to have gained 100 pounds over the past 2 years- now that is a real feat- to gain 50 pounds a year 2 years running. notice, by the eway that no identifying info has been provided, as not to violate patient/therapist trust- but really- how does one gain 100 pounds in 2 years without noticing until now that eating has gotten out of hand. my extra pound or two makes me just a bit more mean than usual........imagine how mean that mean mamma would be with 100 extra.........yerhhhhh  i broke down yesterday and bought the dvd of lotr- even though the version coming out in november has lots of unseen footage and will be much cooler.  i cannot wait til november- i could probably wear out this disk by november.  many parts still surprise me ,even after seeing it on the big screen, and having read the books twice over in anticipation of the films.  i do like the scenery and the special effects like the giant statues guarding the lake at the end, and the whole of rivendell- which looks like a thomas kincaid painting with its own special glow.
