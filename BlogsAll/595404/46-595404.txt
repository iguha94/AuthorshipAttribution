         ok, so i am upset about time magazine's reporting of julia robert's marriage to her cameraman. time made much light of it, and hoped her much happiness for as long as it lasts.  i am saddened that time would publically comment on such things as marital happiness. i believe that anyone who opts to tie the knot has at least a 50/50 shot at being married forever. and who is to say that a famous wife cannot find marital bliss with a nonfamous person- or that a famous person can only be content with someone with equal billing on the marquee.  so her marriage to lyle lovett didn't last, so what.  so she ran out on her marriage to kiefer sutherland right before the wedding, so what.  my in-laws were married for over 50 years, and argued almost every day- is that happiness or just the desire to finish what you started? in fact, my parents and both sets of grandparents and at least 1 set of greatgrandparents were married over  50 years- and that doesn't prove the happiness question. i only like to think that they were happy years spent together on the mutual project of raising children, keeping a house and property in decent repair, working, and having a bit of enjoyable spare time on the side.  i like to think that i will be off somewhere with ernst on our 50th wedding anniversary- maybe biking in france (between small inns with great wine and fabulous food)- it takes a lot of work to stay married. julia might just have found the only person worth putting in the time and effort to stay married. lets give her the benefit of the doubt.  woody allen once said ( or therabouts) 80% of life is just showing up.......so far. julis is right on target.
