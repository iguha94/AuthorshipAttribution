         ok, so i read this morning in lexherleader about centre's columbarium, by old centre, where for a fee centre grads may pay to have their ashes spend eternity.  no mention of centre's price- but u of richmond charges $3000 while u of va charges only $1800. article also vague on whether non-centre grads can pay to be interred in this location- whether pubically educated ashes may lay near centre educated remains.  OR whether dogs of centre grads may be interred, regardless of where their degree was earned.......maybe a tiered approach could be lucrative for centre:  for an extra $1000 we will have an eternal flame burning in front of your remains (for an extra $500 we will simply make it glow......)  for an extra $10,000 we will allow for your mistress to be interred with you, and we promise that your wife will never know.....  for an extra $100,000 we will posthumously award a bfa to your spouse and/or mistress or to whoever is interred with you....  for an extra $1,000,000 the board of trustees will hold a candlelight vigil by your remains on the anniversary of your death, every year, even in the rain or snow.......  just a few suggestions......   enough of this- lets talk about the many frightful glamour don'ts seen in danville yesterday- one woman in particular strands out- literally. she was getting into a minivan at dq- a very large woman wearing a neon tie-dyed mu-mu of sorts- tie-dye done to that large a garment ends up looking like a bulls-eye. that woman could have been targeted from space........of course, if she is a centre grad, there may be a 6 x 6 inch box waiting for her near old centre.......
