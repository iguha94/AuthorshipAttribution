         ok, so i enjoyed the bridal shower i catered today, for the wrong reasons. after it was over, i ran by the kroger store to get what i need to make my annual back-to-school lasagnas for friends who teach.  there were so many humorous folks at the store during that random time slot- i am still laughing. i was looking for the frozen ravioli when i came upon an aquaintance from a 'prior workplace' munching down on a free ice cream sample, and turned the corner and came upon yet another prior aquaintance doing the same thing.  they both looked guilty as hell to be caught in the midst of eating ice cream- like it was a sin or something. finally i saw the actual ice cream sample lady- and she offered  me a sample- which i refused.  she got kind of indignant, with me refusing her ice cream- but i don'[t like ice cream all that much, i attempted to explain. not like ice cream? she exclaimed as if disliking icecream is akin to being a communist. no, i do not care particularly for ice cream,  i do like graeter's raspberry chocolate chip, but that is about it.  there are 2 cartons in my freezer right now, and i will not have one bowl from either container because ice cream simply doesn't appeal to any of my taste buds nor sensory cells.  not like salty, crunchy foods- i particularly like salt and vinegar potato chips, especially the special onion flavor salt and vinegar potato chips.  i believe that this particular food is a gift from God directly to me.  and with a glass of good beer, there may be no finer taste combination.  gos bless america i wish i had a bag of salt and vinegar potato chips............
