         ok, so we catered a dinner last night, to which attendees brought "their own"  as in byob.  such a motley assortment of bottles when the event was over- wine of course, some drank whiskey mixed with diet coke- but the most intriguing were the wine coolers.  understand that mean mamma is not a fan of overly sweet foods/beverages of any kind- so overly sweet cooler concoctions that mix together cranberry juice with kiwi and white zinfandel sound disgusting- and look worse- like a jonestown cocktail of death.  i think that one wasd called harbor mist or amber mist or something just as banal.  of course, i don't like white zinfandel plain- i find it too sweet.   this crowd was exclusively from out of town- but some things are the same all over- one woman missed most of the festivities because she was constantly out of the dining room on her cell phone- talking to her kids, returning phone messages, telling people to 'look on the table in the back room' over and over like somehow it would be found on the table in the back room if she mentioned it enough.  i am not sure that she actually ate any of the appetizers- which were lovely, by the way. i did a delicious layered marinated vegetable display- in a dill dressing- the marinated mushrooms were wonderful, along with a baked brie.  sometimes food is the better part of my day...........back to the cell phoen addict- at one point she had gone to the bathroom, and her cell phone- in her purse- was rining once again- and someone at her table took it to her- while she was in the bathroom!!!! just to stop it from ringing.  you would think that this woman would have taken the hint and turned it off- just to be sociable.......
