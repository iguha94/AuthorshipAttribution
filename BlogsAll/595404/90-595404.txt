         ok, so mean mamma is blogging and listening to her cd-mix (along with ecw's mic) RATHER than watch  stuart little 2 on dvd. she is also 1500+ in the hole on solitare, but that is only a problem if this were real money.... i marvel at the insight that went into these mixes- it is as if acw took mental note of every song i have ever said i loved....scw gave me lavender things, another favorite of mine....on the other hand, my own mother gave me a striped turtleneck eerily like one she gave me in 1973 that i also disliked intensely......scw tried to warn her that i wouldn't like it, he told me later, but she wouldn't have any of that.......how can someone i have known all of my life know me so little?  that is a question that therapy wouldn't begin to touch, so i will leave it at that........my partner and my husband gave me a gifts almost identical- which means each pays attention...they are different enough to keep both, happily.......  at this point in the blog, mean mamma will disclose the things she bought for herself while buying for others.....a lovely set of french toile-print desk accessories in burgundy and cream (and the reverse)- a standup file, notecards, several picture albums and a journal.  had my family seen them first, each would have exclaimed....oh my, mamma would just love these.......but alas, scw had his hands full during that visit to marshall's and no one else was there.. i was obliged to buy them from my loving family, in abstentia........now all i have to do is clean off my desk and they will look lovely.....
