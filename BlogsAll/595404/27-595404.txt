         ok, so we are not yet 48 hours into this 2 week bicycle thing, and already those of us left behind in danville are pretty fed up with grandma's dog, muffet. she is a maltese, rescued from a puppy farm, and should evoke sympathy rather than disdain.  however, one cannot  move about in this houyse without that dog underfoot, with her toenails making noises on the tile floor. i keep stepping on her feet because she is always underfoot.  she cannot just lay upon the couch (yea, we don't let our dogs lay on the furniture......) and just chill out- no she has to follow us around l;ike she will miss something if she isn't close art hand.    andrew and i walked last night, around the circle, after it had cooled off (somewhat).  we were on our 3 or 4th lap when a lowe's truck pulled up in front of my mother's house.  we both looked at each other- what did she buy and why didn't she tell us to expect a truck, and she certainly doesn't need what she bought........turns out if was a false alarm- they were looking for an address on gwinn island road not the circle- and they finally drove off.  such relief.  with my dad in the nursing home, we are quite protective of how my mother spends her money........when we bring in her mail we sift through all fo the catalogs, special offers, and the like for immediate discard..........
