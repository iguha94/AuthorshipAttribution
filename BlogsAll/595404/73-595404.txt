         ok, so i watched amelie again last night- since the dvd was still here i thought i had better get my fill of it.......i liked it even better the second time,despite knowing how it ends, because i could pay attention to it nuances- the cartoon-like simplicity of each sequence- the director drew it like like a cartoon on a story board to make sure that it was filmed exactly like he imagined it- kind of like a graphic novel put on videotape.....to keep things simple, there are not many 'extra' people in this film- not many people on the street in street scenes, or in bar scenes- amelie's paris is quite uncrowded- i would really like this version of paris, frankl....i also like the parts where amelie gets into the mean grocer's apartment and plays tricks on him.  and the parts where amelie's father waits for the mail to bring him photos of his garden dwarf statue, who is traveling the world.  be warned, this is not a movie for the young ones- there is just enough sex (funny sex, but sex nonetheless....)to warrant an r rating. cayle was quite ticked off to be sent out of the room when we realized........half.com sells this dvd for about $16.94 including shipping- it may be the next movie i watch until my family begs me to 'find something else'  mind you,  i watch the 6 part a&e video series of pride and prejudice so much that when questions arose on the ap exam about this book, andrew was able to answer with much certainty- he got a 5 on the english ap, by the way.......maybe stephan will get a 5 on the french ap if i start watching amelie without the subtitles every day for the next 3 years........
