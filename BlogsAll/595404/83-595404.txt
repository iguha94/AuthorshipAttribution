         ok, so there is a bright side to a funeral- all of the nice cards and letters.  i look forward to the mail, because every day seems to bring another bundle of tender words and thoughtfulness.  i received an unexpected note from a boy i haven't seen since i was in the 5th grade- he read dad's obit in the Millersburg, Ohio Daily Record. i was born in millersburg ohio, and occassionally feel melancholy about the move away- anyway, i was able to put my hands on a picture of max miller within 5 minutes of reading the note-  it seems that the year i got my first camera- for my birthday in 1967- i brought it to school, and took pictures of my friends on the playground- his was the first, and so he has been the first photo in my first album for the past 35 years........he was just adorable then- i wonder how he has grown up.  anyway, it was nice for him to write....i think of millersburg and elementary school whenever the assassination of jfk comes up- i was in the second grade and can see clearly the classroom, and the shock that came over us when the announcement came over the loadspeaker, and we were instructed to go home for the rest fo the day......it ended up being several days, as i watched the funeral procession on tv at home........i will always feel a  special bond to people i was with on that day- our generations 9-11, of sorts.
