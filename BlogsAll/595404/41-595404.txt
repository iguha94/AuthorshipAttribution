         ok, so i ate like a pig at the food show- and i am quite embarassed at the things i tasted- there must be some latent fried food gene deep within my body that wants fried foods when presented with them in heated displays- fried mushrooms. fried cauliflower, fried zucchini, fried cheese, french fries in assorted shapes and seasonings....it just went on and on. i did have a plum off of the fruits and vegetables display.....we got there early and left early- and missed the party with the free drinks that my workmates were looking forward to, but we were all stuffed and tired, and so drove back to danville. on the way back, we made up stories about people in the cars that passed us- like 'she is behind on her car payments and her boyfriend is in jail' i stuff like that. there were several very funny stories but i can't recall them because i was driving.  last night we looked at the pile of photos that ernst had developed over the weekend- when he announced that he was going to develop pictures from thebike trip- all sorts of undeveloped film canisters came forth from drawers and other hiding spots- we had pictures from las vegas- a trip at least 3 years ago, from dc/philly with 8th grade, which included a really cute wide angle photo of petra and one of betty, also pictures of stephan in the hospital in iowa when he got dehydrated during the bike trip there, also christmas pictures from 2 years ago while my dad was still living across the street and able to open presents.  there were pictures from heidlburg and amsterdam.  many good pictures that didn't get developed for whatever reason.....
