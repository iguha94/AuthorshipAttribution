         ok, so my last blog, the one about wilma brown, has disappeared.  wilma brown is my new hero/heroine, based on her brave decision to publically get signatures on a wet-dry petition so that the fine citizens of boyle county can decide for themselves whether or not alcohol may be legally consumed in these environs.  i don't know which makes me madder- theblog vanishing or the fact that i have to drive 27 miles to buy a bottle of wine.  i am also unsure about the correct term for wilma- hero or heroine- heroine somehow makes me think of cheap romance novels- not brave female role models.  wilma is perfect for this role- she has retirement income, as well as private funds from painting, which are nearly immune from economic pressure from the opposition- someone like myself, whose livelihood depends on public goodwill, could easily be bankrupted by those who dislike my opinion on alcohol sales.  further, wilma has no children nor spouse, who can also be subjected to public riducule/personal attacks based on wilma's actions.  presumably she isn't worried about getting kicked out of her church.......an aside- when i bought the restaurant, i was told by a co-worker that i would probably be kicked out of my church if i allowed customers to bring in their own alcohol or if i eventually sold it myself in the event of a successful wet-dry vote.  i replied that i would simply rename the place cana- as in the wedding at can where jesus turned water into wine- and let the opposition throw the first stone........i run into people from my church at the liquor barn - so i am clearly not the only one in my congregation, nor in my sunday school class who imbibes....  so back to wilma, she has many connections, with many subgroups in danville- the intellecutals, the college, the artistic, the librarians/teachers, the gentry- i can see her getting the signatures by august, and getting this thing on the ballot by november.  where do i sign., wilma?
