         ok, so my alma mater is one game closer to winning a national championship. Ohio State beat Michigan 14-9 in a nail-biter game yesterday afternoon in its signature horseshoe stadium. so sweet.   of course, i did not see the actual ending, as i had to go to work- that is probably why they won- because i wasn't watching. i hadn't watched a game all season (mostly because osu games aren't aired around here......) i musn't jinx the team by watching jan 3- regardless, a national title would be abittersweet memorial for my dad, the ultimate osu fan. i have many fond memories of attending osu games with him- stopping for mcdonalds lunch on the way, which was a treat then- we NEVER stopped for fast food unless we were on vacation or going to a football game.  we would proceed from the parking 'field' to st john's arena where we would listen to the band warm-up- then on to the game.  i remember seeing the osu-michigan game with my dad when woody hayes was still coaching, and the stadium was going to astroturf- after the game (osu won...) the students took down the goalposts and carried them down high street- and the alums took out shovels and trash bags and literally scooped up the playing field as souveniers(sp)...........everybody wanted a little bit of osu turf for their own yards......remarkable.  i did get to see osu beat michigan in ann arbor- when i was in grad school and dating a boy who went to grad school at michigan.....michigan has a bottle law- so after the game- people got out trash bags and started picking up cans and bottles to get back the deposits- it was a remarkable thing to see........
