         ok, so my sisterinlaw lisa spent a curious amount of time over the weekend telling me about the kind of hair rinse she uses- the name, the number of shampoos it is good for before it fades, the colors that turn out darker than promised, etc.  curious, because i cannot yet detect grey in my hair, and because i am not yet sure that i want to mess with keeping up with hair rinses, let alonr permanent hair color changes.  i sat yesterday in church gazing at the back of heads (we always sit in the balcony and with renovation we now sit in the very back...) so many women fail to keep up with their roots, and sometimes this can have embarrassing results.  there was a dhs cheerleader there yesterday with her boyfriend who was there with his grandmother (how is that for vague....) and her blond and brown phases met in a stripe somewhere down the middle of her back- at this point she could either bleach the whole mess blonde again, or get her hair cut short so that the distinct blond ends were gone.  sadly, she probably sees only the front, rahter than the striped back, but surely the sides have the same skunk-like look.  maybe there is a third choice- that she likes it all this way and plans to keep it up.  ah well, she wasn't alone in the roots growing out visibly category- most women i noticed had grey roots peeking out from either blonde,  golden brown, or auburn tresses- nobody seemed to have chosen darker shades for covering grey.  unless this coloring thing is done at home it could be expensive- many of thesre women seem to be the kind who have weekly hair appointments and do not wash or style their own hair in between.  how does this habit happen- the weekly appointment and the trusting of someone else to wash ones hair but once a week? i cannot go one day without washing my hair, let alone 7 days.  i would rather have a bad hair day with clean hair than a good hair day with an unwashed head.  something to ponder as one ages........
