         ok, so my catering job gave me new perspective on just how tidywe keep our operation and just how disgusting other kitchens can get.  we did a xmas party- dinner for 120- at a 'golf resort' in a neighboring county. the kitchen was huge- but incredibly gross- there was a turkey breast- whole, wrapped in original wrap- just sitting on the counter- by the uncleaned slicer- leftoverfrom some lunch event- now this was 4:30 and the  prep for lunch would have been over by 12- you do the math- i put the turkey in the closest working fridge- and went on with unloading my van.  the stove, convectionoven, broiler, and line of 4 fryers did not look like they had been cleaned, emptied of sludge or otherwise serviced since installation.  the stench of grease was overwhelming-someone has attempted to skim some of the grease sludge off the top of one fryer, and the bucket of greasey slime mixed with french fry crumbs was still sitting on the floor- you get the picture........the party crowd was no better- they all seemed to be smokers- and the party hall had only a limited # of ashtrays- so this high-class group used their uneaten salads as ashtrays. this is the first time i have ever seen one of my salads come back with a cigarette out out in the little dressing cup...........the banquet hall was a smoky cave- with that clinging, nicotine yellow film that settles on everything and permeates the clothing and the hair...........it will take us all several days to get 'over' this event.......
