         ok, so i was wrong about byron white- though he was nominated by jfk, he voted against roe v wade and against other pro-choice questions that came before the court.  with the senate in control of the senate, w will have a hard time getting through a candidate that is too right wing.....at least i hope that is the case.....  on the way to work, npr ran a story about the manhattan bulb project. on 9/12, the director of parks in manhattan received a call from a bulb grower inholland, asking how he could help- this grower personally sent 500,000 daffodil bulbs, and the city of rotterdam sent another 500.000 bulbs.  volunteers planted them in as many bleak sections of the city ass they could manage- this week they are in bloom- a city reborn.......of course, i teared up as the story ran, because it struck me as such a sweet gesture on the part of the dutch, a population that shares some of my roots.  i find it ironic that sentimental news clips can bring me to tears, while trench-warfare with andrew at home, with him screaming in my face - doesn't evoke that emotional response.  maybe he justs wants to see me cry, and maybe thats why i just won't.    i have done some checking about my dream getaway to spain. the plane tickets are $700+ at this point, the train doesn't go straight from barcelona to bilbao- goes through madird for a major time consuming stour, and plane tickets from barcleona to bilbao rt are $271- there is going to have to be a major price-war special fares thing going before this trip will happen any time soon.....
