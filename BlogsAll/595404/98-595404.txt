         ok, so when my husband cleaned out the crawl-space in the eaves beside our bedroom, he came up with some unexpected things.....among them a portfolio of art pieces i did in a class at osu...my one and only art class which explains why i majored in a science.....there is a self-portrait, a collage, a textural piece, a van gogh wannabe, the requisite charcoal drawing of a cylinder, block, etc,........i will store these along with the 'portrait' done of me by my boyfriend freshman year...which portrays me as a clown....he must have thought he was being clever....crown/clown..... get it?   he found many of his college belongings...among them reel-to-reel tapes and a tape player......lots of jazz, blues, etc.....one doesn't see reel-to-reel anymore.....  somewhere i might be able to lay my hands on poetry i wrote in college and graduate school......certainly not too involved nor rhythymicbut mine......i also have some pen and ink drawings that i have framed and on display that i did in graduate school as a form of procrastination.....again, not particularly good, but matted and framed and placed with framed photographs they are almost pleasing.....  tonight david anderson and a group of centre people ate at trc as part of an interview process......i always greet d.a. with condolences that the nobel committee excuded him yet another year......i generally joke and say that david is my only shot at actually knowing a nobel winner.....he always laughs, but he really believes down deep that he will win one day.........anyway, this time i had to stop and think, because there are so many talented people in the current sophomore class.....i may actually know a future nobel poet/literature laureate......of course, she keeps changing her web page, just when i was really liking the blinking, sultry eyes......
