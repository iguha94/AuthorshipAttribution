         ok, so i can't spell byron correctly. we two-finger typists, who lack the dexteritity to use all fingers to tap keys at will, have to do the best we can with what we have got.....andrew appears to have tremondous typing skills- he appears to be able to type faster than he can write.  i took a summer typing course in high school, assuming that i would need to know how to type papers when i got to college. i seem to recall using a borrowed portable typewriter in my dorm room- maybe i still have it somewhere. typing on a real keyboard is a greater challenge than a computer steup- it takes more pressure to depress the keys.  my biggest mistakes were in the switching of letters- like bryon versus byron- i used up a lot of white out in the days before spell check.    i watched 24 with ernst last night. i have not seen all of the episodes, and feel a bit lost at some points when i can't quite follow the many plot lines. there are 4 'hours' to go and lots of explaining to do in this far-fetched tale. happily i walked 20 minutes on the treadmill so the time wasn't a total bust.  i find as i get older that television is not my primary choice for entertainment- i would rather sit in a hot tub, drink a cold beer, and read a book. the conservative right in boyle county would prefer that i drive 28 miles to get that beer, as the purchase locally would corrupt our youth, cause litter on our streets, and mayhem with the inevitable drivers under the influence. youth have been corrupted for centuries- socrates was convicted of corrupting youth in a time when beer and wine were the only beverages available. how silly the moralists are when it comes to 'protecting' society.....even christ drink a glass or two of wine with his friends, but the right wingers would have us to believe that it was really grape juice in his glass.....  enough of these rantings- i have got to get to work, cook some food, and get on with the day.
