         ok, so we made it to cincinnati, and lived through our first encounter with sister elaine since the ecw's mother's funeral. her husband did not come- he stayed with the sister of their oldest son's wife (get the connection) who lives down the street from ecw's sister lisa.  i thought it a might cowardly that mike did not come, as we all knew he was down the street. but it was nice to talk a bit with elaine about spain, and to have her confirm that castillian spanish has many different pronunciations than latin american spanish.....and that the c before an i or e comes out as th........also a doubble ll, like in tortilla comes out with a j sound, like tortija......her 2 daughters were there, and her oldest son and his wife and new baby......they didn't come until after ecw's brother jim and his wife left for their house in gatlinburg for th weekend......ah well....today we venture north to my home town, for the second and last memorial service.  i will be seeing all of my ohio relatives on both sides of the family, as well as a few school friends of my own...a very few.....i am not the sort who keeps up with just anybody... i have made a point over the years to keep up with only those people who i really like and hope to actually see again......therefor, my address book is not crowded with people i barely remember and cannot really place anymore.......there are really good utlets on the way there-  maybe we can stop on the way home.....a visit to eddie bauer or gap or ralph lauren would really make my weekend......
