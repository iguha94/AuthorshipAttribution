         ok, so in the middle of a major catering job- in a tent in a field in the driving rain- my children disclosed that they both enjoy my blog but feel that the information provided is much too dangerous -like my name- and that the information that i share about them is much too personal. then came the ultimate insult- 'you know mom- your blog is almost as bad as grandma's christmas newsletter'    now that hurts.  my parents (and now just my mom) write this verbose christmas tome, with semi accurate information that is oh so personal to the point of liabel- my mother and i fell out for a time when she wrote about my miscarriage- and stated as fact that it would have been twins. the twins part was pure conjecture- and the inclusion of the miscarriage was quite upsetting. to this day i contend that their college friends from 1948-1952 did not need to know about my miscarriage.   therefore, i will compare each and every blog to a christmas newsletter from hell- and hopefully edit out any information that would similarly upset my children. of course, i really don't think that i have embarasses my children as much as could have been done........  anyway- back to the catering job- we in mud up to our shoetops, cold and exhausted. my sons helped put together the spinach salads, and the strawberry shortcakes. they chatted away during the entire process- it is so fulfilling for a mother, even the meanest mamma, to see her children having positive, fraternal interaction.  it was quite a special moment to see sons that used to be unable to be in the same room without the threat of physical violence to suddenly appear to enjoy the company and/or opinions of the other. .i might just cry remembering it.  merry christmas, boys......
