         ok, so this weekend mean mamma is recovering a chair.  this is the second time that this chair has had to be recovered- our precious cat mistakes this chair for a scratching tower. the first time, i paid someone $150 to do the job. the cat had the back in tatters within a year- so i decided to do the second recovering myself since it appeared to be a short-term thing anyway.  the fabric is a soft gold with a rib to it that i got for $1 a yard at the last jackson chair sale- even if i screw up i am out less than $10. i have learned a lot about the process since the last go-around- i took apart the cover, and used each piece as a pattern for the new cover. i also added an inch around each side- the last time it was hard to stretch the thing to cover the bottom of the chair..........i have moved the operation out to the back room because there is more floor space. my goal is to finish before the 6 hours of A&E's pride and predjudice finishes up on the vcr- my family finds my fascination with jane austin humerous. i like to watch such things while doing projects because i don't have to pay really close attention, but i can pay attention if i want to..... i would not attempt to watch say gosford park right now because i would be rewinding odften to figure out what is going on........and what was said.  besides, the more one reads, or watches P&P, the more astute one becomes to austin's satire on the uppety-side of this world. right now, i am struggling to get the parts over the armrests just right.........  if all goes well, i want to recover the loveseat in the front room- there is also an arm chair with a matching footrest that i will pay someone to to because it has lots of wood trim that i wouldn't know how to work around.  of course, i could have paid someone to do all of this, but i am trying to save money for a trip...... now, if only my on-site cat whisperer would tell the kitty to stop with the scratching........
