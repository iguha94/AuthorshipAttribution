         ok, so i was piqued by the letter to the editor section of the paper yesterday, both with the quasichristian letter (quasi because she is quite ill-informed about her church history and it is her duty as a christian to become informed.....)and for the letter about the alzheimer's patient arrested in savealot for eating a 50 cent candy bar. i shop at savealot for the restaurant for such sundries as oyster crackers and canned kidney beans.  it is close to the restaurant when we run out of homemade bread during lunch.  the manager is always very nice to me, as are some of the checkout clerks. however, there are also some checkout clerks who haven't got 'a lick of sense'. the store manager is off on thursdays- i can only hope that this incident happened on her day off, and that one of the nitwits was responsible. it is also possible that the store has a black and white policy on shoplifting- with no clause for mitigating circumstances like senility.  the idea of shopping there leaves a bad taste in my mouth- but i would hate to see that store close because it is the only grocery left in danville that is within walking distance to people like those who live in the apartment building next to trc, or walnut street apartments, etc.  i would not be surprised if savelot is boycotted by those who know this woman, or know of this incident.  either way, there will be no happy ending.
