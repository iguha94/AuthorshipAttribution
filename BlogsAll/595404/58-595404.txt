         ok, so some people do not understand (1) the concept of recycling (2) the reality that beer bottles, once the beer is consumed, are truly empty. at the wedding we catered yesterday, the groom bought ten or so cases of beer, and one bottle of white zinfandel (in case there was someone who didn't drink beer......) all but one case was consumed, and was presented to one of the groomsmen as the reception was clearing out.  he sat in the lobby waiting for a ride with another guy, and continued to drink fromt he fullbottles in the case while he waited.  at this point, i figured the place was empty enough to justify dragging all of the cases of empty bottles to our truck so that i could run them by the recycling center on my way home.  (i didn't want there to be 9 cases of beer bottles in the back of the truck if i had to drive it to church.....)  so when i was carrying the last case out through the lobby toward the truck, this wiseguy finally notices and says .....yerhhhhhhhh what are you doing with our beer.  i tried to explain that these were empties, but he insisted on looking in the case  just to be sure i wasn't going to be drinking any beer that he could drink himself.  what a jerk.......he really did say something that sounded like yerhhhhhhh- a slightly drunken yerhhhhhhh...........
