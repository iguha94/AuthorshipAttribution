         ok, so this morning on npr john feinstein commented on the plethora of major sporting events that took place this weekend- the tyson fight, the nba finals, the french open, the world cup, the stanley cup, the belmont/triple crown. of these mean mamma only watched the belmont stakes, of which coverage lasts 1 hour for a race that lasts only 2-3 minutes at most. i was disappointed that war emblem couldn't pull off a victory- racing and breeding in ky could have used that boost to ratings.    i was most disappointed that i wasn't able to watch either the men's or women's finals from french open. i have walked by the roland garros stade in paris- on the way to jardin bagatelle- and i am fascinated by the game.  of course, mean mamma has neither the talent nor the fitness, nor the eye-hand coordination to play the game, but she has always enjoyed watching others play the game. those williams sisters are astounding athletes- though i would have liked to see j. capriati win another grand slam event. i was on my way to frankfort while that match was being played, and i was at church while the men's final was played.    the other sporting events are either of no interest whatsoever (nab,stanley cup, tyson) or unaccessible (world cup) due to lack of cable tv. one of mamma's true meannesses is her determination to not have cable tv. she feels that having cable just encourages people to watch tv- lots of mindless television watching- and she doesn't feel that she needs to pay for such a mindless pursuit.  this week, she will celebrate 21 years of cable-free marriage, by the way.  those offspring who feel the need to watch cable programs, of course, can walk up the street to grandma's house, where satelite programming is available, and probably utilized 24/7.  yea,yea,yea, so i have never watched sex in the city, or 6 feet under, but i have read a lot of books lately.......
