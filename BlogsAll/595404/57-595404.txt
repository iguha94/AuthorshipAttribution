         ok, so andrew got a letter friday from uk explaining that he probably would not get any on-campus housing this semester, and suggested that he look off-campus for the time-being. he is on a waiting list, the length of which was not disclosed.  this afternoon we went up to lexington to look at an apartment kept by a friend who lives in danville (she needed a lexington address to keep her health insurance coverage.....). it is 6 miles from campus, which is better than the distance from danville if he were to commute from home.  she is willing to let him stay there short-term- until something turns up on campus after the first few weeks when people decide to chuck it all and go back home.   i would so rather move andrew into a dorm his first time away from home, and i have got to get used to the fact that he may have to live totally on his own from the get-go.  locking his own door, taking out his own garbage, buying his own groceries........i do believe that he can do all of these things, but i hate to see him miss the dorm thing.  i only stayed in a dorm 1 year before moving on to a series of roommates and a series of apartments- mostly run-down places near campus.  this place is almost too nice and pristine--i hope he takes very good care of it since it belongs to a good friend and i want to stay good friends with her.........
