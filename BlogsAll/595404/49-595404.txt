         ok,so i was mean last night at the block party we were invited to out on the newer part of bluegrass estates- the embattled part of bluegrass estates.....i inoocently asked the man eating next to me at the potluck pre-fireworks supper if this was the neighborhood that wanted to send it children to boyle instead of danville.  oh, yes, he said- it makes no sense to send our children to danville when we are right across the street from the boyle schools.  he added that he didn't sign the petition until 80% of his neighbors had also signed. and that his children were grandfathered in because they already attended boyle.  and that he was confident that boyle was the better district...not that anything was actually wrong with danville, but that his children were getting a fine education at boyle.  i mentioned that the dhs class of 2002 was sending 95% of its graduates to college/tech schools, and asked about boyle's track record.  he wasn't sure of actual numbers, but he was sure that the % had caught up to dhs in the past few years.  which means he knew that boyle traditionally has a poor % of children going to college- at the time we decided to send ours from montessori to danville, there was at least a 20% differential in the % going to college between the districts- a substantial difference.  the gentleman in question does plan to vote yes on the wet/dry issue, so he can't be all bad......  but enough of all that- i did enjoy the fireworks, and the international cuisine of the potluck- several familes are either from china or japan- so i enjoyed wonderful soy-basted salmon, sushi, and a delectable tofu/noodle/vegetable dish.  yum yum.
