  Ben asked if I like Cronenberg's   Naked Lunch .   The answer is a sort of tentative yes.  I haven't seen the movie since I was in high school, and my memory isn't that clear on it.  I recall responded to elements of it quite well, but not being able to fully submerge myself in the world.  That's a big problem for a Cronie movie, as his work is usually so well done as to be believable. (even when there are    VCR vaginas galore .)  I was also very young and naive, and it's possible that with a better understanding of Cronie I might like it more.  Or I might like it less.  I do know that William S. Burroughs is a terrible writer and that even contemplating turning such difficult, intentionally inacessible and mindless a novel as   Naked Lunch  into a film is a study in masochism.  I can see what Cronie would want to do the project, though, and can see the link in terms of aesthetics between the two artists.  But Cronenberg is way too good for Burroughs.  If I watch this again, any time soon, I will fashion a more detailed response.  In the mean time, just know that I feel your pain, Ben, even if I do think I liked the movie.  However --   M. Butterfly  is fucking awesome and I am disappointed that you stalled 20 minutes in.  Boo hiss.
