And why am I defending   The Day After Tomorrow  from    Tim's attacks?   Well, first of all, I'm really not.  The science is obviously seriously f'ed up and unbelievable.  The 10 degrees per second incident is retarded.  No one would survive that, burned Nietzsche text or no.  It was already way under zero degrees Farenheit, so by the time this little storm passed it would be, I don't know, absolute zero or something.  However, Tim, by the time they were standing hatless on the rooftop, the storm had ended.  The supercold air, which was sucked from the troposphere down by the funnel of the glacier-hurricane, would have dissipated quite quickly once the sunlight returned.  So, although they should have all been frozen instantaneously like those dudes in Scotland, that's beside the point.  If they miraculously survived, they could probably be around sans hat at the end, with minimal frostbite.  Tim does not mention the wolf fight, which is definitely the dumbest part of this movie.  Wolves and dorks alike would have been too frozen to do much fighting at this point.  Plus, CGI wolves aren't very scary to me.  The frickin' air was scarier, in fact.  How can it be that two people can agree, almost point for point, on the nature of a film and still disagree on whether or not it's good?  Tim and I obviously feel differently about this movie without really disagreeing about anything.  Well, the answer is emphasis.  I simply don't care how ridiculous it all is, while Tim apparently does.  And I refuse to take the director's politics seriously, since that's exactly what he wants us to do.  I've spent enough time ignoring Susan Sarandon whenever she opens her mouth to know that it's best to pretend celebrities have no politics, and just enjoy the show.
