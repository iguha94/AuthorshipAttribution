Ben claims that    Michelle Malkin  is the new    Ann Coulter .  Ben is a heretic and will perish at the stake.  1. Yes, Ms. Malkin is hot.  She definitely has the whole porn star thing going for her, with her hair all blowin' back in the wind and her mouth slightly open.  You can practically taste her pussy-juice already can't you?  She's maybe even hotter than Ann.  But who cares?  2. Ms. Malkin only seems to write on two topics.  One is immigration/terrorism -- the same thing in her mind-- (on which she basically steals her positions and her style of writing about them from Ann Coulter, only minus the jokes and the most egregious right wing craziness -- in short, she's shrill AND boring.)  The other is female sexuality and how it must be destroyed.  Even Ann doesn't go that far.  If you read Malkin's pieces of Courtney Love and Washingtonienne, the overwhelming sense is one of moral outrage that these women actually use their vaginas for something other than giving birth and having clitorectomies.  Oh, not that I'm defending Courtney Love, who is obnoxious and gratuitous and ugly to boot, but imagine what Ann Coulter would say about her and then compare it to Malkin's self-righteous bore-fest.  Now, I understand why Ben has a boner for her.  He hates immigrants and he loves to fetishize Asian women.  That is cool.  But to compare her (favorably) to the amazing source of wonder and beauty that is Ann Coulter will not be allowed to stand.  When you actually compare them, it is clear that Ann is the more rabid, mouth-frothing Right Winger and the one with a sense of humor.  And, may I add, where is Talking Michelle Malkin Doll?  That's right.  There isn't one.  So, you can eat Ann Coulter's hepatitis-free shit, Michelle Malkin!  Ain't no one gonna displace my Ann from her pedestal as Hot Right Wing Babe.
