I watched     Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen   last night.  This was honestly one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen.  Things, very strange things, just kept happening.  Lindsay Lohan's fantasy world was very freaky, and the "reality" was hardly less fucked up.  I just didn't know what was going on.  I don't even know how to rate such a movie.  Lurking underneath the flashy editing and special effects and bizarrely hilarious obsessions (card board cutouts of her favorite band, etc.) there lurks a truly terrible movie.  But as it was, I just don't know.  There were certainly a lot of laughs to be had, and Carol Kane was fucking amazing as usual.  Lindsay's tits were huge, as usual.  Lindsay herself was charming and somehow strangely believable, as usual.  Anyway, I could go on at length, but since I really can barely remember what happened to me during that hour and a half, I will simply pass on the two funniest lines.  "Lola" on needing permission to go to New York City alone: "In some cultures fifteen-year-olds are grandmothers.  Nobody gave the permsision for that, did they?"  And then, Lola on chasing her extremely shit-piss-drunk rock-star crush Stu (lead singer of the hilariously named band Sidarthur) through the alleys of New York (this is also the joke that the film's target audience is least likely to get, but I hope all of you do): "Except for all the garbage and cars, it's just like following Heatchliff out on the moors!"
