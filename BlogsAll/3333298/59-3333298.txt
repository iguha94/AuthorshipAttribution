  Scientist says space elevator could be up and running in 15 years.   The space elevator has become a staple of science fiction and now has serious backers within the US space program.  The elevator would be thinner than a piece of paper, and perhaps three feet wide, and capable of carrying loads of up to 13 tons.  A really cool space elevator would have to have a heavier payload, but this will do for now.  Why are space elevators not only cool, but more or less essential for a large-scale space program?  Because the elevator lifts its cargo out of Earth's gravity well, the fuel expended to transport goods between planets or other space-objects would be greatly reduced and the cost of such interplanetary trade would accordingly plummet.  I am critical of Bush's Mars plan -- in part because it doesn't seem to be part of a larger colonization scheme, and because of its enormous cost.  But the elevator, which would have a modest budget of around $10 billion, would have greater impact on the entire space program for little cost and could eventually make colonization a real possibility.  So build the fucking elevator already, NASA!  Do something useful for the first time in your damned existence and give us the key to space!  And once again allow us sci-fi-reading nerdy prognosticators the ecstatic joy that only comes from being right.  O, space elevator, how I do wax my pole to thee.
