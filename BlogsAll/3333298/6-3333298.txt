I'm sorry guys, I know that you are all probably tired of my fixation on Ms. Coulter.  You are probably also tired of reading about  The Passion of the Christ .  But I found two really great pieces by Ann about the movie that are worth a look.  You can find them    here  and    here .  I think she ultimately misses the point, which is that however good a religion by be, it's gun-toting practitioners rarely seem to get that message.  These two passages made me pee my pants (kind of):    With all the subtlety of a Mack truck, Safire called Gibson's movie a version of "the medieval 'passion play,' preserved in pre-Hitler Germany at Oberammergau, a source of the hatred of all Jews as 'Christ killers.'"  (Certainly every Aryan Nation skinhead murderer I've ever met was also a devoted theater buff and "passion play" aficionado.)   The "passion play" has been put on in Germany since at least 1633. I guess 1633 would be "pre-Hitler." In addition, Moses walked the Earth "pre-Hitler." The wheel was invented "pre-Hitler." People ate soup "pre-Hitler." Referring to the passion play as "pre-Hitler" is a slightly fancier version of every adolescent's favorite argument: You're like Hitler!    and:   In fact, Jesus' distinctive message was:   People are sinful and need to be redeemed, and this is your lucky day because I'm here to redeem you even though you don't deserve it, and I have to get the crap kicked out of me to do it.  That is the reason   He is called "Christ the Redeemer" rather than "Christ the Moron Driving Around in a Volvo With a 'Be Nice to People' Bumper Sticker on It."
