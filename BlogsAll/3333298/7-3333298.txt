I won't bother to make a counterargument to Ann Coulter's    slightly overblown attack on Arlen Specter .  It will surprise no one that I, a Democrat, support one of the most interesting moderate Republicans in the Senate.  (though calling Specter a "moderate" is misleading' his views, like those of most "moderates" aren't so much in the middle of the Left-Right spectrum as outside of it altogether, something that Ann Coulter and Michael Moore can agree to hating.)  Nor will it surprise anyone that I think it's a good thing that a reactionary zealot like Robert Bork is not on the Court (and thank Senators Kennedy and Specter every time the conservative Rehnquist Court hands down a decent decision).  I will even praise her comments in the column on gun control.  If a woman has a right to have an abortion after she is raped, why shouldn't she have the right to carry a weapon to stop the rape altogether?  The point of this is just that I want to share with you another great Coulter quote, in which she recklessly and snarkily both compares gay marriage to penis enlargement and implies that Senator Specter has a small dick:   Luckily for the country, Clarence Thomas was nominated to the Supreme Court a year before Specter was up for re-election. After supporting Thomas, Specter turned around and started bellyaching that Thomas was a "disappointment" â€“ presumably for Thomas' failure to ferret out any more "new" constitutional rights such as gay marriage or taxpayer-subsidized penis augmentation. Don't hope for any more election-year conversions if Specter is re-elected: The old coot will be 80 years old by the end of the term.
