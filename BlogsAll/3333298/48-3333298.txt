One's first posting on a new blog should, I suppose, be revelatory and witty.  Or at the least interesting.  This posting is none of those things.  It is my birthday and I've decided to start blogging at the hysterical insistence of my friend Ben who threatened to sign me up against my will if I didn't do it.  This blog is not intended to be a diary of my life.  I will never (or nearly so) write about my roommate's cat's vomit or my ingrown hairs or my scandalous crush of Pervez Musharraf.  Actually, I will talk about that last one, since he's an important figure in world affairs, and full disclosure is important.  So, the puking cat being out of the bag, I have a scandalous crush of Pervez Musharraf.  I wouldn't mind a bit if he resigned as President of Pakistan and became President of my Ass right now.  I have written him several letters on this subject, but to no avail.  If any of you have better contacts with various world-wide dictators, please pass them along.  The primary purpose of this blog is for me to write about politics and movies and whatever else I feel like writing about.  So please check-in frequently to see what I have to say.  Unless you hate what I have to say, in which case go read someone's angsty emo diary blog about cat barf and eye makeup.  That's all for now. I'm already tired of listening to myself.
