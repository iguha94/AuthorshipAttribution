  Dahlia Lithwick on O.J. :   The truth about O.J. is that for one brief moment, the law and the media went crazy and had a lot of sex, and gave birth to a vast sprawling beast that ate us all. With the trial over, life, law, and television returned us to our previously scheduled broadcast. It was all just a mistake, really. Let's keep it that way.  She's right of course.  The O.J. trial wasn't symptomatic of anything.  It was aberrant more than anything and reveals nothing about race, or jury-selection, or jury nullification, or domestic violence or legal ethics.  It exists in such a strange place in the intersection of so many American preoccupations (television, celebrity, crime, race, sex, violence, flashy lawyers) that its lessons can't be applied outward to any other case (with the possible exception of the upcoming Kobe trial, which mixes a nearly identical cocktail of issues.)  She's equally right that it's a little embarrassing to remember the intensity of emotion everyone seemed to feel.  I remember that the verdict came down during lunch, and spilled over in to regularly scheduled class time.  We had all abandoned the cafeteria or the outside to huddle together in our favorite teachers' classrooms to await the verdict.  And we went late to our next class and no one seemed to think this was inappropriate.  The fate of this man's life, a fate which effected none of us in the remotest way, had become the center of our existence.  What was wrong with us?
