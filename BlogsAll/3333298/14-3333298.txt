The Mayfield case is likely to raise a number of questions about civil liberties, as it certainly should.  But the questions that need to be raised most are not about PATRIOT Act, religious persecution or material witnesses.  The real villain in this story is fingerprinting.  Fingerprint evidence was created by law enforcement and is based on what amounts to an assumption: each of us has entirely unique and identifiable fingerprints.  This may be true in theory, but the differences are often so minute that multiple experts are almost always used to confirm the source.  When a print is difficult to read (smudged, partial, overlaid on other prints) it can be almost impossible to do an accurate match.  When fingerprints are being matched by photograph (as in Mayfield's case) room for error grows rapidly.  Despite the flaws in the system (   detailed in this  New Yorker  piece ) we continue to view fingerprints as unassailable.  A recent Washington Mutual Bank commercial features a "lying lawyer" saying to a jury "Are fingerprints really 'evidence?'  I don't think so," as the punchline to a joke.  This wholesale acceptance of an evidentiary tool as scientific (no one feels the same about eyewitness accounts, and DNA testing always features the 1 in 50 million appellation, implying a chance for error, as fingerprinting does not) is a serious danger to our justice system.  If Spanish authorities had not been conducting a separate investigation, Brandon Mayfield would almost certainly have gone to prison for a crime he did not commit, based only on fingerprint evidence.  It's high time that we make sure juries understand that they should not convict someone only on fingerprints and that we conduct serious scientific work on the method in general.
