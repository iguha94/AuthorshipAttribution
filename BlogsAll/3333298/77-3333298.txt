  Truth.com ads.   I mean, okay, I'm a smoker.  So maybe I'm biased.  But I really, really hate this shit.  In a recent ad a woman approaches a man and says "Do you have the time?" and he tells her and she says "Oh my God.  I hate to tell you this, but a bunch of people just died."  It's so manipulative.  I guess they think they are "shocking" people into not smoking, or perhaps that they are putting tobacco deaths into perspective.  Of course, the numbers they use are probably exaggerated.  Although tobacco certainly does kill, I'm not convinced that casual exposure to second-hand smoke is as dangerous as they claim, or that every case of heart disease or lung disease in smokers can be laid at tobacco's feet.  But even that's not the point.  THIS is the point: don't these little fuckers have anything better to do with their time?  They obviously have a great deal of activist energy.  It could be directed in all kinds of directions.  Racism, sexism, homophobia, fighting for workers rights, fighting for fair immigration laws, fighting against far more terrible polluters like SUVs or factories.  Instead, they dress up as rats and run around in subways and make idiots of themselves.  Drooling idiots.  It's totally embarrassing to watch or to hear this shit.  I mean, do you really find meaning in educating people about the dangers of cigarettes?  Do you really think that you matter?  No one cares about you (except maybe your tight ass and perky tits) so get the fuck off my TV and leave me in peace.  Oh yeah, and that ass of yours needs douched.  Now THAT'S the truth (dot com)  ps: please go check out their little website and count how many times they use the word "kooky."  Kooky.  Wow.  Kooky antics really make me realize that I'm killing myself slowly. The only words of sense on the whole thing are this bit from a concerned theTruth.com viewer: "you guys, pardon my french are stone cold morons."  Truth, yo, Truth.
