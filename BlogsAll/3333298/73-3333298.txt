Heaven annoys me.  Specifically it annoys me when people who should know better (i.e. Christian fundamentalists and Ann Coulter) talk about how so-and-so is "in Heaven."  Ronald Reagan is now "in Heaven," for instance.  Of course, he is not in Heaven.  Only God and the angels are in Heaven.  The bible is pretty clear on this.  Here are a few subtle clues as to the fate of man upon death:  "No man hath ascended up to heaven" (John 3:13).   "David is not ascended into the heavens" (Acts 2:34)  "The dead know not anything ... Their love, their hatred, and their envy is now perished" (Eccl. 9:5)  "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return" (Gen. 3:19).  "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them" (Heb. 11:13).   "The Son of Man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels: and then shall he reward every man according to his works" (Matt. 16:27)  This is a reference to the fact that when Jesus comes back he will rise us up out of our graves and judge us.  This is why when my grandfather died, my grandmother had to meet with the priest to determine if cremation was okay.  I mean, if you burn up Grampy's body, what is going to rise out of the grave during the Rapture?  These facts, which should be well-known and obvious to Christians who have studied their fucking text, can be found at this    website.   I'm getting tired of people pretending that their poor dead mother is in Heaven, when in fact she is rotting in the grave.  I happen to believe she's just rotting, but even if I were a Christian, at best I'd be able to say she's rotting and waiting in dreamless sleep for the Rapture.  It may be comforting to imagine a place on unimaginable bliss awaiting us, but in fact we can't get there until after Earth is destroyed by Armageddon.  No wonder Reagan was so eager for the End of Times.
