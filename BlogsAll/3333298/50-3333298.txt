Slate's got a nice little convo    hashing out the Bush campaign's "Hitler ad."   Will Saletan is far more serious than necessary (but if his Kerryism's section is an example of his sense of humor we shouldn't be surprised.)  Jacob Weisberg, on the other hand, is awesome.  Some nice bits of Weisberg:  But the vileness of "Kerry's Coalition of the Wild-eyed" must not be allowed to obscure its essential hilarity. What moron came up with this idea? What are they smoking in Karl Rove's office? C'mon, Will. This ad is the campaign equivalent of  The Producers —an idea so egregiously tasteless and stupid that it might just succeed as camp . . .I know I should be disgusted by the attempted association of Democrats and Nazis, but it's too funny to get upset about. Cue the goose-stepping mädchen of the Brookings Institution! . . its argument [is] that Nazism was basically a failure to relax . . ."This is not a time for pessimism and rage," the screen text says, over an image of a not at all enraged John Kerry telling his camel joke.  But then Weisberg does get serious, with a devastating dismissal of Bush's new campaign theme:  In the president's view, is there ever "a time" for such sentiments? Would Bush have counseled optimism if he'd been a Jew facing the real Hitler in Germany in the 1930s, or a Kurd in Saddam's Iraq? Should the kidnapped U.S. Marine threatened with beheading by his captors be optimistic because optimism is the American way?  Bravo, Mr. Weisberg.  Bush's campaign ads will go down in the history of political camp, I'm sure, along with the silly and overlong JFK ad featuring a ditty with the fast-sung refrain: "Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy!"  But the campy fun of Bush's bumbling rhetoric shouldn't mask its essential effectiveness, or the vileness that lurks just under it.
