Ben is mean to my boyfriend, Ben Stiller.  I can't really find a way to defend Ben though.  I mean, criticisms of him are usually accurate, with the exception of the morons who thinks he's ugly.  But, I have a bit of a monkey-man fetish.  I won't deny it.  Ben carries a link to    this discussion  of Stiller's career.  The funniest bit of this is Tara's response to Sarah questioning why Ben voices Thomas Jefferson in the (totally fantastic) PBS show   Liberty's Kids :   If you don’t picture a short, somewhat simian Jewish dude when you think of Thomas Jefferson, then I guess you’re not much of a patriot,  Sarah .  I think it is good of PBS to admit that Jews had a great deal of impact on our Founding.  If we finally admit that Thomas Jefferson was a tall, grey-eyed, red-headed Welsh Jew then we can finally admit that the Jews are responsible for slavery.  Solves a lot of problems, don't it?  Thanks, Ben Stiller!  ps: I haven't seen an episode of the show with Thomas Jefferson (though I have seen Benedict Arnold, Ethan Allen and, of course, Ben Franklin who is the sort of surrogate father of the Liberty's Kids, though I suspect he may be their real father as well) so I don't know the answer, but who else thinks nothing could be better than hearing Ben Stiller do a Virginia Gentry accent?
