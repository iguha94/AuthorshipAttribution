And, at long last, here is my entry in Ben's    little project.   As for the title of the column, I leave that to you literate readers to uncover.  1. Fake MS: I know this isn't probably what Ben had in mind, but my index finger is all twitchy and I totally think it's the beginning of a neurological disease.  2.    Rem Koolhaas  and, especially, the new    Seattle Public Library.   This kind of architecture gets me wet.  Stroll through the series, so you can see the ridiculously awesome escalators.  Mmmmmmmm.  3.   Against Interpretation : surprise!  I know.  I'm definitely obsessed with Sontag's brilliant early essays.  Her voice cuts through all the crap, seeking, and even finding, what she calls "an erotics of art" to replace literary hermeneutics.  4.    Louise Gluck , poet laureate of the United States, and especially this poem:  "Siren"  I became a criminal when I fell in love. Before that I was a waitress.   I didn't want to go to Chicago with you. I wanted to marry you, I wanted Your wife to suffer.  I wanted her life to be like a play In which all the parts are sad parts.  Does a good person Think this way? I deserve  Credit for my courage--  I sat in the dark on your front porch. Everything was clear to me: If your wife wouldn't let you go That proved she didn't love you. If she loved you Wouldn't she want you to be happy?  I think now If I felt less I would be A better person. I was A good waitress. I could carry eight drinks.  I used to tell you my dreams. Last night I saw a woman sitting in a dark bus-- In the dream, she's weeping, the bus she's on Is moving away. With one hand She's waving; the other strokes An egg carton full of babies.  The dream doesn't rescue the maiden.   5. Deschutes Brewery's    Obsidian Stout.   Mmmmmmmm.  Beer.
