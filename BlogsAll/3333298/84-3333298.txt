Having spent a good deal of the last few days savaging Mr. Eggers and his "movement," I think it's important to turn my roving eye on his critics.  Please go read the nonsensical proto-Communist ravings of the    Underground Literary Alliance.   The Manifesto reads like something Ted Kaczynski might have written had he gotten tired of environmentalism and moved on to literature.  Oh, they have some good points.  But they speak incessantly of the "professionalization of writing."  They act as if successful writers of the past were not professionals with the luxury to write instead of work at real jobs.  They also wage yet another attack (as does Dale Peck and so many other critics of contemporary literature) against "style" which they see as inferior to "content."  In fact, much of what they write, about living among "real people" and about the glories of poverty, seems to be a manifesto in favor of a specific style: namely Socialist Realism.  They pose as injured geniuses harmed by the stifling influence of Franzen, Eggers and Moody, defeated by the "credentials" system of good writing, when their actual manifesto declares openly that they seek to Stalinize writing.  Art must serve the people, they declare, and forget that art has no such duty and that nearly all art that does is bad. And of course, it all comes down to money.  The ULA writers didn't get Guggenheim Fellowships to write their shitty zines, therefore the literary establishment is "corrupt to the core."  My, this self-righteous indignation sure does keep us warm at night, doesn't it?  This is another problem lit crit must face.  When our choices are between smug, self-serving idiotic prose and brutal, uninspired, authoritarian prose we have reached a pretty pass.  So, that being said, I guess I should shut up and write a novel.  Then I'll show Eggers and the ULA both who deserves to punch whose nuts the hardest.
