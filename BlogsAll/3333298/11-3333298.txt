I know I promised that Fagistan would not be a diary of my life.  For one thing, my life is so much more boring than, say,    Washingtonienne's .  The only interesting things I do or think about are posted here as, you know, essays.  I also promised never to write about work (I did not promise this to you, but to myself, as it only makes good sense) --  But tonight something occurred as work that I feel obligated to share.  I went outside for a breath of fresh air and to look around the property to see if anything ill was going down, only to find two people crouched in the middle of the road, intermitantly weeping and whispering to one another.  Obviously they were a couple having some kind of fight and/or break-up scene.  It was really embarrassing for me, as I didn't notice them until I was almost stepping on them and then had to give them an embarrassed "Oh, excuse me" and turn heel and run.  Is the middle of a traffic-bearing street really the best place to be huddled up, nearly invisible, in the midst of a sense-depriving fight?  (they did not notice me either, and barely paused when I spoke to them.)  People need to learn some important skills, like not making public spectacles of themselves or endangering their own lives for the sake of writing more drama on their LiveJournals.  This doesn't quite rank with the best incident I had, which was when a suspicious car was parked in the driveway for a long time and I went to check it out only to find a guest giving a man a hand job.  Had I been the man, I'd definitely be blogging about my life instead of this politics and culture crap.
