Dahlia Lithwick pens a great article in which she tries to discern how far the    slippery slope  of gay marriage can go, with plenty of nifty links to other writers on the subject.  She touches on some of the ground I covered here in    Why Gay Marriage Doesn't Matter , but with a different emphasis.  She is certainly more pro-marriage than I am, and less willing to admit the flaws in the system of monogamous marriage rights and the even bigger, gaping axe-wound of a flaw that is the system of civil marriage in general.  Another interesting article to read is    this more-than-slightly confused piece  in whch the author argues both that banning gay marriage may be bad policy and that we need the Federal Marriage Amendment.  That's not the interesting part, the interesting part is his description of how marriage might work as a system of contracts (a way to avoid the current marriage system altogether, in effect -- though the process could be cleaned up into a neater form if civil marriage were abolished).  Be prepared for some astoundingly convoluted logic in the piece (which also deals with abortion), such as the fact that Roe v. Wade not only "creates the right to abortion" (which it does not, by the way) but also grants "adult men increased power to cover up the fact (via legal means) that they are having illegal sex with a minor."  You know that abortion rights opponents are reaching hard when they come up with mind-bending logic like this.  There is only one good, and only one necessary, argument against abortion: it kills babies.  That's about as bad as it gets right?  "Well, I wasn't quite sure I wanted to ban infanticide, but I'm certain I don't want men to get away with statutory rape!"   Clarification : Of course abortion is not infanticide, but this post was about gay marriage, remember?
