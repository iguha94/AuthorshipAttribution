The President must really miss good old Ari.  Scott McClellan is    way too easily badgered into submission by the White House Press Corps .  And, worse yet, he has a tendency to reveal portions of Bush's plan for America that I'm sure are meant to be kept secret.  The fact that this transcript (which I cribbed from    Tim ) is the first to include the remarks which come before McClellan tries to claim that members of the Bush campaign staff, who happen to be his drink-crazy daughters, are off-limits to questions (and Ms. Thomas makes him her bitch), might make it indicative of an even wider conspiracy.  (Please note: I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist myself, and think that probably McClellan is just a terrible press flack who needs to watch more of the West Wing for pointers from CJ Cregg, still it's creepy as fuck):   WND: Of course. But he would never allow the FCC to take action against any of us in talk radio for our political opinions, would he?   McCLELLAN: In a general sense, no. But, again, you phrase that in a context of some standards that apparently violated some of the Â our standards of decency.   So, the President will respect the First Amendment in a "general sense?"  He won't let the FCC drive his political opponents off the air in a "general sense"?  Of course, Bush is not alone here.  A while ago I remarked on a Salon article in which the author clearly compared Limbaugh's political views to Stern's obscenity (and advocated Limbaugh's removal from Armed Forces Radio as a result.)  The First Amendment is the one that both liberals and conservatives choose to treat in a "general sense" in the process of advancing their causes, and the one that is most vital to sustained democracy.  If there is any amendment that should not be treated "generally" it is Amendment I.  Of course, earlier in the transcript the reporter makes it clear that he, at least, isn't all that troubled by the persecution of Howard Stern, only by its implications for the political press.  This is a bit troubling too, although before anyone gets their panties in a twist, it's important that our legal system does make a strong distinction between political speech (which is always protected, however despicable) and non-political speech (which is, I suppose, "generally" protected, but with reasonable restrictions).  The real problem comes when the "obscene" and the "political" merge -- Stern can be political, although mostly he's just another asshole who thinks he's funny.  Can the obscenity rule be used to drive off political voices?  Obviously it can, and it's important to watch out for obscene right-wingers in order to compare the FCC's tactics in various cases.  Still, for pragmatic purposes, accepting the FCC's regulation of the broadcast system (which is, from a legal point of view, publicly owned) is necessary.  Does that mean the standards shouldn't change?  Of course not.  The standards are practically barbaric (I'm surprised we can say "pregnant" on air with the way Michael Powell's feverish little rat brain works).  I just see no problem with FCC regulation overall.  In a "general sense."
