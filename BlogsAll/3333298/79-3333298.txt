For those who are perhaps unaware of the significance of June 16, it is the day in 1904 on which Joyce's   Ulysses  takes place, and is thus named for his character, Leopold Bloom.  (It could, I suppose, just as accurately be called Dedalusday, after the other character, and Joyce's more frequent stand-in, Stephen Dedalus.  But that name is dumb.)     Joyceheads go crazy  worldwide, but especially in Dublin.  I'm not sure why they love him so much in Dublin, since he hated Ireland.  "How sick, sick, sick I am of Dublin! It is the city of failure, of rancor and of unhappiness. I long to be out of it."  Anyway, I've not yet managed to actually read the entire length of the "greatest novel ever" as it is often called.  Still, today allows us to reflect on literature, and on Modernism in particular.  Since we went through this all last week (though mostly relating to films, which bear almost no resemblance to novels) I am not particularly eager to get back into it.  That being said, Slate promises an interesting    e-mail exchange  between novelists Jim Lewis and Jeffrey Eugenides.  So far there is only Lewis's first entry, and I won't comment on it except to say that I was pleased when he proposes a ban on the use of footnotes in literature, and displeased when he makes no reference to William Faulkner, who was America's first Modernist, and who puts the form to its best use.  Oh well.  I suppose if I had my way critics would ONLY talk about Faulkner, and only to lavish him with praise.
