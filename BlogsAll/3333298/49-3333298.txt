1. Pink Eye photos like this one:         see also    this link  and    and this one too   2. The Supreme Court: I wrote about them below. Now today they say the Child Online Protection Act is probably unconstitutional and order a new trial!  Bravo!  3. Justice Clarence Thomas: He gets a special shout-out for being the greatest justice in the history of justices ever, anywhere.  Why?  He is a knee-jerk reactionary on every issue.  He is the only member of the Court who will support the President's detain-for-no-reason policies.  He hates abortion.  He hates gay rights.  He hates   Miranda .  But damn does he love porno!  Whenever a porn-related 1st Amendment case is before the Court, Thomas is pro-porn.  He can put his pubes on   my  Coke cans any day.  4.    Real Ultimate Power!   An older favorite, but nothing beats this ninja homepage.  "Ninjas are sooooooooooo sweet that I want to crap my pants.  I can't believe it sometimes, but I feel it inside my heart.  These guys are totally awesome and that's a fact.  Ninjas are fast, smooth, cool, strong, powerful, and sweet.  I can't wait to start yoga next year.  I love ninjas with all of my body (including my pee pee)."  5.    Jesus Is Hitler!   I just found this site and it makes me happy.  Go enjoy reading about Hitler/Jesus punching babies.
