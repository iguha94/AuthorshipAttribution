Last night  SNL  aired a "Best of Christopher Walken" episode.  Two observations:  1. During such retrspectives they should edit out the portion of the opening monologue where the host announces the night's musical guest.  This only leads to disappointment on the part of fans of said guest.  This rule should especially be followed when we are discussing    my husband's band.   2. Christopher Walken is not funny.  What happened?  I totally thought he was.  When I think back on his appearances on the show, I always do so with a smile.  But in watching a retrospective of what is supposed to be his "best" work, I was shocked to find that almost none of the scenes were funny!  Some of it was surely not his fault (Southerners pronouncing Colonel Angus as "kunnel angus" is only funny once or twice, not 80 times in 3 minutes, and any scene with chris parnell in it is bound to suck major hardcore baboon ass) but still.  It was excruciating.  Which makes me wonder: are other classic performances on  SNL  as bad as I don't remember them being?  I think specifically of the genius that was Steve Forbes, or the wonder of John McCain, but also of the less kitschy and more important turning point in my decison to like Gwynneth Paltrow, which was her appearance on this very show.  Oh, comedy, why hast though forsaken me?
