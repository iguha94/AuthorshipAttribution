Two fags just tried to check into the hotel, but ended up not staying.  As they were filling out forms one of them said to me, "Oh my God, where do you get your nails done?" I was horrified.  Where do I get my   nails done?   How fucking gay is that?  I pride myself on being typically un-gay in my rejection of exfoliation, moisturizer, manicures, pedicures, tight pants and shiny shirts.  Now some queen just waltzes right up and declares that he just   must  know where I get my manicure?  I wasn't even aware that I had great nails.  I chew them, for one thing.  Apparently I chew them really well or something.  I told the fag this and he said "Oh, you chew them?  They look so great!  Do you take clients?"  This was hysterical, of course, for so many reasons.  Can you imagine me getting paid, let's say, 75 dollars an hour, to chew on fags' fingernails?  It could be a new sensation!  Move over   Queer Eye For the Straight Guy , I've got some nail-munchin' to do!  It reminded me of an episode of Jerry Springer where one woman said her husband was very controlling and always made her chew his finger and toenails.  They then showed convenient back-stage footage of her chewing his toenails as she cried.  It was possibly the greatest thing I'd ever seen in my life.  And to think I could soon be doing it professionally!  My new personal ad will read: "Tall, heavyset GWM, shaved head, goattee, GREAT NAILS (all natural chew-manicure), seeking anyone who will let me stick my pee-pee in their poo-poo.  No walks on beach, no condoms."  Thank you God.  For making me gay and giving me great nails.  You are too good to me.
