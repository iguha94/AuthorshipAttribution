The Fagistan Comments pages are lighting up with good shit.  Here's a rundown.  1.    Pierluigi raises some very important questions  in his comments on the space elevator.  I'm not sure if NASA is working on the farting-in-space problem, but I do know this comment was so funny I crapped my pants.  Good thing I wasn't weightless.  2.    Jessica writes things, then erases them, then lies about it .  But what is most important is that she finally admits she is just dating Tom to get to me.  She points out a few problems to our potential union.  I will take care of them in short order.  a) okay, so she's dating my great friend Tom.  He has hair cancer.  He'll be dead in four months.  b) I'm married to her sister.  This marriage is null and void.  Firstly, I was already married to Rivers Cuomo at the time.  Secondly, Michigan does not recognize gay marriages.  Thirdly, in 13 months we have no yet consummated it.  c) I am gay.  This would be true, except for the fact that (as my former roommate Julian liked to point out) I only   pretend  to be gay to get chicks.  3.    Fagistan goes international!   I get my first post from someone I have never heard of, and she's a sexy Argentine to boot!  I can't read her blog though, since I'm a monolingual American idiot.  Still, she does want me to teach her how to chew fingernails.  Sexy.
