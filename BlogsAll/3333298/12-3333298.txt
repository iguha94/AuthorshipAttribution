Slate's Dahlia Lithwick    writes about Sandra Day O'Connor  and carries a link to    an older Slate piece  on her.  Despite my (far more occassional than one would think) disagreements with Justice O'Connor, she is a judicial hero of mine.  Not only for her trailblazing efforts as both judge and politician, but because at some point I realized that the partisan division of the Court is bad for justice.  That the political appointment, and political Senate confirmations, of judges has poisoned the well of law in this nation.  What strikes me most about O'Connor is not that she is a "moderate" (she very often is not -- except on issues like abortion, where she seeks to build a rational balance rooted in law) but that her decisions are eclectic and clearly driven by a forceful reading of US Constitutional Law.  Anthony Kennedy is a moderate.  Sandra Day O'Connor is a Justice who has managed to transcend politics in favor of legal interpretation.  These articles do a good deal to show her for what she is, and not what liberals so often think of her as (the fifth justice in the 5-4 Florida decision, for instance.)  And, speaking of Florida, don't try to throw that in my face.  The recount began because judges said it should, why shouldn't judges say it should stop? Properly speaking, the Supreme Court (although using tortured logic) restored vote counting to its proper sphere -- the political.  Furthermore, I may be alone among Democrats who are brave enough to admit that no amount of recounting would have delivered Florida to Gore.  Whether or not he won (he probably did) in theory, matters little since the voting machine errors were insurmountable at the counting table.  The only fair outcome was the Bush win, as messy as the whole matter was.  I can't really fault the Court for acting the way it did -- and matching the Florida Supreme Court's partisan thunder with some of its own.
