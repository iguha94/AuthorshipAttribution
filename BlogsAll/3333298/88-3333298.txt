  Ben finally gives Liz Phair some love.   I've liked her new album since it came out.  Not only am I not ashamed of it, but I think that people who have dismissed it as an excercise in commercialism should be ashamed of not being able to listen to a fucking record and shut their dirty mouths.  Sure, it's not   Exile  . . . but what the fuck is?  Imagine if we made that album the standard by which all others that came after were to be judged.  How many would pass muster?  Maybe two or three.  Maybe.  What it is, is a brilliant subversion of the pop form by Liz's distinctive sensibility.  She doesn't have a strong enough voice to carry off a full-blown pop sensation, and the tension of her slightly strained voice laid on top of happy nice pop sounds is brilliant and far darker than she's given credit for.  Sure there's a lot of throw-away stuff here, but there's also the old cynic at work.  "It's sweet how you believe you're in love with me . . ."  "Your record collection don't exist/You don't even know who Liz Phair is."  There is also a good deal of fun here.  Liz has always been funny, and many of these songs lack the darker undercurrents that made the previous albums so great, but it's still there.  She having fun being a woman in her 30s with a kid who still has great sex.  "I wanna play X-Box on your floor . . . " and of course, the rollicking and infectious "Hot White Cum" which both embraces and makes fun of her potty-mouth reputation, and is the sweetest pop song on the whole disc.  The difference between Liz Phair and Avril Lavigne is that Liz is able to take the material that others are writing and turn it around into something that is distinctive and clearly of a piece with her entire body of work, while passing it off as "pop rock" and letting "Why Can't I" and "Extraordinary" have their little day in the Top 40 sun.
