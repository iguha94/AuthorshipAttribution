The King of Peace, Sun Myung Moon, has offered us some    insight into how one should go about consummating one's marriage.   After some prayer, you must throw salt on the floor.  Since Satan has high blood pressure, this will keep him out.  Then you must make sure that there is a photo of the Reverend in the room, so that he can watch.  If possible, it would be preferable to have him behind a moose head, talking to you like Truman Capote in   Murder by Death .  The woman must take the initiative throughout the first two days, as she is in the position of "Mother of the Messiah" and the man is an archangel who is reborn as sinless Adam (in the formation stage -- I guess it's kinda Freudian or something.)  On the second day the same ritual is repeated, except that the man now enters the "growth stage" of Adam.  On the third day the man must "restore dominion."  This means he now gets to be on top.  Specific instruction is given to the wife that she should "respond to and cooperate with the man."  This is good instruction, as otherwise she'd be likely to lay there like a   Real Doll.   There are some further "notes."  This one is for Jamie Lee Curtis: "The act of love should be a complete act (penetration and ejaculation). In the event that it is difficult to achieve this, strive to achieve as much penetration as possible and continue with the remainder of the ceremony."  This is for ladies who marry a faggot by accident: "If insertion is not possible because the husband does not have an erection, the wife must take her husband's sexual organ in her hand and guide it into her sexual part in order to successfully do the ceremony."  Don't worry, it's not ALL robotic: "For the act of love, it is all right to caress each other."  A big thanks to the Salon Archives for    providing the link.
