         Hey there cyber land...hope all of you are making it with this nasty ass worm going round.  Well I have made it so far. I am behind a firewall and I have patched my systems long ago. So all in all I am pretty safe from that...however I am not safe from simple old hardware problems!  The main drive on my system decided that it wanted to drop the boot sector as well as the NTFS tables leaving my hard drive as a big lump of nothing just hanging out in my syste...in other words my computer took a big ole shit.  Fortunately I am well prepared for things like this and I am not phased when this kind of stuff happens. I have all my disks just layin around and I am in the process of repairing it now...but I will kinda be down on my main box for the time being.   What makes me maddest of all is that I had a lot of stuff saved on that hard drive and not all of it was backed up. Fortunately not much was really lost overall...just really my emails that I had recieved and my documtents...as well as my favorites...outside of that I didn't loose much and whatever is gone I can live without really.   Oh well...such is life.  Yesterday was bad, today was worse, and tomorrow it will get even more evil.  Peace
