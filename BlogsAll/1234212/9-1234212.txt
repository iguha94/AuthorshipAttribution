         wow two days in a row...  last night after ranting about voting rights and gun rights as a felon I found some interesting information  I will be allowed to vote once I have finished probation/parole/whatever...only seven states take away the right permanantly....thank blue glowy orb I live in one of the others that you get the right back....so at least I will be able to vote again  As for the right to buy and own a weapon that issue is a little cloudy. The ATF has the authority to restore that right on a case by case basis...however the congress has tried to stop that and the Supreme Court has said that the congress can't do that...but there is no real clear way yet for me to own a weapon after this crap is all done with.  Also I can get a passport...as the INS and various agencies that administer that program review on a case by case basis as to whether or not to give out passports to felons...so I will more than likely be able to travel one day...  Basically I will recieve most of my rights back...except that I will have a mark on my record and it will hinder me from getting security clearances...but that can be dealt with as well.  So all in all last night I found out good news...but still I want to own a gun...I have owned guns for some time now...and have been an avid weapons person...as I know a lot about them and love to go to the shooting range and kill imaginary bad guys...  Ahh well that fight will be later in the life...when all is said and done.
