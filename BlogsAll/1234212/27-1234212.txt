         Well I haven't yet rewritten my literary work of art yet...maybe later tonight I will concentrate and try to write it.  Not to much has been happening around here.   My sister did finally get up here. She brought with her new toys for me to play with. A Sony Camera (very swanky indeed) and a PocketPC by Viewsonic. She needs some apps for the PocketPC so I downloaded a shitload of development apps for it. Overall the downloads totaled around 500megs from Microsoft (they are all free development apps surprisingly enough). The only thing that I wasn't able to download was Visual Studio .NET which I already have the Architect Edition...so I am in the butter zone so to speak. Now I just have to sit down and do a little coding and try to get what she needs up and running.  The apps are basic calculators for Vet Medicine. One is for figuring out dosages for animals based on weight and the other is a subset, dosage dilluted into another substance by weight. They are all in the microgram level...so that will be interesting to get all the calculations written down then coded. I am looking forward to it because really when it comes to programming a calculator is probably one of the easiest things to figure out...the only difficult part will be GUI as I have never done any GUI programming...everything I have done was text based. So it will be a learning experience to say the least but I am looking forward to coding it out.   Plus it will give me some coding experience on PocketPC's which are fast becoming the standard for handheld devices. If I get semi-good at doing it on PocketPC then I will learn about PalmOS programming...which is a little different and with much different programming apps.  Well I am off to dinner...something down there must be for me to eat...must eat I am...
