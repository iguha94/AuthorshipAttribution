         Ok so I cleaned my room yet again and fixed it up a little better...I will post a pic tomorrow of it as my camera is downstairs right now and I don't want to go get it...did I mention that I am lazy?  Well not much to tell. I ordered a twenty dollar part for my computer...it was five bucks to ship it...jeesh...but I need that part badly  What else...I dunno.  Jess will be coming in this week for me to build his computer so that will be kewlio...I will get at least one visitor while I am on house arrest...plus he makes me laugh on the inside...hahaha  I am also planning to get a day while he is here to go out and at least grab lunch with him...have to run it by my officer but I don't think he will mind awfully much as he wants me to get out more often so I don't go berserk...he is a nice guy.  Well I am going to watch the rest of A Guy Thing and then I am getting some sleep.  Oh yeah did anyone see the new Man Show last night...Rogaine Blows donkey balls...he just isn't funny at all. Stanhope shows hope as he is just as funny as Adam and Jimmy...Rogan had a game show spoof of identify the ass crack or something like that. The funny thing about that is it shows just how much of a tool he really is. He is nothing but a brownose little bastard with bad hair. He really had to kiss ass to get this job.  Also did anyone see tonights Daily Show with John Stewart...well he is funny as hell and I think that show is probably one of the finest pieces of television programming anyone ever conceved. I am just so glad they are there to make fun of it all because if they weren't then the news would be soooo depressing.  Peace
