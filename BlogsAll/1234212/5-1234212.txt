         today I got out of the house for an hour...it was so nice.  My brain is gew, my guts are smart, my ass is hairy...my penis needs lovin  I want to be an angry comedian...my mom says that I have a very angry informed comedy about politics...that my sense of humor is very strange and without any moral or politically correct compass...and that the voices in my head really are only meant to be heard by me.  You see I get pictures in my head...now you say "everyone gets pictures in their heads"....well I think mine are a tad different. I dream in colour. I daydream all the time. I can have an entire seven year relationship with a banana in five seconds...the things that are funny to me are funny. I love humor that makes fun of people and disabilities. There is nothing funnier to me that a person with some twitchy disease like Timmy on Southpark belting out the National Anthem on a computer and me envisioning the batteries going dead and the machine kinda dying off...I find that hilarious...  I have a disability...no I'm not retarded...although I think retards are funny. I have no problems with people making fun of the fact that I am a gimp...  Sometimes I do feel bad about my sense of humor because I do realize that some people couldn't take it...but at the same time I feel that their is nothing sacred in this forsaken world...so make fun of everything and everyone...  If you can't laugh then you can't live...and lets face it...some shit is just funny
