         Today was a busy beaver day.  Lets see...first after I got up I made myself three scrambled eggs...now the only way to make scrambled eggs is with milk mixed in...so I did that and they were great.  After that I did a couple of breathing treatments and spanked the monkey.  Then I went out. I went and got some dog chews for Rufus as well as a dog tag with his name and my number on it...and I got him doggy breath fresheners...cause he has stank nasty breath. Maybe it is from him licking his twig and berry (he has only one dropped ball)...or maybe his ass...but it stinks, his breath I mean.  I also got my snake a mouse to eat and fed it to him...that is always kewl to see...my snake eating another living critter.  I got my hair cut...it is a little shorter than I asked for...but hey hair grows...and before long I will look like a shaggy dog again.  Also I had the oil in my car changed...that was needed badly seeing as it was way way overdue....  Not much else happened today...  Oh my grandma and I watched the Red Dragon...the Prequil to Silence of The Lambs...well I have now seen all three movies and have been totally unimpressed with all of them...ok Silence was creepy...the other one was gross (where they ate the brain soup)...and Red Dragon had only one saving grace and that was Edward Norton...and even with him in...the damn thing was just plain boring.  Well I am off to bed now...I have a meeting at 1:30 this afternoon...and I don't want to be to shot for it...so I must sleep some....  Peace ya'll  This me tryin to cyber...well not really me...but close enough   Cybersex h0n3z Style
