         Well Jesse got home and then his computer started acting up again....little fucker. Mostly it was stuff that I had installed but now didn't want to work. Great...so I logged in over the network and looked at it.  Seems the video card is acting up...it is sending distorted information out...and I saw it. I think the card just doesn't like it in there and when he gets his new card it will be fixed.  The Processor is registering funny...it is running a 2.4GHz but registering as something else...great...  Also he can't find his original driver disk for his Audigy 2 Platinum card and you can't just download the drivers off of Creative's Website (which is strange in itself)...this is just all fubar...I have never had this much trouble with a system...plus I can't just sit in front of it and monkey with it till it works...it is a couple hundred miles from here.  I should hopefully be able to figure it all out...given a little time...but this is just frustrating because again I have never had so much trouble...with the exception of my mom's pc.  What else...well I painted my CD-Burner and DVD Drive to match my case and external drive case...now it all matches up nicely. That went pretty easily once I figured out how to get the right texture to match.  Well I am tired and I think I am going to get some rest. I am searching for solutions to the problems posed above...hopefully I will find them easily.  Peace out...and never fear I am still a computer guru...I just need time to figure out the problem.
