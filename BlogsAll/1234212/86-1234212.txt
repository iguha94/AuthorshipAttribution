         I am tired and I still have to go get my mom in a couple of hours from the airport...I am tired...hey can I say that again I am tired.  Today was yet another day in corporate consumerism hell...the mall is possibly one of the worst places to work. The "twinkie" factor was really out today.  For those of you who don't know what a twinkie is. Here is the definition. Twinkie: Noun, pronoun: 1. A tasty sugar flavored and cream filled snack cake made by Hostess. 2. A derogitive description of the female of the species that looks like everyone else i.e. dressed alike with same cell phone attached to ear. Usage. Wow! That twinkie tastes good. or Wow! Look at all the twinkies walking by...I think I just got diabetes...please god kill me now.  Yes a twinkie in this context is the way girls dress at the moment...about a year and a half ago or two years ago black sorostitute slut pants were all the rage...in and of themselves they don't make you a twinkie...but if you are blond and in a pack and all have similar shirts on....then those are twinkies. Now it is Abercrouchy and Scratch...almost like scratch and sniff.  The only delight of my day is lunch in which I put my headphones on and escape into a realm of music (not the continuous loop crap they run at AF which we are across from) head upstairs and grab a slice of pizza or some other tasty morsal of mall food.  I must rest before I head out to the airport...so I will probably not update again tonight unless something comes up.   Till tomorrow...rage against the machine, throw a monkey wrench into the works, and break it all down. Because until we build a new one we will be stuck with this outdated piece of shit we call "the system". Funny in a culture that loves to aquire new shit all the time we haven't gotten a new system.
