         I was up for a few hours really just to do treatments and put food in my body and now I am off to bed again as tomorrow I have to work. It will be good to get out of the house tomorrow for a bit. It will give me a break.  I got to talk to Jonelle the other day as she was able to catch me while I had my phone on and on me...so we talked for a bit and she is coming out in December for Christmas and we plan to meet up then and have a good time...and my sister may be here as well so she can give me an outside opinion as to what she thinks of Jonelle.  I would seriously date Jonelle if she we here or I were there (in Callifornia where she is)..but that isn't happening right now. I am planning to go out that way once I get a lot of my crap out of the way and maybe get a little healthier. I have cousins out there that I have never really seen since they we were all tots so I could see them and then see Jonelle as well. While I would be out there hey I can put in my Resume' out there and see if I get any nibbles. You never know.  Well I am going to get back to bed...my sleepytime meds are kicking in and the screen is getting blurry...  Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect to all.
