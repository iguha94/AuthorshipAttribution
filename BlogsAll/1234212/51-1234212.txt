         I finally got all of the boxes working right. We have to send back Jesse's Nvidia 5900 Ultra 256MB card because it draws to much power from the XPC power supply. We are going to change it to a 5600...it will be almost as fast.  Had to format his drives and get everything to play nice...then I worked on his old computer which he is giving to his dad. All in all I have spent way to much time in front of different computer screens over the past 48 hours...but getting it working was well worth the time and energy. There is nothing like completing a project.   He built up a nice box...here are the specs. Shuttle XPC Base 2.4GHz P4 at 2.52GHz 1 Gig o' fast ass RAM 2 * 200GB Hard drives Sound Blaster Audigy 2 EX (live drive couldn't fit but the card works) Nvidia GF 4200 64mb RAM to be upgraded to a 5600 128MB RAM when it comes in.  Overall it is a fast ass machine. Plus it looks good to. The clear panel on it kinda glows with the power LED (which is blue)...it is badass! I will try and get a pic of it tomorrow if I remember and post it.  Got to get out today...that was kewl. Spent two hours with Jesse just bullshitting and doing things...plus had a Primanti Brothers sandwich...that was good (note to self look up spelling of sandwich just in case).  Tomorrow have a dude coming to look at some of these mini-helmets we have...hopefully he will take some of them off our hands. We sure as hell don't need them. From those funds I would build my mom a system similar to mine...cause her box is dead.  Well I am sick and tired so I am going to crash for a bit.  Love to all out there in Cyber Land.  Peace
