         Corrections to a past post...Bush will raise in excess of a quater of a billion dollars...that is a shitload of money, and we saw last time that he was able to buy the presidency with nearly that same amount.  Also I would like for some people to consider this. What if Dean gets the nomination nod from the Dems. Which I think he will. Who would be a great VP running mate?  After about two minutes of thought I came to this simple conclusion. I think that if he wins the primary he should give good ole Sen. McCain a call and have him sign up. Now for it to work he would have to keep his party affiliation.   Think about it...Dean if he won the primary would get most of the Democratic vote in the election. If he has McCain he could then garner the support of us Republicans that are disgusted with out party and current Administration but wouldn't normally vote for a Democrat (even though I will regardless of the running mate he chooses). Also McCain could bring in the support from the Independants that he held many of until he lost the primary in 2000. He could better bring in those Nader supporters and independants easier than just a fully Democratic ticket.  It may well be "the perfect political storm" for Bush and Cheney. As far as I know there isn't a law that says you can't pick a running mate from another party. The only thing would be is that both parties would be upset because of the choice....but it may be what the people want. Two fiscal conservatives both running on the platform that they will do what is in the best interest of the people, not what may be in the best interest of Washington and the Lobbyists.  Now that is a ticket that many could get behind and support I think. What do you think? Gimme a   Shout out!
