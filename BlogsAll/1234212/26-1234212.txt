         Well the pills last night finally did kick in...and when they did they made me sooo dizzy that I thought I was gonna throw up hard...I didn't...instead my lung started to bleed a lot...and looking at that maybe it was the slight blood loss that made me really dizzy (my blood count is always low as I leak like a siv).  Today the US Probation office came and put my leash on. The guy is really nice and I am thinking of cronicleing the next six months...maybe he won't mind if I mention his name. However I have to run that by him to see if he cares...plus obviously it would be transparent...if I talk shit then he would most certainly know. But again he is really nice and laid out a few ground rules...plus he told me that I am not gonna be a hermit cause he will be somewhat flexible as long as I be straight with him...and I do plan to be straight up with them all...cause I ain't gonna lie I don't wanna revoke this and have my ass end up in jail.  Well I dunno what now...maybe I will find some amusing shit to get myself into on the internet over the next few months...I have a lot of time and some energy to get rid of...plus in the next month or so I will be really starting to get my Ebay thing going...I have a lot of stuff to get rid of...baseball, basketball, football collectables for my mom and friend...so that will take up some time and I will make some money wooohoooooo!  Well peace out...tomorrow I promise I will write that thing again that was a masterpiece...plus this time it will have all the correct spelling and grammer and will contain more than I had originally wrote.  Peace
