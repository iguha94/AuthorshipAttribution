         well I got my car back the other day and something was already wrong with it...which makes me mad. It seems that they might have engaged in a little bit of sabotage. When they dropped the fuel tank (which they did not have to do) they removed part of the exhaust system...well when they put it all back together they put a shield on improperly and that little shield was jammed behind a sensor. The way it was jammed would eventually cause the sensor to break off...now I am sure this little sensor would be expensive...especially seeing the way it would break off requiring the replacement of most of the exhaust system. They also let down one of the mufler retaining systems...and when they put it back they only screwed it in maybe two turns...so it was making a racket and would have eventually fallen off allowing the muffler to hit the ground.  Well needless to say I fixed it all. I am not all that pleased...and when I confronted them about it they only said "wow you have had nothing but problems with that car"...well it seems that more of my problems have been caused by them...I don't think I will be taking the car back there.  My grandmother has a tumor in her lung and it has to come out...and then they will know whether it is cancerous or not. They seem to have to remove the entire lobe. So over the next month my normal hell will go into overdrive...I just hope they give her good drugs to keep her out of pain...and I hope she does alright...  Well off to look for a job
