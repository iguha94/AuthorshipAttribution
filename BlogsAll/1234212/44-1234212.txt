         Last night I had this bomb diggity of a dream.  It had to do with campaigning or my idea of campaigning. Grass roots of sorts using new ideas of marketing. What needs to happen for someone to beat Bush is to get to the root of the problem. There is not a great deal of grass roots campaigning going on. With the exception of one campaign and that is the  Dean  camp.   We need to see a return to that to get the people that have been alienated by the whole process back into the process. After all this is our America. Regardless of what you think we all can actually make a difference. It is true that lots of money can buy the presidency as we have seen it in the last election and may well see it again (think about it Bush will spend a quarter of a million on his campaign against whomever runs against him).  How can anyone dream of beating that kind of money. Well we can start by using technology. We can use it to make politicians accountable to us. We can demand to be heard at the debates through Instant Messaging technology. We can communicate with them and have them answer questions important to us and debate the issues that matter to us. We can demand through that a higher standard of politician. If people fire off questions and topics at them in real time then they have to be able to answer us, if they can't then we obviously we know that they aren't capable of thinking on the fly or are groomed by higher powers.   How can we accomplish getting into these debates. By getting behind someone who will do it for us. Maybe  Dean  will help us in this. Insist debates that include real people not just a selected few, and not just reporters.  I don't know whether or not we can do it...but it is worth a try.
