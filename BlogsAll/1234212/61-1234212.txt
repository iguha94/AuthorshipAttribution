         Well I think I may be getting out tomorrow...so that would be really nice.   I have gotten Jesse's box in the mail so when I get back home I have work to do which is also great...gives me something to do when I get there and keep my mind off of having to do all the treatments and having to dope myself with Benadryl. I just am not a big fan of drugging myself with that stuff because it does make me really groggy.   Well I am going to get a little surfing out of my system for today...I really think that I am addicted to the internet big time...when I got on for even just a few minutes it was like cocaine for the fingers and the eyes...it was like my addiction came right back hardcore...so yes folks I have found something that I have been able to get addicted to...and that is the internet....heheheh  One good thing is that while I am addicted I don't feel the need to knock over a convenience store to get money to get a fix...because in the end the internet is pretty much free for anyone who seeks it out...because we can still freely access it at out local libraries and even hospitals...so I guess while it is like any other addiction that can ruin lives...the internet is a little different in that at least you don't have to pay a seedy dude to get your fix...  Enough of that for the day...
