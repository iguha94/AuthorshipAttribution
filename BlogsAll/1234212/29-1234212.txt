         spent most of the day in bed...at least until 3PM...tonight I will actually get to bed at a reasonable time as I need to be up for tomorrow...my mom will be back from MS and has a truck load of collectables to be unloaded, semi-cataloged, and packed away again...  Today I almost finished cleaning up my room...I at least got my TV, Stereo, VCR up here and set up. That was a freakin chore...now I have it all hooked up and I have my computer tied to the TV which allows me to watch all sorts of videos from my PC on my TV...that is so freakin money yo!   Plus I can play games on the TV screen as well...and that is kewl as hell! SOF2 actually looks good on my TV...all I would need to do is stretch my keyboard and mouse over to my bed and play from there so I would be in front of the TV...I may give myself the ability to do this once I get some extension cords for both my mouse and keyboard...I have one I just need the second one.  Right now I am updating this blog, looking for a cheap price on Ebay for a Nikon Coolpix SQ (neat little camera), and getting ready to hit the sack (my meds are kicking in).  I need a new camera and the Coolpix SQ would fit the bill 3.1Megapixel Camera, teeny tiny in size, and has a lot of cool features...I think I will try and get one this week as I have a lot of photos to take of all these collectables...already have my scanner set up, just need the camera to really get all those things moved...  It looks like there will be many items that will sell for close to a grand or more...and plenty of other things to sell...  That makes me happy cause my mom could use the cash, I can use the cash and get some of the things I need to...like new laptop and a digital camcorder, and maybe a TabletPC...maybe I will be able to fullfill all my gadget wishes by the end of the year! YAY!
