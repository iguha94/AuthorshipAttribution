         Well...I had one of the most interesting dreams that I have had in a long time last night. It probably was the hottest and most bothered I have gotten in a long time over anyone or anything. Wow!  I had a dream about someone for which I have had an attraction to for quite some time. I am sure she knows about it...its not like I hide it very well. Everytime I get around her (which isn't at all very often...as a matter of fact last time I saw her she was in a coat and there was close to a foot of snow on the ground and I saw her for maybe three minutes) I get all gooey inside. Well I think dirty thoughts about her from time to time....but good christ last night. If what happened in my dream ever ever comes true it will be the most wild excellent thing that ever happens to me period. After that my life would be complete. The only thing that would be better is if we were to go out...but I doubt that will ever happen. For you see I would have to be a better man. I mean by a long shot. I would need to do a lot in my life to elevate it from where it is I fear.   Its not that she would be high maintenance or anything...but I would want to better so that I could be better around her. If you have ever had a person in your life like that then you know what I mean.  Anyway the dream was wild...and I would hope that I could have that dream more often...if only I knew what set it off then I would recreate those circumstances over and over...kinda like a groundhog day of dreams.
