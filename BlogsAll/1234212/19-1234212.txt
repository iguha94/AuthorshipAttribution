         Ok so now I am getting pretty sure about this whole gut thing. I think that it is plugging up fo sho now. It will be a few more days until I am 100% sure but right now I am 90% sure that is the cause of all the problems.  Let me put it this way...imagine constipation times five...but regular things don't work to get rid of this because more than likely it isn't poo that is blocking the way...it is a mucus plug...usually they get about the size of a small fist. Plus it doesn't usually strike in the colon (where it would be easy to get at with a chemical enema) but it strike up way far in the gut where they can only get at it with strong drano like chemicals that either go in through a tube down your nose or another chemical that you can chug. If they can't get it with chemicals they have to cut it out...  Well some of the signs of this happening are extreme gastric pain, constipation for two or more days, fevers, and throwing up what looks like poo from you gut (basically your gut backs up and the only opening available to it is your mouth). Now I have most of the symptoms but not all are presenting as normal...I am constipated but I still pass a little poo now and then...I haven't had a fever (until tonight that is), and the gastric pain has been more in my back than stomach, and I have been throwing up but right now I contribute that to coughing (although what I threw up a few minutes ago would be considered bowel crap).   So over the next few days I will see...if everything I put down tries to come up...then I know that it is blocked...if I double over in screaming pain and my stomach gets distended...then I know it is blocked...if my guts explode and stomach turns green...then I know I am fucked royally.  Night all...and thus ends another glorious day in my life.
