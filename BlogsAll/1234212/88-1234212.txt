         Well I am installing Longhorn Alpha on my desktop box...so far creamy. I did an upgrade...but I would rather have a fresh install so I am re-installing it on a clean HD.   What I saw of it while I ran it for a few minutes I liked.  I tried a few months back to run it...but the build was way to early and buggy. Now it is more mature and easier to work with.  Also all the drivers I threw to the new OS it liked so I think I will run it for the time being.  Well I am going to monitor it and give updates as things go on.  Oh yeah I figured out what is going on with the desktop system...it just doesn't have enough juice to run at the speeds it should. So I am going to be replacing it and give my mom my box...with the specs that I posted before.  The new box will be a Soltek EQ3401M...that will be creamy as it has room in the system for two optical drives and two hard drives. Plus it has a mega 250watt power supply.  The power supply is key here. Becuase that current little box has a 200watt power supply and it just can't keep up with the requirements of the system that I am running. To many whats are being drawn off.  Plus the box just looks creamy.  What it looks like.   So I should have all the things upgraded by mid-week next week. That will be hella cool. The drive bays are stealthed on it so it looks hella sweet.   I am happy that I will be able to get everything ready for an extended stay in the hospital. In the near future I fear that I will be spending a lot of time there and if I am going to have a system and I can't afford a good laptop for some time then I may as well go ahead and make sure that my system is portable yet powerfull.  I am off to monitor the install now. Peace.
