         Well Izzy is finally starting to blow here...I was outside just a few minutes ago and the winds are picking up and it has started to rain a little bit more than what it was earlier.  I love inclement weather. I would really love to go drivin right now...but it is late and I am tired...and I am still on house arrest. Tomorrow I will get to go out and play in it...I have to work a few hours tommorow evening.  I started my mods on my box today and almost (I say almost because I am able to fix it all) screwed it all up. I was trying to make nice curvy windows...but it is very difficult when you just don't have the right tools! Tomorrow when I head out I am stopping by a Wal-Mart to pick up some spray paint...I am going to spray paint the entire thing (with the execption of the front plate) black...that means I have to strip out all the guts and go to work on getting it painted. I already got the shell painted with primer...and it will look nice when I get it all worked out. I also have to stop by a radio shack and pick up some LEDs...preferably blue ones. My next purchase will be a new keyboard mouse combo...wireless of course (I had a set but gave it to Jesse...the Logitech setup with the optical wireless mouse was to slow for gaming) and it will be from Microsoft. I still have to cut the windows from the plexi I have (the first set of windows was an utter failure) and then mount them on the case shell. When I get it all done I will post a few pics of it all. I would also like to do an OC mod to the mobo to get a little more juice out of it. I think it will look good when it is all done.  Maybe this  keyboard-mouse combo  if I can find it.  Well it is late and I have to get up for the nurse in the morning...she is replacing my port needle...that is gonna hurt a little, but it is time this set has been in for a couple of weeks.  PLUR  Oh and isn't it interesting that Clark is now a candidate...jeesh.
