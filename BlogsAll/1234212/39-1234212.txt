         I finally did get back to the person that wrote me yesterday...I wrote a long ole' email.   I also got my picture hosting problem fixed for the time being. Lets see how long it lasts...  Not much to really tell today. I finally took a bunch of pictures of the jerseys we have. I have a Kobe Bryant signed, Shaq signed, Gretsky signed...and more...tomorrow I have to figure out how to take good pics of the bats...  I am having to resort to interesting ways of photographing all this stuff. Tomorrow will be more interesting as I have more unusual shapes to try and accurately capture with a camera.   Tomorrow I should have some of these auctions up and I will most likely pimp some links from here...because after all I am a consumer whore...  Which reminds me I need to see how much bandwidth per month I have on my host because I have a funny video that people should see. It isn't bad or gross...it really is damn funny. It is called "Rejected" and is a cartoon. Do a google search for the video and see if you can come up with it...really it is funny and if you can find it watch it, definitely worth the time to download.   I will check on my monthly transfer and see if I can host it...or if I even have enough webspace to do so... :-)  Till tomorrow when I may have some links for ya...PEACE!  And BTW if you link to me would you be so kind as to let me know...I will be more than willing to give you a link :-)
