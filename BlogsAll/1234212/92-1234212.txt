         Ok so my box isn't running as stable as I would like it to be...I think that I am suffering from HD failure...on both HD's nonetheless..crap!  We will see after this next reboot...I am going to have Norton Scan them to see if it can come up with something.  It really is a shame because most new hd's come with only a year warranty...they used to all be three years, but in these days of fast moving technology and cost cutting they dropped most of their coverage.  I am going to go ahead and shop for some new drives just in case...this just sucks ass!  Oh yeah and I feel like shit on top of it all...for the past three days I have been coughing up lots of blood! I hate that! I go to the docs on Wednesday and if I am still coughing up blood I will probably be headed back to the hospital...I know that my PFTs have dropped since I left because it feels like it.  I just hate this time of year when it comes to health. Over the past two years during this period of time I have lost over 20 percent of my lungs...so I expect I will loose another 10 percent this year to infection. That will bring me down into the 40% capacity level...and bring my already low O2 sats down to around 92 or 90 on average (they are at 93 to 94 average now)...and the most important indicator, the small lung passageways are already down to 10-12% of normal...and only bound to get lower (that is where you actually get your oxygen)...I think that I will have to seriously start to think about transplants soon...it won't be for a year or more...but I had better start to prepare myself...and make the decision as to whether or not I want to get transplants.  It just boggles the mind.
