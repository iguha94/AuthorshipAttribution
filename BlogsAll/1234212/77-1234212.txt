         Well I looked at my bosses computer today and boy is it fucked up in all sorts of ways. She has spyware, worms, bugs, virii, and just plain crapped up software. However being the guru I am I will be able to sort it all out with some time and patience.  On my way back from her place I stopped and picked up LOTR: The Two Towers and The Italian Job (which I got the wrong version...got the full screen instead of the widescreen version). I am watching LOTR now and enjoying it greatly. I just wish the sound was a little more even as it gets loud and quiet quickly. Its just meant to be watched loud.  Well I watched part of the debate on CNN tonight and Dean did much better and was allowed much more time to voice his views. In this debate he won hands down as being real and telling how he would do things. It was a nice thing to see as the other candidates (especially the ones out of Washington) all pretty much sounded the same. I was waiting for him to say a couple of times "shut the fuck up fucktards...you haven't done anything to stand up to Bushco and voted for everything he pushed through." Alas he didn't, it would have made for a more interesting debate if he had.   They are still lacking in some ways though. They need to stand up and be different, and out of the pack only two are doing just that. Dean and *gasp* Sharpton. Again I don't like Sharpton but he sure is fun to watch because he brings some life to the debate where as the rest (except for Dean) look like stiffs that have been coached on how to be more lifelike.  Well I am going to watch the rest of this and hit the sack. If you can catch the reruns as you will see what I mean.
