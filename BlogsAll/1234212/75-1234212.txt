         Hey before I head to bed I have a few things to post...from a reputable news source in the Tech world...as a matter of fact the inquirer has been dead on in its reviews and breaking news in the tech world for several years now announcing new products, previously unkown problems in software, and genrerally being dead on with predictions "from reliable inside sources"...so the following links I give you with the complete knowledge and full faith that they would not knowingly ever report anything that was questionable or false...when it comes down to it I think they are a hell of a lot more accurate than even CNN when reporting news outside of the Tech world...so here are the links....   Interesting story number 1    Interesting story number 1   Again...I trust them as a news source...I ask you to visit the pages and then follow the links...I haven't read all the stories yet but I am working on it...considering I am reading all of this on a shitty laptop screen it is taking me a while...you will notice that one link in one of the stories is already dead...as it has been killed (probably by higher powers because they don't want the info to get out...that link holds the source code which has not been independantly verified by computer security experts for the new Diebold voting machines...which Diebold happens to be run by a huge Bush supporter...an independent review would allow for security flaws to be found and for possible ways to cheat also be found...remember that recently the government sued Microsoft and one of the aims was to open the source code for independant review so that companies would be able to better write software...but I guess in a case as important as voter trust it is more important to keep things totally secret!)  So go read...read people...get off your asses and click the links!!! It is very important...is has to do with the fact that your votes may not be counted if the party in control doesn't like the way the vote is coming in....it is important to you whether you are a Republican, Democrat, Green, Independant, Nazi, any party voter...it is important to us all...it is important to voters period...  Damn and I thought that machines counting votes in a totally digital way would at least be built with good protection in them...so that votes would be counted and no one would be left out of the vote if they voted...  I am soooo mad about this whole deal...Democracy...ha for the wealthy...I guess the addage is true..."The Best Democracy Money can buy".
