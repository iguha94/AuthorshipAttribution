         so the last twenty four hours has kinda been a shit day...  For the past couple of days I have had this pain in my side...left side right about where the kidney would be only a little forward of that...it has caused me some severe stress...I am thinking with the recent spreading of the uncomfortable feeling that is currently spreading round the entire belly that maybe I am experiencing another partial or full blockage of the bowel.  Now normally this isn't such a huge deal...but for me I always get the nurse or doctor who thinks that they can get it with an enima...well they can't as these reside far north of where an enima can reach. So what they end up doing is having to give me some sort of turbo lax for days on end to get me flushed through...one good thing about this...is this...if it is a bowel blockage then I will get a hospital stay for it...and if it is a bowel blockage I will get good pain meds...cause they are the only thing that will relieve anyone of the excruciating pain that they cause...  If it is that...I hope they can find the broke piece of bowel and get it out...I know that it would originate from the same area that the four or five prior blockages originated from...so maybe they can rip that piece out and just get rid of the problem area...who knows...  other than that I am me...later today I have to run to the Drug Store and the Bank to get money to pay for drugs...so I will actually get to leave the house justifyably...wooohooo!
