         In the news as of late there has been a lot of hoopla about the leaking of Amb. Wilson's wife as a CIA operative from the Administration.  I watched a bit of the debate back and forth between the various parties and watched the press secretary come out and give a statement.  All of this back and forth leads me to believe that first and foremost it is most definitely a partisan move on the Democrats behalf simply because of what is at stake here. If it can be proven that the Administration did leak the name and Robert Novak (a CNN analyst amongst many other things) reported it in a piece he wrote for the newspaper then indeed their would be indictments of the people involved in the leak.  The leak itself was intended to send a warning out to anyone who might speak out against the Administration and its policies so that people may think twice and not speak out fearing that the Administration would use its considerable pull within the government to find anything to attack the reporter or person who might speak out. This has been a tactic that has been used repeatedly by all administrations and it must be pointed out that both parties are guilty of using such tactics whenever the opposing party is in power. It is nothing new to the overall scheme of things in Washington.  The bigger question here is did it happen, if so what will be done, also who knew inside the administration, and who authorized such a leak of sensitive material.   Also this brings into question the credibility of our secret dealings around the globe. If informants and operatives aren't protected and are to be used as pawns in political games then we may loose our best assests around the world in fear of them being found out then prosecuted and quite possibly put to death by the people they are informing on.  Another point that needs to be made is when something of this nature comes about is it the duty of the reporter to reveal his/her source if indeed the rumors are true. The answer is an unqualified yes to that question. Not because we want to discourage people from being informants, but more simply because we want to discourage blatent abuse of the reporters and the weight that their voices carry in modern media.   Leaks happen on a daily basis, but no leak like this has ever come up. It truely is of national security and pride in our foriegn intelligence services that comes to question. If we can't bring in the rogues that try and bring others down because they don't like political views or because someone doesn't like what is being said why not just go ahead and kill people off instead of tarnishing reputations...it is in the end much more human and a more forward and to the point action. Subtlety has never worked in the past, but actions do speak louder than words.  As for the administration it is claimed that the leak didn't come from the white house, but they can't confirm if it came from the administration. Well come on folks, the administration is the white house...all edicts come down from there to the various foot soldiers to be carried out. So the fact of the matter is that regardless of whether it was someone directly in the white house or someone in the broad administration is of no relevance...because they are inextricably tied to each other.  Some say that it was Karl Rove who leaked the information. If it was shame on him and he should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Besides what value is it that he would hold such sensitive documents as he is really just a political advisor and not much of anything else. To think that he would have access to such sensitive information is rediculous...and there is no doubt that he does have access to documents that really he shouldn't.  The President share cuplability in this whole mess because of what he has said in the past. He stated that he would bring back integrity to the office and that the buck would stop with him. If that is so then regardless of where the leak came from and whether or not he knew explicitely shouldn't matter because he pledged to be responsible for all actions taken in the name of his Administration.  In this search for answers I have gone looking for ways to deal with the problem seeing that it really is a problem that extends up to the President regardless of whether he tacitly knew of the events...and it brought me to the impeachment process.   In looking up the impeachment process it revealed that impeachment is really a difficult thing to do and rightfully so...but would be impossible to actually implement in this case because of the makeup of the government and how it is controlled at this point in time.  Here is the actual law that calls for and outlines what is impeachable activities.  "The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.  --U.S. Constitution, Article 2, Section 4"  The process to do so is quite convoluted and requires something that can't be achieved even if all the allegations prove true because of the makup of the congress in general.  Taken from a law website which I will give the link to at the end of this post.  "The Impeachment Process in a Nutshell  The House Judiciary Committee deliberates over whether to initiate an impeachment inquiry.   The Judiciary Committee adopts a resolution seeking authority from the entire House of Representatives to conduct an inquiry. Before voting, the House debates and considers the resolution. Approval requires a majority vote.   The Judiciary Committee conducts an impeachment inquiry, possibly through public hearings. At the conclusion of the inquiry, articles of impeachment are prepared. They must be approved by a majority of the Committee.   The House of Representatives considers and debates the articles of impeachment. A majority vote of the entire House is required to pass each article. Once an article is approved, the President is, technically speaking, "impeached" -- that is subject to trial in the Senate.   The Senate holds trial on the articles of impeachment approved by the House. The Senate sits as a jury while the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial.   At the conclusion of the trial, the Senate votes on whether to remove the President from office. A two-thirds vote by the Members present in the Senate is required for removal.   If the President is removed, the Vice-President assumes the Presidency under the chain of succession established by Amendment XXV."   As you can see it has to go through many stages and all of those stages at this point are controlled by Republicans...so even if there were clear and obvious wrong doings it would be impossible to actually proceed with an impeachment no matter what the public outcry calls for.  F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr., (Jim), is a Republican Member of Congress is the head of the Judiciary Committee so you can see that even if it got to this stage it would be shot down. The committee is stocked with more Republicans than Democrats. Here is the list.  Republican Members                Mr. Hyde (Illinois)                     Mr. Coble (North Carolina)         Mr. Smith (Texas)                       Mr. Gallegly (California)             Mr. Goodlatte (Virginia)              Mr. Chabot (Ohio)                      Mr. Jenkins (Tennessee)            Mr. Cannon (Utah)                     Mr. Bachus (Alabama)                Mr. Hostettler (Indiana)           Mr. Green (Wisconsin)               Mr. Keller (Florida)                    Ms. Hart  (Pennsylvania)           Mr. Flake (Arizona)                  Mr. Pence (Indiana)                   Mr. Forbes (Virginia)                Mr. King (Iowa)     Mr. Carter (Texas)     Mr. Feeney (Florida)   Mrs. Blackburn (Tennessee)    Democratic Members    Mr. Conyers (Michigan) Ranking Mr. Berman (California) Mr. Boucher (Virginia) Mr. Nadler (New York)  Mr. Scott (Virginia) Mr. Watt (North Carolina) Ms. Lofgren (California) Ms. Jackson Lee (Texas) Ms. Waters (California) Mr. Meehan (Massachusetts)   Mr. Delahunt (Massachusetts) Mr. Wexler (Florida)  Ms. Baldwin (Wisconsin) Mr. Weiner (New York)   Mr. Schiff (California) Ms. Sanchez (California)     So as you can see the votes would go pretty much along party lines (20 Republicans and 16 Democrats) and the vote to get it out of committee would be shot down before it would even be considered for consideration that an impeachment might be nesecary.  If the allegations prove true than he should definitely have the impeachment process started as he would have broken the law...in addition it would include VP Cheney as well as others in the Administration.  The plain fact is that Mr. Robert Novak should indeed reveal his sources if nothing else in private to the appropriate authorities so an investigation could proceed. Without that key bit of evidence the investigation will die on the vine so to speak.  Remember that we actually impeached President Clinton and the vote was against removing him from office. The vote wasn't agaisnt what was at the time the Whitewater scandal as they could not find the documentation to actually use in the process but instead the moved ahead anyway with the fact that he lied about getting oral sex from an intern. Basically they impeached on the fact that he lied.In the end it wasn't enough to impeach him.  That brings up special prosecutors. This strange phenominom was implemented in the seventies as a way to get independant investigators into the mix as it was seen that the Justice department often comes into conflict on matters of this importance seeing that the head of the Justice Department is appointed by the sitting President...and often the head of the Justice Department is reluctant to do anything against the very person that gave him/her the job. This bit of legislation had a sunset clause put on it and it lapsed in the late nineties (or thereabouts) and was not reinstated because it was seen that independant investigations often proved fruitless in the matters they persued partly in responce to the fact that they were often denied the very information they needed to proceed.  So getting an independant investigation into this matter just simply won't happen because there is no law requiring it.  On another note it has been well documented and seen in Washington over the past few years that outside investigations by any body have also wained and in most cases simply not happened because of the often used "if you question the policies and intentions of the Administration then you are a traitor" view. So many things have happened that warrent investigations regardless of who is in power that just simply haven't happened because of the stigma of being labled an unpatriotic american is simply to much to fight against seeing that the White House has on several occassions used its executive powers to launch probes into investigators and them leaked the information to the media so as to discredit the investigators.  While at this point we do not know who leaked the information, my money is on a high admistration official that wanted to attempt to intimidate and discredit Amb. Wilson...a purely political move that if his investigation into the Niger uranium deals had become common public knowledge that discredited the claims of the Bush Administration that Hussein was trying to get Uranium from them would most certainly lead to the questioning of the policy of war in Iraq.  Also I read my new issue of Time today and they brought out some pretty interesting information to the effect of because of the widespread corruption within the Iraqi government Hussein may well of thought he had weapons when indeed he didn't because of the lies and misreports given to him on those weapons programs. It would seem that the scientists and people in charge of those programs knew better than to screw around with the UN on this...their only mistake (which can be excused) is not having documented the destruction of said weapons. If they had documented the destruction of the weapons surely they would have been put to death if the documents made it to Hussein...as we all know he aspired to have all sorts of weapons. The deception that was perpitrated was to protect the lives of the scientists in charge of the programs from the very dictator that was telling them to "build them or die" so they had great reason to lie and not leave a paper trail about the lies.  It comes down to this folks...Hussein had aspirations to achieve nuclear weapons and terrible other weapons...but in reality his own scientists, who were just that and not party fanatics, lied to him to save their own asses while giving him the documentation that they were making progress even though it was all a big hoax. They did admit however that they kept a few weapons back to test the shelf life of the weapons but they were eventually turned over to the UN inspectors who then mislabled them and lost them in the clutter...so even the small amount that we have found (something like maybe a couple dozen warheads of chemical weapons) were in fact already documented and known of by the UN but through snafu's in their procedures they we not kept track of and eventually destroyed.  When all of this washes out in the end the Presidents rational excuse for pre-emptive strikes will prove to be a bad policy based on the fact that people can simply lie about the extent of programs...and it goes to show that not even dictators can know everything that is going on in their own country....  I am pretty sure that Bush has no clue of our own chemical and biological research that is thriving even though he touts the official position that we are destroying out stockpiles. That gives him deniability when it comes down to it...he didn't know the scientists were developing new weapons...because our policy is officially to dismantle those projects.  We will all have to come to the understanding that our leaders are not omnipotant people and can't have detailed knowledge of everything that goes on in government even though they claim to have intimate knowledge of what all is actually going on. Maybe that is a good thing, maybe it is a bad thing...but that is just simply the way that all governments do business.  The link that I promised to the articles of impeachment and the process in which it goes through. I plagarized huge chunks of the writings and am not ashamed as they state very clearly the law and how it actually works.   Impeachment Process in detail.    House Judiciary Committee Website.
