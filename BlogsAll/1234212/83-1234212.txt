         For the first time ever I bought a book and read it all the way through in one day.  What is this marvel of writing brilliance you may ask?  "Dude, Where's My Country" by Michael Moore.  Pure genious...get it and read it...then reread it. The book is just excellent and he is able to bring together many of the thoughts all of us left-wingers have been feeling for quite some time. In addition he basically says in some places "suck it up and stop being such whiney little twits". Those are my words...and they are great.  It is a great book with bits like this on pg 72 "Ethiopia (nothing like sending a squad of starving children to help!)" and this one on pg 71 "Afghanistan? What exactly was their contribution going to be? Horses? Ten sticks and a stone? Don't they have their own problems at the moment?" both on the Coalition of the Willing.  Or this one on the left admitting it has made some mistakes a dealing with them "Why are you still bitching about right-wing author Ann Coulter? Sure, she's as crazy as a loon, but she's got more balls than the entire Democratic Leadership Council. You're just jealous we don't have an Ann Coulter. And stop looking at her damn legs! That's why she's got you so jumbled up!"  And this one "Animals don't have rights. Yes, they should be treated "humanely." Yes, Tyson Foods and all the others that "harvast" chickens are disgusting. But "freeing" chickens from their factory farms is idiotic. They don't know how to survive in the wild and they're just going to get hit by a truck...This shit just makes me wanna go kick my dog." (a bit was left out of that one about milk and whatnot)  I really like this book.  Today I bought it and Al Franken's "Lies and the lying liars that tell them" and I will start that tomorrow.  Well I am going to be...as it has been a long ass day so far!
