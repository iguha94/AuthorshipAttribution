         I am really hating this bidding thing...simply because I am on a budget kinda...I mean I could get an uber camera and spend a bit more than what I am bidding at right now...but I would never hear the end of it because my mom and grandmother are cheap and wanna get the cheapest thing around...even though they wouldn't even have a clue as to what is worth the money and what isn't.  They would go to wal-mart and pick up the cheapest digital camera and then bring it home like a prize without realizing that first it is a piece of crap, and second they overpaid for it.   I need to be able to go to about 320 for what I am looking for...and I may have to do that. I will just have to hear the heat...but the cost will be readily made up in the ensuing auctions that I will be having.   They wanna get started tomorrow selling all this shit, but the stuff they want to sell is stuff that needs to be photographed first. It is just a big ass mess and I am bought at wits ends with them both. They want it done tomorrow and aren't willing to help with the legwork.  Well over the next few days between trying to get a camera and figuring out what I should start my auctions for some of this crap at it will be a busy few days. Plus I need to go out and get a money order and a few other things....like pepsi...I have a pepsi shortage, I am down to a dozen cans and it will be critical soon...hehehe  Its hard to believe that almost a month of this house arrest shit is already over...I wish it would go faster...and hey it may well go faster partly because I have auctions to hold, a virus in my lungs that isn't letting go and will land me in the hospital soon, and money to be made...as well as a lot of learning to do!  Piss on me...
