         Ok so today was a washout. I slept most of the day. This weekend took a lot out of me. First Jesse was here. Second we had some guy come in and look at our collectables. Now it wouldn't have been so bad but he literally went through it like a tornado and didn't put anything back...plus he was rough with some of it because he wasn't interested in it (like star wars figures and spawn stuff)...  He wants a lot of the shit...but I don't think he will come back with a price that will be reasonable. He was going through the mini-helmets and wants them all but I think he thinks that we were going to leave the most valuable in the group and he would just pay 9 or 10 per helmet even for the autographed ones (which we have a few that are valued at around 150 bucks). Well that ain't gonna fly at all. Also he just wants all the cards (even the graded cards we have) but again I think he thinks that he will get it all for nothing...but he won't. He will have to come up with at least 40 percent of book value.   So that is why I am tired. Plus I am also pretty ill. I go Wednesday to see the doc...so I expect I will be headed to the hospital that evening or Thursday. So in the meantime I have to wash clothes and get ready just in case. If I do go it will be a relief because it will be a vacation from my house as I see it...plus I will not have to really cook...all I have to do is order food.  Well I am going to try and get some sleep again...peace out ya'll.
