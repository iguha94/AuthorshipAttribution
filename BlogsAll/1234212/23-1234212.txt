         Well yesterday I found out that one of the other people that was in this whole mess with me was also sentenced on Friday. Now I haven't seen him online since then. I don't know what to think about that...I hope he didn't go away...while he may have been more involved in it all (seeing he was the others/ringleaders roommate) I don't think he was as much at fault. Today I read in the paper that he recieved a similar sentence to what I got...but if that is so then why isn't he online...this poses an interesting question. Did he indeed go up the river for this so to speak, and if so for how long?  All of these questions I have and no way to answer them just yet.   Well everything is getting inline here at the house for this six months of sollitude...I have my room arranged a little more comfortably...no the only thing will to bring my TV up here and get it some cable or something. I have a lot of DVD's and Movies to watch so I will be at least somewhat ammused for a bit. Plus with all the money I will be saving by not having to drive around and do shit I will be able to buy so many more DVD's. I can see that Amazon.com and others will become part of my monthly purchases.  I just might sign up for another DVD Club membership to get some movies....hehehehe
