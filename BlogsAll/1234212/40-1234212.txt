         Ok so I got all of Office Beta 2003 installed and it is da bomb baby. When I upgraded from Office 2000 to Office XP the changes were small and not really noticable. However this new version really is worthy of the Upgrade status for those who are back at Office 97 or 2000. This will be the new Office suite to get a hold of.   Outlook 2003 is really slick and powerful and has some great Junk Mail filtering built in already even in this Beta 2 build. It catches a lot of it from Hotmail and that is great. That is something also that they have fixed in this version. Office XP didn't play well with multiple Hotmail accounts, Oulook Express was much better in that sense. Now this Beta fixed many of the bugs and is very powerful.   Today I got my camera. The Nikon Coolpix 3100. It is also a great little camera. I think I will have a lot of fun with it.   Right now I am watching the Al Gore speech that he gave earlier today from  MoveOne.org . So far it is a great speech. Here is a direct link to it.    The Speech  You will need Realplayer and probably broadband to view it. While Gore is somewhat of a bore...the speech is still good and brings out the idea that we have been mislead by someone who has nothing to gain as he isn't going to run for office...at least now.  Watch it and let me know what you think.  Peace (ps there may be another update in a bit once I finish with the speech)
