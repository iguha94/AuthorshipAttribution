         I am booting up the laptop as I write this. So I will finally be able to say that I have my thesis on religion up and online. Damn passwords...laptop...typing here...there...jeesh it would be nice to have one keyboard, mouse, and monitor station for all your computers...this may signify the idea that I might need to soon invest in a KVM switch...  here are my plans for the near future...hopefully over the rest of this year.  First: Get a laptop...nice big desktop replacement type for the road. Sager system with Dual Channel DDR 2.4+ P4 HT ATi Graphics, gig o ram Second: Build a new mini-system like I have now based around a Shuttle XPC with Dual Channel DDR and 3.0+ P4 HT and dual 17 inch flat panels ATi Graphics, gig o ram Third: Wireless Gear 802.11G based or better...a system that supports all the subsets of 802.11 Fourth: Cheapy Tablet PC (some will be coming out this year that are under the 1 grand mark) Fifth: Build from Scrap parts that I have a server up for serving media using drives out of current main machine (think sophisticated NAS) and maybe basic Web-Serving capabilities (but file serving comes first). Sixth: Get a cheap PocketPC Seventh: Get a decent Digital Camera (at least better than what I have now as it eats 10 batteries every twenty minutes) Eigth: Get a decent but cheap Digital Camcorder Nineth: Get a backpacky type thing that will hold all the portable things...and still be somewhat comfortable (hopefully loaded weight will be less than 20 pounds with the laptop, tablet pc, pocket pc, camera, and camcorder, and all the extra cords and crap for them all plus a wireless bridge for when I get to a place that has broadband but no wireless....roll my own network on the fly)  The laptop will be in the 2 grand range, the Tablet in the 1 grand range, the new PC, in the 1500 range, Pocket PC in the 400 range, Camera 350, and camcorder 600 or so...gimme bout eight grand and I could have them all...now mind you I have a lot of work coming up this fall...and I should be able to swing at least a few of these things...I don't need them all...but they would be nice...this is just a wish list...  Oh and I wanna get a new Cell Phone later this fall...I am going to continue with Sprint but I want to get a Digital Camera Phone...and a pittsburgh number...my current number is an Indiana PA number...  ok...ok...so now for what some have been waiting for...lemme post this and then I will post the writing I did.
