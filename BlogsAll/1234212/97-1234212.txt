         Dean chose to go with Private financing in his campaign by turning down 19 Million in public funds. So it is now for all of us (his supporters) to give a little to the campaign.  He made a very eloquant speech that can be seen on my link to DeanTV.   He sent out Emails to his supporters (about 30,000 votes were counted) to ask what he should do...and most people chose to go with Private funding of his campaign.  Now I am for campaign finance reform, but right now we are in a state of emergency. We need Bush out and Dean (or any democrat for that matter...and this coming from a registered Republican).   Bush turned down the public financing so that he could build a war-chest of about 200 million bucks to fight off a non-existant primary foe. So what will that money actually go towars...well he will be running smear campaigns to try and discredit any Democrat that may pose opposition to his re-election bid.  Right now Dean is at around 20 million for the primaries...if he chose public financing his total cap would have been 49 million or so to run his campaign on...that is hugely unfair.  all we need is 2 million people to contribute 100 bucks to the campaign to help him out. I will be giving 100 bucks for the primary and another 100 bucks for the general election if Dean is chosen to run.  You can see a link on my page here to go and give him some money. My total right now is 0...but I will be adding to it soon (like this month).  You can go give money and you will be credited with giving the money...so go do it...we can all spare 100 bucks over the next 10 months...or less. So I encourage you to vote with your dollars and help Dean become the next President of the USA.  Go ahead you know you want too :-)
