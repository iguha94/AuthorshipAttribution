         I just took a blogger poll...thing is the polls that they never allow you to write in things or give you enough choices to really get a poll sample down correct...  For instance one of the questions is how long have you blogged with blogger...without asking how much you have blogged in the past...and then one of the questions is were you one of the first in your group and did you introduce it to other or did others introduce you to it..  Well a fair question would have been to find out how long people have been blogging...for me it has basically been on and off for around 4 years now...with my original blog type forum on a site called Camarades...when it was a free web cam site...I had typically 20 users on my webcam all the time...and I updated the page almost daily with what was going on...so that could certainly be considered blogging...then I laid off of it for a while until I moved too my apartment in MS where I set up my own web server and hosted my own blog...then when I moved back up here I started blogging on /. for almost six months before moving over to blogger...and I have been with them ever since because they have been very reliable and easy to use...  Over time my blog has evolved somewhat and I would love to continue to use this service but in the future I will probably move to a movable type based blog...I would love to get the pay version of blogger as well...and I may do that just to keep it simple...with that package you get photo hosting and expanded ability to move things and customize...and that is what I need...so maybe that is what I will do in the end...  Well enough for tonight...I have a nasty sinus infection that started yesterday and has been kicking my ass all day today and is worse tonight...so if it isn't any better tomorrow I will have to call the doctor and figure out what we want to do...because the damn thing is migrating south for the winter...and south is the lungs and I don't need that again.  Well I am off to bed...night all!
