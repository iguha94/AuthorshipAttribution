         ok so it has been a few days since I posted last...bad me.  Well the port was de-accessed a week later than expected so I had to lug all my meds out to hershey with me. That was a pain in the ass, but all is well and things are relatively good now. I am feeling a bit better...altough my cough is worse than ever and has made me puke for the last two days. When I went to the docs this last time I really had impressive lung function scores so that was a bonus...but the drawback is even though I have good scores the important scores which are the small airway passages (the airways that have Alveoli in them) have continued to drop and are now down to 9 percent of what they should be. That score alarms me and now I know why I feel so out of breath during even light excersize (like walking up a flight of stairs).  On Friday I have to go to court to find out what my punishment is...hopefully it won't be to harsh. It really comes down to what the judge orders. The Prosectutor filed a really important document stating that I have been very helpful in the investigation and that they would not oppose a downward departure from my current offense level...all that means is that they have no problem with me getting probation. Again though it comes down to what the judge orders.  While out in Hershey on the way back I stopped at my ex's place in Hanover...she has gotten hotter since I dated her no shit. She trimmed off twenty pounds or so and is rockin...any guy that bags her would be lucky. We had a good visit and she even bought me dinner...which was hella kewl.  Well that is all I have to tell at this point...I will most likely post again after Fridays proceedings to let people know how I faired.  Wish me luck!
