         Jesse will be here tomorrow. I am building his computer and I am actually looking forward to it. He got some hot stuff and I wanna see how fast it is and get that puppy purring. It will be k-rad.  To everyone out there worried I want to re-assure you that I am not ignoring my health. I am doing everything that I can to stay as well as I can until this coming Wednesday when I have an appointment. When I go I will be headed to the hospital that day or maybe the next depending on when they can get a bed for me.  So until then I will soldier on...plus when I go in I will be more than likely going into the ICU for a few days because I have to be de-sensitised again to Pennicillian drugs...or at least the one they will put me on. It isn't so bad because in the ICU they wait on you hand and foot and are glad when they have a semi-concious patient...and I am always at least that.  Well I am going to kinda head to bed as I need to get a little rest...I will post a little longer tomorrow as I will be showing Jesse around his new box as well as showing him more about this blog service. I am also thinking about making a custom layout and see how that goes...I may just fool with the colours though...who knows.  Till tomorrow...peace out everyone.  Again thanks to those who read the site, and even more thanks to those who write me. I enjoy getting email and I would love to get more.
