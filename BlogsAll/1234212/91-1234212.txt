         I found a couple of 160GB SATA Hitachi drives...currently the top rated for 158 a piece. 8MB Cache, 7200RPM...Hitachi bought out IBM storage a while back. IBM got a bad rap because of some faulty drives...but out of all the ones I have used they have been the most reliable...although I did not have that particular model. Plus the drives offer a three year warranty...hard to come by. Also the shipping is included. They have 250GB versions...but they are much more expensive. Like 315 bucks...now I ain't gonna pay that for another 100 gigs of space...nope.  I would need to get a couple of external cages for the drives I already have...as they are faulty but not dead yet....so I could use them for extra storage...which would mean that I would need another power strip and possibly a small nuclear plant to power it all.  If I get the external housing units for those and some of my other drives I would have about 510GB of storage total...more that enough to rip my entire CD collection plus some.  2 - 160GB = 320GB (7200RPM SATA) 2 - 60GB = 120GB (currently in my box to be put into external units 7200RPM PATA) 1 - 40GB = 40GB (7200RPM PATA) 1 - 40GB = 40GB (5400RPM PATA)  = 510GB of total storage  That would give me plenty of room to play with I would think. I have some movie stuff that I need to get on here and convert to digital format so I would need that kind of storage overall.  Well I am extremely tired and I am going to pass out for a while...  peace all  oh yeah and it hasn't crashed since I rolled back my Nvidia Drivers...
