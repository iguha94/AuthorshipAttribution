         Here is a letter I wrote this morning to a devotee in China who has a friend that is worried that a vegetarian diet isn't healthy:  Haribol,  I would think that in China especially people would be more inclined NOT to eat meat.  Is she worried about protein?  Tofu is an excellent protein substitute.  In fact at least here in the US people eat too much protein.  The increase in protein that the kidneys have to deal with results in calcium being taken out of bones, and this results in osteoporosis, very fragile bones that can easily break.  This is actually a very serious problem here and billions of dollars are spent every year fixing broken hips that are due to osteoporosis, which again is partly caused by a diet too high in protein.  Additionally, the high fat and cholesterol amounts found in a meat-based diet can also contribute to heart disease by increasing the chances for plaque buildup inside of the arteries.  This plaque can block blood vessels and cause strokes, heart attacks, all kinds of heart disease, and possibly/potentially death.  By lowering the amount of fat and cholesterol in the diet (most easily done by removing animal products from the diet, as cholesterol is only found in animal products) people can control their cholesterol levels and significantly reduce their chances for a heart attack or other cardiac disease.  A meat based diet is also ecologically unsound as it requires vast amounts of resources to produce.  For example, it takes sixteen pounds of grain to produce one pound of beef.  This sixteen pounds of grain could be used to feed approximately 48 people.  One pound of beef can feed my husband one meal.  So it is very wasteful in terms of consuming excess resources, both in grain and water, and contributes directly to the global problem of hunger. In the United States alone, 80% of the grain grown is fed to livestock, not people.  If just ten percent of the land now used for growing livestock feed were used to grow grains for human consumption, we could significantly impact the problem of starvation throughout the world. Farming livestock also negatively impacts the environment by creating massive amounts of water pollution.  This is something that here in North Carolina where I live we have to deal with on a very personal level, since there are a high number of hog farms in the area.  These farms stink for miles around as well as make the water unusable. Recently, mad cow disease has been in the news again, as well as particularly in China, outbreaks of SARS being traced to people eating civet cats.  Both of these diseases would not be transmitted to humans if they didn't eat these animals.  Also, in this country at least, meat is very expensive compared to the cost of beans/legumes and cereal grains.  So one can save a lot of money by removing meat from the diet.  A vegetarian diet has also been scientifically proven to increase performance and endurance in athletes.  Despite what the media would like for people to believe, changing to a vegetarian diet actually improved stamina and recovery time in athletes.  So there is no real basis for believing that a meatless diet is harmful to the health.  In countries all over the world, people have been following vegetarian diets successfully for thousands of years.  Many studies have shown that people who live in a country or culture that favours a non-meat-centred diet suffer less cardiovascular, kidney, and gastric disease as well as less cancers.  This is due to a variety of factors-the decrease in fibre, the increased fat, cholesterol, and protein, and also the fact that pesticides and environmental pollutants become concentrated in meat tissues (and are eaten by the person).  At first it was thought that this was simply due to genetic factors, but it was later shown that when people changed to a western, meat-based diet, their rates of all the above diseases and cancers soon matched those of western countries.  From an ethical standpoint, the way most animals raised for livestock are treated is disgusting.  Animals are abused, crammed into cages too small, beaten to death, starved, force fed, bled to death, and subjected to all kinds of tortures and torments before finally being killed.  Even in the United States, which prides itself on being so advanced and liberal, the treatment of animals on farms is unregulated, and horrible things happen all the time.  Animals, especially birds, are regularly mutilated, packed into cages that prevent them from moving at all, have tubes shoved down their throats to be force fed, and are basically driven to insanity by the conditions they are forced to live in.  Despite activist groups bringing this to people's attention, they continue to eat meat and thus allow this cruelty to continue.  By eating a meat-based diet, we participate in this circle of violence.  A great number of philosophers and spiritually advanced people have come to the conclusion that we cannot advance ourselves on a spiritual platform if we continue to allow innocent beings to be victimised and tortured for our own pleasure, and that the move towards a nonviolent lifestyle is absolutely necessary if we are going to make any spiritual progress. This conclusion has been reached by people from every religious persuasion as well as non-religious philosophers.  So for reasons of health, environmental concern, ethical consideration and also to improve one's economic development, a meatless diet is the way to go.  As a nurse I am confident on a scientific level that a vegetarian diet is more healthy than a meat-based one.  My personal experience is that in the years I have been a vegan and vegetarian I have experienced no adverse effects to my health.  In addition, my husband, who continues to eat meat (but not beef) on an occasional basis, has reported that at the times he does eat meat, he doesn't feel well afterwards, and often suffers from stomach upset.  (Why he continues to do it, I don't know.)  So I hope that your friend will take all these factors into consideration when making some decisions about her diet.  And I hope that this has been helpful.  :)  Love Satyavati          ');"> postCount(' ');
