         I don't feel well today.  There was a brief announcement posted   here  about an egroup I've started for Gurudeva's disciples.  As of right now, membership's tripled.  Everyone's quiet so far, but I'm hoping the group takes off and does well.  Meanwhile today I've not done much.  I did go to B&N and get myself a nice vegan cookbook (I am not vegan, but vegetarian) and then to the grocery store for some tomatoes.  I cook with tomatoes EVERY day.  Right now there's some fresh cheese I've made draining in the kitchen and I'm planning on making a dish called Rajma with it.  If you want the recipe, let me know. Scott's been caught up in the playoffs, and between time I've just been freezing, dozing, and watching Walking with Dinosaurs.  I love anything that has to do with geology, paleontology, or archaeology.  I was really looking for books about those types of things today, but didn't find anything that caught my eye.  I have to work an extra day this week, so I don't know how much I'll be blogging.  Leave me a comment, will you!  Give a little encouragement.  A considerable number of people read this blog, why I don't know, but only one's left a comment so far.  Just click on the link and leave me a note!    ');"> postCount(' ');
