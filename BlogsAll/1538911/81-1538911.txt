         Apparently in some parts of NC they had snow today.  I am not sure yet whether or not I'm working tonight.  This depends on the census.  If it's low, they're going to call me off, because I'm coming in late (11) and what would be the point?  I never entertain any actual hope on this kind of thing, but it would be nice.    I've got all kinds of ideas in embryo as it were about things I'd like to write about, but I just haven't got to that stage of fruition yet.  I apologise.  I know I write very regularly here and for me to go 24 or 36 hours or even longer without anything beyond a couple of sentences is really unusual, but I would rather wait and put up something that's at least worth reading (in my opinion-you are welcome to yours) than just write something for the sake of writing.  It's like my synapses are all tangled up in gridlock or something lately.  I think I've spent too much time trying to learn how to read these EKGs, it has me all mudfuddled.  I've got my schedule all arranged and I'll have twelve days off in the beginning of April for Gurudeva's visit.  The nice thing about working three days a week is being able to do physics on the schedule like that and get twelve days off for the cost of only three PDOs.    Anyway, just like everything, this difficulty too shall pass, and things will get back to normal.  I just need to be a little patient.  You do too.  Thanks.  And chant Hare Krishna.
