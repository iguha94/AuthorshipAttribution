         Back in 1985 I went with my highschool senior class to this place called St Gabriel's.  It was a monastery/retreat center out on Shelter Island (in NY).  It was a beautiful place-not in physical beauty although it had that... it was a very peaceful place.  We stayed the weekend in these tiny rooms that just had a bed, a desk, and a sink, and we all ate together in a big room.  In retrospect it was a lot like how it is up at the temple, a monastic lifestyle.  I remember being very taken in by it, and that it made a very big impression on me, that simple God centered lifestyle.  Now, 19 years later, I am closer to that goal and lifestyle than I ever was within the Catholic church.  I did a websearch to look for St. Gabriel's, and found out an arsonist burned it down in 1999.  It made me very sad.  It was a very special place.  Whoever was responsible for that will surely have to pay.  Today is post-op 3, and the percocet isn't working as well as it was.  I'm still hurting a lot.  Tonight is the Superbowl.  We're going for Carolina although neither of us are real Panthers fans-it just seems like we ought to, for loyalty's sake.  Left messages with those devotees.  I am really getting excited about Gurudeva's visit.    ');"> postCount(' ');
