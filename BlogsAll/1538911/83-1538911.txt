         I spent all day today in a class all about cardiac stuff.  My brain is pretty full.  I know in time it will get easier, but right now it just seems kind of overwhelming and too much to deal with.  You know, for the past ten years I've said I never wanted to specialise.  I always wanted to be a general medical (not surgical) nurse.  One of the reasons I chose Geriatrics as a unit when I applied back to the hospital was because it was a general unit.  And now, through no fault of my own, I'm a cardiac nurse.  Why?  I never wanted to be a cardiac nurse.    The obvious answer would be, 'well, dummy, if you don't want to be there, leave.'  I've never been one to go for the obvious.  It's too easy.  This must have happened for a reason, just like everything else and every situation I've ever found myself in.  I am not sure yet exactly why, but there's some purpose to this.  Who knows?  Maybe I'll fall in love with it.  Maybe in a year I'll decide I've had enough and go back to medicine.  Maybe I'll do it long enough to get us moved out of here, and then do nothing at all.  I don't know.  It's not that I don't want to be there, it's just that it isn't fitting in with what I thought my plan was.  Maybe that's the lesson itself, hmm?  The plan's not mine to make.  Maybe that's what this lesson is all about.  Only time will tell.          ');"> postCount(' ');
