         They say you can't catch up on sleep, but I just slept almost twelve hours straight.  Today I have some things to do-laundry, go to Eckerds and pick up whatever the doctor called in for me, get these pictures developed and so on.  It's cold here too-28 this morning, but the sun is shining and I don't feel quite as cold somehow.  I could get back in the bed and sleep some more, I think.  I actualy might do that at some point.  I found a book on how to deal with those vampire people, and I ordered it.  I have to have some relief.  So I am taking all comments and suggestions into consideration and trying how best to implemement them in my situation (supervisor and professional in a hospsital environment).  As Prabhupada used to say, we have to consider time, place, and circumstance.  How I deal with people at work is not necessarily how I deal with them in a different environment, and if I am your boss I deal with you differently than if you are my boss.  Mother Krishna Priya wants me to recuperate at the temple.  I don't think that's going to happen but it's a nice idea.  I could think about it some more and maybe go up there.  If I had an automatic I could drive myself, but I have a stick and I am not sure I'll be able to shift it.  It's a long drive.  On a good day it takes me 2 hours and 15 minutes.  It would be great to spend three or four days up there though.  Maybe, if there's room in the guest house, I really can... I have think more on this.  I'm probably going to go this weekend and buy that clicker.  Have you ever laid in bed so long you're actually sore when you get out?  I don't usually talk about politics in this blog, but I'm voting for Dean.  That's all.  Nuff said.    ');"> postCount(' ');
