         I hate feeling like an idiot.  I felt like one this morning when the cable guy showed up.  Now, we have sattelite, but we don't get local channels (yet, they say) and you know the Superbowl's comin up.  Being that he's got that whopper of a TV in there, it seems practically criminal to have to go out somewhere to watch the game.  Thus, the cable guy.  Well, I don't know anything about the daggone setup in there.  It's rigged like I don't know what.  You need a manual the size of the NYC phone book to make sense of all the components and the remotes.  There I was, pushing buttons like a complete dolt, and this man looking at me thinking I must be the stupidest person alive.  I got so irritated I had to call my husband at work and make sure there wasn't some kind of secret mojo hidden trap door button setup to push to make it all work, because the cable guy was having a problem.  Anyway, eventually he did get it set up, and apparently there isn't any mojo voodoo thing you have to do, but I still looked like an idiot, and all I want to do now is go to bed.  I spent 16 hours at work last night/this morning.  Maybe it's me and I'm just a bit testy.  On the other hand, even with sleep I don't know how to work those remotes.  Is this just a man thing, or am I a dummy?    ');"> postCount(' ');
