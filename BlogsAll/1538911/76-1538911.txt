         My brain is all full up with words like Wenkebach, sinoatrial, supraventricular and aberrancy.  I sat in that class all day and I actually had to take a nap when I got home because my brain was so full it wouldn't let me do anything else.  I have a feeling that at some future yet to be determined moment, all this cardiac stuff is going to make sense to me.  The key words there would be 'future yet to be determined.'    I've gotten used to feeling like I know what I'm doing.  The bleak reality of not really understanding this cardiac business yet is more than a little unsettling and is contributing to an overall sense of insecurity and unease.  I still know how to look at a patient, and some things you don't need to know in order to react.. but I still have this lingering fear that I'll miss something dumb, or make a stupid mistake.  In order to buck myself up and work on my self-confidence I try and remember the day that I spotted the patient having an MI right before my eyes (and this was before we were a cardiac floor) and got intervention in hand right away.  I did that without any special cardiac knowledge at all, didn't I?  So it's just got to get better from there.   The first lecture of the day was on Supraventricular Tachycardia, given by an extremely knowledgeable cardiologist who was completely and utterly over my head.  I'm very sure that she's very smart, but I didn't understand 10% of what she talked about.  That got my day off to a depressing start.  The next lecture, also given by a very well respected cardiologist, was about Concepts of Pacing.  This lecture I understood without any difficulty at all, so that made me feel a lot better.  The last two lectures were on medications for CHF and ACS, and by then all the ritalin had worn off and I was mostly thinking about what I needed to do with the schedule.  Luckily, I sat through those two lectures last week.    I do have a couple more concepts in my head now than I used to.  Let's see what I've learned.  There are several kinds of heart block: 1st degree, second degree type one (Wenkebach or Mobitz I) and two (Mobitz II) and 3rd degree.  In first and second degree blocks it isn't actually a block as much as a delay in conduction.  We can see this in the length of the PR interval, which will be lengthened, indicating that the conduction from the SA node is taking longer to get where it needs to go.  In first degree block, the PR interval will be lengthened but constant.  In Wenkebach, the PR interval progressively lengthens from complex to complex until finally a beat gets dropped.  Then the pattern starts again.  This rhythm is also known as a grouping rhythm or steps in the snow and follows a pretty predictable pattern.  You might not catch this on a six second strip because of the nature of the rhythm.  I can't remember anything off the top of my head about Mobitz II.. but a third degree block is a true block, where the atria and ventricles are not communicating with each other.  This means you might have an atrial rate of say 90 and a ventricular rate of 40.  This requires pacing.  Other things I've learned today:  any time you have a rate of greater than 160 and a p wave, this is a supraventricular tachycardia.  The BNP, or b-naturetic peptide, is an indicator for congestive heart failure.  A level less than 100 indicates that it's probably not CHF, and a level greater than 400 indicates it probably is.  Inbetween levels can designate the severity of the failure.  BNP has an inherent diuretic effect and in synthetic form is given as Natrecor.  If you are going to draw a BNP on a patient on Natrecor, you have to d/c the drip two hours previous so you don't skew the results.  Symptoms of hyperkalemia include nausea, confusion, restlessness, and abdominal pain.    Don't you just love random regurgitation of facts like this?  Good grief.  Maybe I'm learning something after all.  I bet you didn't want to get a micro lecture in heart block today, but I figure, if I had to sit through it, so do you.  It'll come in time, I suppose.. it's sinking in little by little.  I also learned today that on a telemetry strip, you're essentially looking at what would be lead II on a 12 lead EKG.
