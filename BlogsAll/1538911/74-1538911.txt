         Well, I called the doctor's office and left a message this morning before I went to sleep and now I have an appointment for tomorrow.  Something has to be done about the hand.  That being said, I got a new HP Pavilion laptop (see below).  It has everything in it-an 80 gig hard drive, a 3.0 ghz pentium 4 processor, a DVD burner and anything else you can think of.  I know this seems excessive but I use the computer so much, I figure let me get as much as I can out of it.  I could have got a lot more memory and stuff for a bit less money but I really wanted the laptop, so I had to make some sacrifices.  It even has the wireless internet thingy so I can set the house up for that in the very near future.  I had a hard time making a decision about a computer.  Scott found this really sexy looking Sony Vaio that has a flip down keyboard and an enormous wide screen.  We almost got that one, but I couldn't adjust the keyboard any, and that would have caused a huge problem.  It took me almost an hour to make a decision.  And I've come to the conclusion that there is something about me that computer geek guys find very attractive.  I don't know what it is (it happens even when I am not buying something, so it isn't the commission) but I'm not sure if it's a compliment or not.  I think it might actually be not a good thing at all.  Anyway, the new laptop has a VERY cool touch screen mouse thing on it which makes it very easy for me to use.  I also got a wireless mouse but that will probably go with this desktop instead.  It will probably take me a couple of weeks to get everything moved over and arranged properly.  And it smokes Sim City 4.   All that being said, I have to work tonight and tomorrow twelves, then I have a class on Wednesday morning for two hours, and I am working an extra eight hours on Wednesday night.  It's gonna be a long week.  I'm just hoping that it's not so bad.  Gurudeva's sweater is at a bit of an impasse.  I made an error somewhere back there and I have a lot to rip out to get the pattern back where it belongs.          ');"> postCount(' ');
