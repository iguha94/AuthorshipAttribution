         Today I met a doctor at work who is of Punjabi origin.  She was very excited to meet me and instantly identified me as "a Hare Krishna".  Her family is Hindu and she personally is very devoted to Durga Ma.  I think she was very surprised to find me, just hanging out at the nurses station, but we had a very nice talk that ended with her saying that we should get together and have some kirtan and some bhajan and some lunch.. lol.. as if a resident has time for any of that, but I am hopeful that maybe we will.  At the very least, now one more person knows there are devotees of Krishna here.  Work is long-that whole 'twelve hours' thing is just propaganda.  It's more like fourteen.  Getting everything done in the time I have to do it (it's eight thirty now and I am cooking chickpeas to make chole for tomorrow's lunch) is pretty rough.  But I am working hard to keep everything in proper order, and leaving the rest of to Gurudeva and Krishna.  Jai Haribol!  Sri Sri Nitai Gaurachandra are the most beautiful and most merciful, and They smile down, refusing to see my millions of offenses and failures.  They are more merciful than I deserve, and I hope that someday I might be able to get just one drop of desire to serve Their lotus feet.    Email Me
