         Work is going to be rough this week.  I have to go in tonight and also sometime over the weekend.  We expect the state this coming week, so I don't anticipate getting any time off, and also working an enormous amount of hours.  Tuesday is Nirjala Ekadasi-total fast, even from water.  That will be a very big austerity with all the stress and pressure.  I am going to have to work very hard to keep focused on chanting and hearing, and make sure I have at least some time to either read or listen to a lecture every single day.  These are the special problems of being a householder-having to maintain a job and basically keep one foot in the material world to some degree while remaining focused on the spiritual.  Some days are harder than others, but every day is a motivator to get through school, and get into working from home.  It isn't that I don't like my job or the people I work with-I do-it's that I want to be home, in a controlled environment where I can regulate my time and ensure that I have time, energy, and interruption-free periods for worship.  I also think working from home will please my husband in that it will make it easier on me to keep up with housework and wifely things.  I am just hoping that it comes together financially to make it possible.
