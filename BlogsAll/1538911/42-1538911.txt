         So this is being typed very slowly.  I had quite the experience yesterday.  First, the OR nurse was very nice, but not a good stick.  I had to have 2 operational iv lines, 1 in eadh hand.  Then I got some antibiotics.  When it was time to go, they gave me a little Versed.  Not a lot.  So in the OR first thimg is the shot my hand full of lidocaine.  Now how is it that something that numbs you hurts so bad while it works.  It hurt like hell.  Then they take this big rubber band and wrap it around the hand moving back to the elbow, squeezing all the blood out, then they put on a tourniquet.  At this point he gave se some fentanyl and wooooooo out I went.  So I woke up before it was over, and i was watching the monitors.  I was breathing 10x a minute and my bp was 102/56.  You can't see them working because of how you are draped.  So I was trying to wiggle my fingers and couldn't and I was getting very restless so he said, "Wanna go back to sleep?" and I said yes and he gave me a little more fentanyl.  The anaesthesia was great, recovery was very fast.  I woke up with this enormous club of a bandage snd was getting dressed by 8:15.    Three of my fingers are still numb, which worries me, but otherwise it just hurts per normal.  On Monday they will take the club off.  I just took some more percocet, and I think I am going to get a snack.  Look, a lot of people visit this blog everyday, what is the matter with yall that only 1 person ever leaves a good word?
