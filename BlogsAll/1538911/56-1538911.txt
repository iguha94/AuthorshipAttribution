         I have   this  in my head.  It's a good commercial, yes, but two things.  1. When are they going to make a commercial like this for the girls?  and 2. I don't like waking up with it in my head.  I did not sleep very well today.  Last night was not so good.  Tonight pretty much has to be better because I am not sure how it oculd be very much worse.  Tomorrow I'm going to Hillsborough, which will be wonderful, a micro-vacation for me, but I'm just hoping I can stay awake long enough to get myself there in one piece.  I am debating about which way to go and how to time it, because it'll be a Monday which means Raleigh Durham traffic, and I don't want any part of that.  We'll see how I feel in the morning and go from there.  I haven't even packed yet, but really, how much do I need?  Anyway, if I can't get that   commercial  out of my head, it might be better to just drive off the road.  Not to mention that Scott sings it just perfectly and does so frequently.  Really, what is the point?  What are we saying here?  What is it that guys want anyway?  I'm not exactly sure.  I don't know that the commercial was designed to stand up to this kind of sociological scrutiny.  Anyway, it's funny but on the other hand, on a deeper level, it's kind of disturbing, because it leaves me wondering, what exactly is it that you want/expect, and is whatever that is something I'm okay with, and if I'm not okay with it, then is it my problem, your problem, a sociocultural problem, or should we just have another beer and forget it.    I told you, I'm not expressing myself well today.  I know what I'm trying to say, but it's just not coming out the way I want it to.   ');"> postCount(' ');
