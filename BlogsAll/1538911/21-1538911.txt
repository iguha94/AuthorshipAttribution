         We are back from New York.  I didn't do a single thing I had planned to do but we had a nice time anyway.  We stayed at Scott's mom's house and met her boyfriend (Scott's father left his body in 2003 after a long bout with cancer).  He seems very nice and they seem to be very happy together.  We drove around a LOT and saw all the old neighbourhoods.  Not very far from my house we saw a flock of wild turkeys, which was a first for me-in all the years I lived there, I never saw such a thing.  The lake didn't look very good.  We went up to Cold Spring and took some nice pictures.  I am hoping to get them developed tomorrow.  We also went to Norwalk to the aquarium there.    The weather was cold (in the 50's) and raining most of the week.  I had to buy a jacket because I was freezing half to death.  Every morning I got up and chanted japa on the front porch.  The first morning I locked myself out and was out there from about 4:30 to 7.  It was very cold.  We finally told Scott's mom about me being a devotee.  I gave her a copy of The Higher Taste and a nice Gita, and she read the mahamantra (aloud) off my beadbag.  So Jai!  In that respect it was very good.  I am also going to send a cookbook and possibly a Gita to Don's granddaughter Krystle as well.  On the way home we got confused and made a wrong turn that took us about 100 miles out of our way, so we are really tired tonight and won't do much of anything but get some rest.
