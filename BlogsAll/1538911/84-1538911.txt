         So the speakers are still really new and we are still in the phase of re-listening to everything we own to see how much better it sounds on the new setup than it did on the old.  Okay, he's right.  They DO sound better.  But he pointed something out that sort of made me sit back and realise how old we are.  There we were, listening to King Crimson's 'In The Court of The Crimson King', which was released, incidentally, the year after I was born.  (For those of you with math skills like mine, that means it's 35 years old.)  Anyway, besides the fact that we even know that such an album exists, I happened to call it an 'album'.  I didn't know that people don't call albums albums anymore.  Now they just call them CDs.  Like (according to Scott) a kid would never say something like, 'Oh, Limp Bizkit has a new album out.'  They'd say, 'Oh, Limp Bizkit has a new CD out.'    It made me feel so old, you know?  My terminology is becoming obsolete.  I'm going to go the way of Betamax.  It kind of made me realise we're really getting old.  Of course, it didn't help that in Best Buy tonight I got '70's Hits'.  Do you know I know all the words to 'The Night Chicago Died'?  In the car on the way home I was singing 'One Toke Over The Line'.  Does anyone besides me even remember that song?  The whole thing with old music is that it brings back memories to you.  The sound quality isn't really as important to me as the nostalgia factor.  For example, about ten years ago (almost) when I was in nursing school, it was my last week of clinicals and we were in PCU (at that time, it was called Post Intensive Care Unit or ICU Stepdown).  My clinical instructor, Regina, and I were in the hallway discussing my patient.  In retrospect, it seems like just about every patient I got throughout all of nursing school was essentially the same-just about to peak in the DTs.  (As a side note, do you know what the DTs are?  This is 'delirium tremens'.. which is basically what happens when someone has been drunk for way too long and suddenly stops-alcohol withdrawal.  They go through the whole nine yards of hallucinations, combativeness, pukeyness, sometimes seizures, and then an amazing case of obnoxious as the alcohol begins to fade and you see the personality underneath.  I can say this.  I've been through the DTs twice, and neither time with the luxury of a hospital bed.  Digression over.)  Anyway, so we were out there discussing it, and she said, 'Okay look.  What you've basically got going on here is a guy who's one toke over the line.'  With perfect timing we both broke out in song and we sang it straight through without stopping before almost collapsing in hysterics.  I don't know, maybe you had to be there, but it's become a benchmark for me.  Anyway, I sang it all the way home and it brought back fond memories of nursing school.  And ever since then, too, bringing people through the DTs has been one of my very favourite things to do as a nurse.  Most nurses wouldn't want to touch that sort of thing with a ten foot pole, but I've always gotten a kick out of it.  But I have limits, too.  The minute they get sober, in my mind it becomes psych nursing, and I'm done.  I don't want anything to do with it once they can make complete oriented sentences.  It's the whole hallucinations and locked leather restraints part with librium and ativan that I get a kick out of.  Isn't nursing grand!          ');"> postCount(' ');
