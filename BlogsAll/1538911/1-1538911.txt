         I am not feeling very well today so I haven't done much.    One of the things I do to help promote some interest in a group here in Wilmington is distribute flyers.  I printed them up myself and had copies made, and at night, when I go out for japa walks, I distribute them in mailboxes.  It's a numbers game, really-all marketing is, so if I get one or two website hits out of it, I feel like I'm doing well.  Spoke to Rangadevi at New Goloka about the webcam idea.  I need to contact another devotee up there to talk about it, and see how much it will all cost.  It will really depend on what kind of setup they want.  I could buy a whole wireless cam setup for about $120 complete, with two cameras, but if they want one really nice cam, it will cost a lot more, and I won't be able to afford the whole thing.  We will have to see.  I've started doing some reading for school, but being as uncomfortable as I am today, I can't really concentrate, and so a lot of it is just not sinking in.  I am hoping to feel better tomorrow.  I   have  to go to work, so all I can hope is that I feel decent.  Today it feels like I have a bowling ball rolling around in my gut.  This hasn't happened in a long time, to be honest, and really I ought to be glad, but at the same time, it's miserable.  It's been raining off and on, and the humidity is about 180% even when the rain stops (actual humidity 83%-air temp 73F, heat index 84F) so it's miserable outside too.  All you can really do is stay inside and read and chant.  This weekend they are playing nonstop Bugs Bunny cartoons on Boomerang, but we only have one TV and Scott gets tired of that PDQ.  So I am reading and chanting and intermittently dozing between doses of Motrin.  I hope I feel better soon.
