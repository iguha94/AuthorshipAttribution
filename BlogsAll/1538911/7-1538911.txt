         No ranting today.  Promise.  I feel very strongly the seperation from the devotees and the Deities in Hillsborough.  I often think to myself that my life would be so much better and happier if we lived there.  But there must be a reason for us to be here.  Krsna doesn't make mistakes.  So I will try and carry on, and hope that I can bring myself to a point of being qualified to live in the association of devotees.  Because of all the work we've been doing in remodeling the house, I haven't been up to Hillsborough in over a month.  Hopefully soon I will be able to get up there, and if all goes well, Jagannath prabhu will be setting up a web-cam system like they have in LA, and I'll be able to see the Deities every morning.  That will be wonderful.  Eventually maybe we can get an audio system as well, and I'll be able to hear lectures and everything even when I'm not able to be there.    I often wonder at the mercy I've received.  I've done so many things in my life I am not proud of, and made so many mistakes, and still continue to make mistakes every  day out of my foolish ignorance and pride, and yet I've been given this chance to take a step towards coming to Krsna and Radharani's lotus feet.  It's amazing to me-I have this sense of being so utterly unqualified.  I don't want to question it, but it seems almost unbelievable at times.  How on earth did this happen?  So I want to try hard to somehow work towards being a little bit worthy.  If I can just get one drop of taste for chanting, this whole lifetime will be perfect-so I am praying for blessings and the mercy to keep going, even though sometimes I feel so alone and far away.  Srila Prabhupada and Gurudeva are always watching and caring for all of us, and with their blessings, everything will fall into place.
