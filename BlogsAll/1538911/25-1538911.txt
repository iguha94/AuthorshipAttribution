         Just to keep you up to date: yesterday was OK.  In the interest of being unbiased and fair in my reporting, the hospital seems  to have really taken a different attitude from the time I left.  The 'magnet status' thing seems to be the real deal, and not just a PR trick.  They honestly do seem to be much more nurse-friendly than they were when I was here last.  In particular I am impressed with the very thorough orientation plans.  So many things have changed in the last five years that I feel like I'm waking up from a coma.  They don't use demerol anymore.  I have a lot to relearn.  In other news, today I am going to find the Padayatris.  I have only the vaguest notion of where they are, but I'm going to get dressed, get in the car, and head out there to see if I can't find them.  My plan is to make a huge circle from here probably all the way up to Clinton and then come across 24 to 242, and then down to Elizabethtown.  If I don't find them today, I'll find them tomorrow.  Either way the weekend isn't ending without me finding the Padayatris.  I have Monday off-if I need that as well, I'll do it.  I have money for gas, and I went and got them some dal, turmeric, a bag of basmati, two jars of hing, and I will stop and get some carrots for the horses and one of th ose little disposable cameras that I like.  I am hoping to be back later online documenting my visit with them.   Hare Krishna!   Email Me
