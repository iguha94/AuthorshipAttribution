         So, I'm still awake... I went to Walmart after leaving work at 4:30 and spent some time there just wandering about.  I bought some floor pillows for in front of the altar and a nice round pan/tray to bathe the Deities in, and some picture frames for pictures of Srila Prabhupada that I've recently purchased, and a bunch of other miscellaneous stuff.  I thought about going to the beach to walk and watch the sunrise, but the humidity is like 99.5% and it's very sticky outside.  I don't feel as bad as I  should  having gone all this time with no sleep, but I am sure that at some future moment forthcoming I will just crash.    I have really been enjoying the   live audio/video from ISKCON Los Angeles.   In fact, I've been enjoying it so much that I would like to set up something similar at New Goloka.  Simpler, at least to start-streaming audio would make it more complicated, so I'm thinking maybe two wireless cameras and a receiver.  I wrote a letter to one of the devotees there to just see if it might be feasible.  I get such seperation from Radha Golokananda.  The LA temple seems very opulent and beautiful, but I really like the intimacy and sweetness of New Goloka.  I don't think I could ever really be as happy anywhere else.  I hope that when the new temple is built, even though it will be bigger, it retains that sense of closeness and personal attention.  I'm sure it's really nice to have a big opulent place-the gift shop in LA looks enormous itself!-but for me, I think I prefer something smaller.    So hopefully my book will arrive for school today and I will finally be able to get started.  I am so ready to get on it and get over it and get along with it.  My goal date is still September 30.. for now..
