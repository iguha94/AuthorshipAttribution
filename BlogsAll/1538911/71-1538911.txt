         Every day on my way home I drive past   this place .  It makes me laugh every time.  Their website isn't very good, but if you look carefully, you'll see the name of the cigarettes they sell are Grim Reapers.  They even have a picture of Himself there on the pack.  This cracks me up.  Some people are offended by it.  The guys at the company (I know one of them, not very well, but we had a conversation one day), say, 'Hey, we ain't lying..'  Castle Hayne, NC, is a very, very small town.  This place is literally like a barn in a field.  Out front they have this UPS truck painted black with a huge Reaper on the side, and it says POISON INC and there's a flashing sign that says POISON.  I don't know, maybe I'm twisted.. I think it's so funny.  Every day it makes me smile at the irony of it all.  Everything should have such truth in advertising.  It would be like naming your malt whiskey "CIRRHOSIS INC".  How come everyone beats on the tobacco industry while Budweiser is out making cute commercials?  I don't get that bias, but that's another story.  I've just been meaning to share this website with yall for a long time, and so I'm doing it today.          ');"> postCount(' ');
