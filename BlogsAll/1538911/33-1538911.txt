         While at   work   today, I got a part time job.  Yeah, I know that sounds crazy.  I'm leaving details out til it's in cold cash.  Meanwhile, the hours are long and hard.  I am back to wearing a   cap.   Because Regents never designated a cap, we got to pick one out.  What fun that was!  The one I chose is   here.   The number is #7014.  Trust me, it's cuter in person.  Today's most frequent comment was: Aren't you CUTE!  Well, yeah.  But I think nurses ought to wear caps.  The reason is that patients love it.  They want us to look like Florence.  For me, that's enough reason.  (Although having it be cute helps.)  When you wear a cap, you look professional, you look traditional, and people know you're a nurse.  They like that.  I am going back to all dresses too-right now some people in Israel are working on making me some nice jumpers that you can't read the newspaper through.  I am also going to get some patterns for some nice modest dresses (I will talk more on modesty later) and make myself some nice white dresses for work.  (Hint: if you make them long enough, you don't need to wear pantyhose.)  I like being a nurse, but I also like dressing up like one.  I like to look feminine and pretty and old fashioned.  And my patients like it too.  So can anyone come up with a reason for me NOT to wear a cap?  (Hint:  talking to me about infection control doesn't work.  I don't work in the operating room.)  I think all nurses ought to wear their caps.  We worked hard enough for it-why not show it off?   Email Me
