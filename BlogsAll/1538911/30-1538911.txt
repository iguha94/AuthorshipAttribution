         I promise, every day's getting better.  By next week things should be back to normal.  It hasn't been easy-but then again, the road to Braj, as I put in big letters up top there, is strewn with thorns.  And sometimes it feels like it's all thorns and no road.  So this is part of the process: keeping on when it seems like everything's going against you.  We are all so conditioned, for millions of lifetimes, again and again, to this material nature.  It's so hard to keep yourself straight.  The aspiration is there-we want to keep going on the road, to keep walking the straight path-but this material conditioning is very strong.  Imagine breaking a habit you've had for millions of lifetimes-not years, lifetimes.  So that's our challenge.  And through the mercy of Sri Guru and Srila Prabhupada, and all the Vaisnav devotees, we can take that challenge and walk on that path.  But that doesn't mean we don't stumble or don't fall, ever.  So then the challenge becomes how to keep going-how to get up, how to keep walking on this thorny road. So we support each other, and look to each other for mercy and understanding, and prayers.  The prayers of the Vaisnavas are very powerful!  It is only through the mercy of the devotees that we become Krishna conscious at all.  So it's a wonderful thing, that we have each other to turn to.   Lord Nrsingadev is very powerful, and has the strength to conquer anything.  My little problems and miseries are nothing in His hands.  He can do it all through His mercy and His power.  Jai Nrsingadev!  Please have mercy on me and let me take shelter of Your lotus feet, and keep me safe, even from my own self and my own material nature.   Email Me
