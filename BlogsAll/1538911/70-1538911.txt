         It's a nasty, cold, rainy day.  The pixie to the right there is dead wrong.  I made some corn chowder this morning (mmm) for breakfast and it was just what I wanted.    Today's agenda is mostly focusing on my office and trying to get it a little bit straightened up.  I am not a very neat or organised person (ADHD) and sometimes it seems like no matter how much I'd LIKE to be neat and organised, I just can't be.  But I am going through stuff today and trying to get cleaned up a little bit.  Besides that, I have some laundry to put up.    The incision on my hand is looking less red and inflamed than it was.  At one point I was getting convinced I had an infection (and no, I am not a hypochondriac, because a couple of other people said the same thing).  The thumb really isn't any better.  I have to call Dr. Scully's office today.  That reminds me!  I am supposed to call Kelly The Benefits Girl.  I've been meaning to do this for like a week now and somehow I've just managed to consistently forget.  Also, I need to get a look at my schedule for next week.  Gaura Purnima is coming up, and I know I made some adjustments to my schedule to get some extra days off, but because it's out of my regular routine, I can't remember what days I'm supposed to work.  Honestly, and I mean this.. I am not as stupid as I sometimes sound.  I better go make these phone calls before I forget again.  ***And as a further update:  Scully thinks I am doing too much with the hand.  He wants me to splint it and rest it.  That's not really very practical being that I have to work.  Hopefully it will back off soon and I can just get on with things.  It's starting to get very depressing, and I don't like this at all.          ');"> postCount(' ');
