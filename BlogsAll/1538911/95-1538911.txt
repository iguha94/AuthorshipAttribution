         I've been whining for days now about how I haven't been sleeping.  Well it happened again last night, and out of sheer desperation I decided to take some medicine that the doctor had given me to help me with sleeping.  It worked for about three hours, and then I was back up again, knitting away on Gurudeva's sweater (I have the pattern worked out.  Now it's just a matter of pacing it so my hand can handle it.)  So finally I went back to bed around four, and of course my husband left for work at seven.    Well, the medication must have been time release!  I could not get my eyes open for more than ten seconds the whole rest of the day!  I have just now FORCED myself to get out of the bed, and believe me, I could go get back in it and sleep.  I can't stand it!  I go days and days without sleeping and then finally when I take something to help me sleep, it doesn't work until morning.   It's like a big joke, on me.  Anyway.
