         I go back to work on Tuesday.  I slept through the night.  For the first time since I've been off work.  Remember I said I wanted to have a garden once we moved?   Well,   check this out .  I decided to give it a try and see what happens.  I am a tomato nut, so theoretically this thing could pay for itself just in tomatoes.  I ordered three, so that I can plant tomatoes, cucumbers, and corn.  These are the three vegetables we eat most in the summer, and if they perform anything like the pictures they have on the website, we'll have enough not only for us but also to share.  So I'm pretty excited.  It looks simple enough, but everything looks simple when they want you to buy.  If they do work well, I'll probably order another three and then if I install some plant lights I could conceivably grow year round.  Just planting carefully you can grow ten months out of the year here, because you've got cool weather stuff like peas and lettuce that can be planted in September and February.  Collards don't even get good until after the frost-not that I would plant collards.  I don't mind them, but I wouldn't want bushels of them.  But quite a few things grow in cooler weather, like cauliflower and stuff.  And if these things work great, then I won't need a garden, just a greenhouse.  It will be pretty amazing if I can grow corn in a box like that.  We'll see how it goes.  Last year I planted some Anaheim chiles that grew really, really well.  I was very impressed.  It was actually more than I could use.  If I have that 'problem' this year, I'll just have to buy a dehydrator and dry everything.  Most of all I like my fruit trees, but the only ones that have been consistently good are my apples.  I don't think the peach and nectarine are making it through the winter, and the fire ants ate one of my plums.  If I plant more trees, it would probably be figs.  And I've got a grapevine, which will probably start doing something this year, since it's been in a year now.  Scott got three of his new speakers today.  I must admit they do sound better than the old ones, but the old ones were good too.  This is his thing.    Very shortly I am going to be completely decimating my office here.  I need a new (lower) surface for typing/mousing because of my wrist, so Scott is going to build one.  I told him it doesn't matter what it looks like, so he can build it out of scraps or whatever.  I think he said white melamine.  So once that happens, just about everything in this room is going to get tossed out and the whole room redone.  It probably could use painting but I've got so much stuff up on the walls that it almost isn't worth patching until we're ready to move, so I will probably wait on that.  I am not really a very neat person so he will be very happy to have me tear this room out and start over.  He said in the new house I get one room to be messy in.  Maybe it should be a shed in the back yard. :)            ');"> postCount(' ');
