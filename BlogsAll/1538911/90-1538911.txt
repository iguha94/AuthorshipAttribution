         Last Valentine's day weekend my friend Anne and I took off and drove to NYC.  This was quite an adventure.  Luckily for posterity we videotaped the whole thing and called it Two Fat Women in A Jeep.  Unfortunately, I don't know where the video is now.  I think she's got it.  Anyway, the first thing you have to understand is the transportation issue.  We live in Wilmington, NC, which is roughly 710 miles from NYC.  I don't drive on interstates if I can help it, and I am positively phobic about i-95, so whenever I go to NY, I drive up 17.  Now most people think this takes a lot longer, but it actually doesn't, and the increased safety factor from having me not be out of my mind scared really makes a difference.  The third factor besides distance and driving idiosyncracies is the fact that I drive a 1995 Jeep Wrangler, which has never been classed in a 'luxury vehicle' category.  So originally we had decided to go on January 23, but we had a huge storm here with a total snow accumulation of four inches (you should have heard the guy in the Tarrytown Hilton when I was cancelling our reservations due to "snowstorm").  Seriously this was a bad storm here and work (at the time was the nursing home-Anne still works there) would not let us leave town.  Yes, they can do that when you're in admin.  So we had cancelled and rescheduled for Valentine's day weekend.  We left Thursday night around 7PM.  I always like to drive up at night and back during the day to put me in daylight on the most unfamiliar section of the drive.  I've driven it so many times it's kind of a science, and I know exactly where I ought to be when (ie., if I leave here at 8, I should be at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel at 1AM.  This may seem excessively anal, but it's all very carefully planned to keep me out of rush hour traffic on the turnpike and heading into the city.  So merrily we go.  The first problem is that Anne has to pee about every 6.4 miles.  She's a much more leisurely type than I am-I tend to be a bit more torqued on average, and the half-hour stops had me worn to ribbons before we ever hit the NC/VA border.  I am one of those nurses that can go all night without ever stopping for the bathroom (she is one of those nurses that has done that so long it doesn't work anymore) and so by the time we got to the Bridge Tunnel she was grabbing the cell phone and calling local urologists to set me up for emergency dialysis.  We drove pretty steady through the night.  She slept most of the way through Virginia and Maryland, and then we came across the scene of a train wreck with a huge accompanying fire that detoured us through the back woods of Delaware for a while.  It didn't knock us too much off schedule despite everything and we were on the NJ Turnpike by 7.  At this point I had to sleep so we stopped at that Molly Pitcher stop or which ever is the last/first stop on the turnpike, got gas, ate some breakfast, I finally went to the bathroom and I fell asleep for (she says) literally four minutes.  The sun was shining but it was amazingly cold, so we decided to get on with it since we were practically there.  I was born in Inwood, which is way up on the west side (200 st) of Manhattan, and we lived there til I was about 6, at which time we moved "Upstate" to Putnam County.  At the time it was a wilderness-dirt roads, four digit phone numbers, and the nearest stoplight to our house was ten miles away.  It's still pretty rural, but nothing like it was.  I lived there til 1993, after we got married, and moved down here.  Point being, I knew where we were going and so on, so it wasn't exactly like being tourists.  Anyway, we stopped on the Palisades and called work (it was now 9AM) and let everyone know we were okay.  The river was iced up pretty good and I could NOT believe how cold it was.  You really do get thin blood or something when you live in a warm climate.  Then we crossed the Bear Mountain Bridge, and since we couldn't go to the hotel til that afternoon, we drove around to look at everything for a while.  We spent the day just wandering about, stopped at had lunch at the Olympic Diner in Mahopac, and got hard rolls, black and whites, and a couple of Double Temptation cakes at the Homestyle Bakery in Peekskill.  There are no diners in NC.  I'm not sure why. The diner was/is an institution in New York.  You also can't get a hard roll here.  I just two weeks ago found a place that makes black and whites.  It was an ephemeral moment.  So we stayed at the Tarrytown Hilton, which is remarkably well placed right there at the Tappan Zee bridge.  I decided it was a good place to stay because it was so convenient to Metro north and to the bridge and also because it was really cheap.  There is also a very nice diner (see) across the street called the Eldorado, where we ate supper every night.  The following morning we got on the train and headed to the city.  It was unbelievably cold.  Anne is one of those very friendly southern people who likes to tell people she's from NC and has never been here before.  This sort of sent me into fits, but trying to get her to do anything is vaguely like trying to herd cats-it doesn't work.  So I resigned myself to being labeled a tourist for the whole trip.  We were also surprised to find out that this was the weekend of the big anti-Iraq-war peace rally.  We met several demonstrators and did a very nice interview with them on video for our 'documentary'.  Once we got to the city, the plan was to go to Ground Zero via the East Village.  Yes, I know what you're thinking.  Why on earth would we do that?  Because there were places I wanted to go to.  And we were walking, which is really the only way to see the city.  If you aren't familiar with Manhattan, our route covered about 85 blocks, which is by any standard, a very long walk (miles).    We started off down Madison avenue.  At 31 St we found a man laying half on the sidewalk and half on the gutter.  We, good nurses that we are, ran (trundled.  We were dressed like the Michelin Man.) over to him and asked him what was wrong.  He opened his eyes and gave us his name, then said "I'm HIV positive.  I need an ambulance."  (You see how I'm HIPPA conscious, don't you?)  Of course he needed an ambulance. His eyeballs were totally pinpointed.  I don't know how much heroin he did that morning, but quite a lot, and so we hung out and waited til the ambulances showed up, threw our coats over him and so on.  The guy was dressed for a summer day.  It took about 30 minutes for the ambulances to get there.  Lots of people were hanging out of cabs telling us they had called 911 on their cell phones for us.  From there we carried on down to 23 St, watching the riot police come storming in by the busloads to quell the peaceful protest.  There were helicopters overhead and everything-nobody was fooling around.  Once we got there we turned east and headed over to Stuyvesant, and then went downtown past Beth Israel hospital, and over again to Avenue A and Tompkins Square Park.  This isn't the greatest of all neighbourhoods but it was important to me to go there.  This was the first place outside of India that anyone publicly chanted Hare Krishna.  When Srila Prabhupada first came here, this is where he went to hold the first harinam sankirtan.  There is a big elm tree there where he sat, and a plaque commemorating it.  It was kind of an emotional experience for me and I chanted a little bit there.  I wish it hadn't been so cold.  From there, Anne wanted to eat, so we turned onto St. Mark's and I got some lunch from a place called Vegetarian Kitchen and she got a hotdog from a place across the street called Eat Me.  (Only in NYC.)    We warmed up some and then we kept going west on St. Mark's to 2nd Avenue and turned south there.  We walked all the way down to the very end, Houston/Lafayette, that area.  Gosh it's not so good there, or wasn't last year.  We went to the temple there at 26 2nd Avenue.  This was the first temple ever in the United States and where everything  began.  I took some pictures and offered obesiances while Anne went and found a bathroom (again).    Once we left there we headed towards Chinatown.  Over on Grand Street we found a Thai restaurant called Thai Angel and she wanted to have some tea so we stopped and got warm.  We were getting pretty tired at this point.  We had tea and appetizers (very nice fried tofu and taro), and then we set off again west.  We had a good time looking over everything for sale on the street.  I bought a hat because she was wearing mine and it was way too cold to not have a hat.  It's an ugly hat but everyone was wearing one just like it, so I felt okay about being unfashionable.  There was so much stuff for sale and even though it's all just overpriced junk, it's still fun to look.  We walked around there for a while and then finally, headed off down Church St to Ground Zero.  There was (I don't know if it's still there or not) a huge shrine across the street.  People from all over the country and the world had left things, messages, shirts, flags, etc.  It was very poignant to see.  The whole area was quite crowded but very silent, and the atmosphere was very like a church.  The site itself wasn't much-by now most of the mess had been taken care of and all it was, was a huge empty hole.  It was weird to me to see things (like a church not far away) that I recognised from pictures that had been on the internet after everything happened.  On the chainlink surround of the site were several large plaques that had all the victims' names listed (something like at the Vietnam memorial).  There was a man playing 'America the Beautiful' on a flute, which made everything just a little bit eerie.  If I hadn't been so incredibly exhausted by that point I think I could have appreciated it more.  We stayed for a little while and then headed home on the train.  I love Grand Central Station.  We managed to catch an earlier train than we had originally thought and got home at a very decent hour.  The following morning we were going to leave at 8 but you can't do anything on time with Anne, so at 10AM we were out buying bagels and coffee getting ready to leave.  The cellphone rang and it was my husband letting us know that there was a blizzard heading directly towards us and to get the hell out of there.  Naturally this came as a complete surprise to us (I don't watch the news, not even in NY) and so we got in the car and got going.  By the time we got to exit 7 on the turnpike, we were seeing little snow bunnies swirling on the roat.  At exit 5 it was snowing good, and at exit 3 it was just about whiteout.  We were driving so slow I was able to take pictures, and Anne was videotaping.  On the video you can hear on the radio that the whole state of Delaware had just shut down.  We decided after some argument to go on 17.  This was upheld by my husband who said the weather would be worse inland.    For the next 300+ miles we drove 35 miles an hour.  We had to stop several times to get the ice off the windshield wipers, and it was a good thing we had the Jeep because we had to climb snowdrifts to get to gas stations.  Why didn't we stop?  Because we didn't really have any money, and all we had to eat were hard rolls, bagels, black and whites and two Double Temptation cakes.  So we carried on, finding outhouses when necessary, and all the while in the back of my mind was the thought that the bridge tunnel might be closed.  We were practically delirious by the time the snow turned to rain (in southern Virginia).  When we stopped in Virginia Beach at Denny's (after 9PM) we were laughing so hard at stupid things (don't make me tell you about the Thyroid Family) that we about choked on our supper.    We finally got home at 4AM.  My knee was so locked up that I actually fell over when I got out of the car.  I had to walk around for 10-15 minutes before I got back in the car (we were at work).  We left a note saying we had just got in and would not be in that day (Monday.. remember, we left on Thursday).  By the time I got home, got unpacked and unwound enough to get in the bed, it was about 8AM.  The phone rang at 8:30 to let me know the state had showed up and I had to go to work.  I don't know why to this day they made us come in, but you can add it to the list of reasons I don't work there anymore.  We're planning on going back, maybe in May, for a long weekend again, and we've also planned a trip to Charleston (neither of us have ever been there).  But this time we're taking Anne's Explorer.  It doesn't come out as funny in print as it was in life, but the next time we go I'll have audio blog posting so you can share in the joy.  Have a good day.  Chant Hare Krishna.
