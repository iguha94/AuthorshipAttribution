         Every day I   have darshan  of Sri Sri Radha Golokananda online.  Radha-Golokananda are the presiding Deities of New Goloka up in Hillsborough.  It occurs to me, judging from comments people have made to me and questions people have asked, and even my own personal experience from when I was just learning about Krishna consciousness, that when you look at the forms (murtis) of the Deities from a material standpoint, you can get confused, and think They are just made of marble or brass or whatever, like dolls or statues.  But in reality They are not.  When you can begin to understand that the Lord actually comes in the form of the Deity to allow us to offer some service personally to Him, and you begin to try to approach Krishna and Radharani to develop a relationship with Them, then you can see for yourself that They are very much present and very much reciprocating with Their devotees.  Everyday, when I take darshan, and I see Them dressed so beautifully in Their night and day outfits, I think to myself, who couldn't love Them?  They are so beautiful and full of mercy, smiling at us.  Their mood is sweet and playful.  So as you come to guru and learn from him, and through him begin to take a step towards Krishna and Radharani's lotus feet, then you can begin to get a glimpse of the reality, and see past just the material vision of what looks to you like two statues.  There's so much more there, but you have to have the eyes to see it.  There are many accounts where Krishna has spoken to His devotees, and even travelled on foot across India to bear witness to an oath, when His devotee was going to be cheated.  The burden is on us, not on Him-when we can become pure enough, we can become qualified to engage in this sort of dealing with Krishna.  For now we have to try to elevate ourselves from this material mud.
