         Oh did I ever sleep good today.  Can you believe it?  I've been assigned to a class tomorrow from noon-2, so I got taken off tomorrow night's schedule.  This isn't as bad as it sounds, because then I work tonight, class tomorrow, off Thursday, class Friday, work Saturday Sunday 12s and then an 8 on Monday.  Oh yeah, the life of a nurse.  Coordinator, no less.  Doesn't it make you want to be me?  Our dog, Bree (short for Aubrey Rose) is a chow/pit mix (are you cringing?) that we rescued back in 98.  She had a broken leg and they would have put her down if we hadn't claimed her.  So she was just a baby (4 mos) and so we had the surgery done and all.  Anyway, at the time we had cats, but they've been gone now for a couple of years and she is very firmly established as The Dog of the House.  She loves people.  All people, any people.  People who want to break in, I'm sure, she would welcome with open paws.  But she hates animals.  And insects.  Birds.  Frogs.  Anything non-human that moves.  Very territorial, she is.  Anyway, the people nextdoor have this black cat, probably not even six months old now, that got in our backyard and was sitting outside our back door.  The dog went nuts, and so after a minute of trying to shoo the cat away, we figured, okay, let's let her have at it.  Well, she went nuts chasin the cat across the yard.  The cat thought it could get out through the fence (major misjudgement) but couldn't, so they went around and around for about 15 seconds and then the cat took off and got over the fence before my lil watchdog could get to her.  Was this mean?  You shoulda seen her with every bit of fur on her whole body all sticking straight up like she was somebody.  And that kink in her tail was so tight it had to hurt.  She was like, Look at me! Look at me! Look what I did!  Normally she does 'perimeter patrols' around the fence every time she's outside.  Now she's got her nose stuffed up against the door trying to get a whiff of that cat.  I got a feeling she's just dying for that cat to try coming in our yard again.    Don't worry, I wouldn't have let her kill the cat or anything.  Bree's got a bad leg.  She's not all that fast, and the backyard is uneven, so she hops-the one leg is 2" shorter than the others.  I just wanted her to feel fulfilled in her role as a protector and guardian.  Let her earn that spot on my pillow, you know?  At least we know what she'll be dreaming about when she's barking in her sleep tonight.  Yall have a good night.  I'm gonna go take on   New Hanover .          ');"> postCount(' ');
