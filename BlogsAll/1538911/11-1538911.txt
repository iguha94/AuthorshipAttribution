         Janmastami is this week coming!  I always love to go up and spend several days at the temple.  What is even bigger for me (this year) is that we will be in New York for Radhastami.  I am planning on going to Second Avenue that day.  I hope to find out if anything is planned.  Since I've never been to Brooklyn (does that surprise you from a native New Yorker? Some people never leave their block, never mind their borough!) I don't feel very comfortable taking myself out to the Brooklyn temple alone.  Perhaps another time-maybe if Anne and I go back to New York again, we can spend a day going out there.  I have heard it is very beautiful-but since I have no idea how the trains run there or even where it is or what kind of neighbourhood it's in, I just wouldn't feel very safe.  Second Avenue is not a very good neighbourhood, but I will be there in the daytime, and I tend to always feel relatively comfortable no matter where I am in Manhattan.  I am hoping on getting involved in the Bhakti Vrksa program when I am up in Hillsborough.   I'll be there for five days this year, which is more than last year and a very welcome retreat for me spiritually.  I love Janmastami.  It is so much fun and excitement.  I'm just hoping it isn't too hot, and that maybe it doesn't rain  quite  as hard as it did last year.
