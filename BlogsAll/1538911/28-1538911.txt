         Went over to the hospital today to do the whole pre-employment health thing.  Was reminded why I was so happy when I left.  It doesn't matter.  What's important is that this job is going to give me the time to preach and be in the community doing devotional service, and that the income generated by this job is going to pay off our bills and get us up to Hillsborough.  It's so easy to fall into that 'me me me' thing.  It doesn't take a lot of effort to get back into it.  I have to continually remind myself-as sorry as I am to have to admit that-that this job isn't about ME.. it's not about what I WANT.. it's about advancing my Gurudeva's mission, and Srila Prabhupada's mission, and ultimately Lord Caitanya's sankirtan movement.  It hasn't got anything to do with me.  We have to accept those things favourable, and reject that which is unfavourable.  This does not mean 'accept those things I want and reject those things I don't want'.  It means what it says.  As it is.  I went and picked up my check today.  Already it seems like things are not doing well.  There's a lot of tension over there.  The weather has been marvelous.  I am very excited about the opportunity to do a little preaching via email.  It's totally enlivening and encouraging to be able to help someone with questions about Krishna consciousness.  It's really what makes all this worthwhile.      Email Me
