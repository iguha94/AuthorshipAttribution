         When I go to the temple, there are all different kinds of people there. You find Bengalis, South Indians, people from Finland, Estonia, Mexico, Russia, Nigeria, the US, Croatia, Slovenia, Japan, France, Canada and probably more that I can't pull up off the top of my head. This is at New Goloka, which is a very, very small community by ISKCON standards.  Although I sometimes have difficulty communicating with some of the devotees there because of language barriers, we all come together and chant. It reminds me in a way of how the Catholic church spread all over the world and the Latin language was able to bring cultures and peoples together. I went to an Easter service in a Catholic church in Spain. Although the rules were slightly different (we had to cover our heads, wear dresses, and have long sleeves), it was still the same Mass, and although I didn't understand the sermon because it was in Spanish, I had no trouble following the Mass, which was in Latin.  Krishna consciousness isn't about being Indian or looking Indian or adopting Indian customs or culture. Srila Prabhupada likened traditional Indian dress to a uniform of a policeman or doctor. In the west, especially, we stand out because of how we dress. The idea behind it is that people would look at you and know you're a devotee. It's not mandatory by any means and it doesn't make you a devotee.  The principles behind Krishna consciousness are essentially the same as most of the world's major religions: learn to love God and to serve Him. I think it's very significant that in most pictures I've seen of Krishna, He's not black, but blue. Blue is a colour you won't find (in health) on any person on this planet. Therefore it becomes a little harder to be prejudiced or to make material designations. It's not like we're saying Krishna is white like a white person or black like a black person or red or yellow or whatever-He's blue. There's no race that can claim to be blue. I'm not exactly expressing myself well on this point, but maybe you will understand what I mean.  So the goal is loving God and serving God. Whatever means we use to achieve this, the goal is still the same. I never really try to convert people or convince them that I'm right and they're not. I give out an awful lot of information, period. But if people are Baptist, or Pentecostal, or Amish, or Jewish, or Muslim, or whatever, if their practice is bringing them to a point of loving God, and rendering devotional service to God, then haven't they reached the same goal I'm working towards? I can quote the Bible better than most Baptists I know. It really makes them angry (lol). The question would be: are they following the Bible? If they aren't, what good is it? So whatever religious path is chosen, the important thing is to follow it. Like these Muslim women I see around. They are unwaveringly devoted to their practices, and I admire them for that.  Krishna consciousness has spread all over the world. If you look at pictures of Deities that have manifested in different places, you will see that Their devotees have dressed and decorated Them with the personal flair of the culture where they are. The foods, etc., that are offered to the Lord are often locally traditional foods. Krishna consciousness adapts itself to the place it manifests. I don't mean that it dilutes the principles or anything, but that it has to be appropriate to time, place, and circumstance. An example is that in Siberia, it gets to like 100 below zero and stuff. You can't wear a gauze sari in that!  If your goal is to promote your culture or ethnicity that's fine, but I am not sure how that figures into religious practice.  As I think Laura's mentioned I've spent almost half my life (literally) researching religious beliefs. The path you choose is, in my opinion, not quite as important as whether or not it works for you. Whatever religious path you ultimately decide on, if it brings you closer to God, that's all that matters.  I'm not quite sure if this has been helpful. I don't actually know if I understood the issue in the first place. So if I've got it all wrong, please let me know.  Love Satyavati           ');"> postCount(' ');
