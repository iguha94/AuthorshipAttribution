         Today I watched   mangal aroti in LA by webcam .  It's really cool because they also have audio and you can switch around on the cameras and zoom in and stuff.  It was sooo neat.  Especially for me, because I don't have any experience of any other temple besides New Goloka, and in different places, things are a little different.  Like, all the songs are the same, and the basics are the same, but every place is individual, with its own mood and traditions.  So I am getting ready to watch the evening aroti as well in a bit.  The nice thing is that since it's west coast, mangal aroti is at 7:30 am.  I wish I had the resources to set up a system like this in Hillsborough!  Mangal aroti is my very favourite program of the day.  The Deities are so sweet in their pajamas and the mood is so intimate and special.  Of course, New Goloka is very small compared to the LA temple, and I think that contributes to the sense of intimacy.  But it is always so beautiful with just the altar lights on, and if I could spend one hour only at the temple every day, that would be it.  Having DSL has also made listening to web radio lots easier.  The quality of the broadcast coming over is a million times magnified and the video streams really, really well.  For this reason alone, especially if someone lives far from a temple, I would definitely recommend switching over to DSL from dialup.  Also, the connection never dumps you!  Pretty soon I will figure out more about how to play with the templates here.  This page is pretty darn boring looking.  I don't have money to dump into upgrading my account, so there are limitations to what I can do, but perhaps I can figure out a way to make it look a little better.  Hare Krishna!!!
