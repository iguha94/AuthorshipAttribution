         I said I was going to regret it, didn't I?  Boy am I going to sleep good today.  Gurudeva's group now has 37 members, growing exponetially (I don't even know what that word means but I know it has to do with math and it sounds good), and we got our new stove yesterday (smooth top, Kenmore, very nice) and the new fridge and kitchen floor are on the way.  Our house isn't beat up and gross, but the appliances are 10 years old now and needing to be updated and so on.  You know you're getting old when you can get excited over a refrigerator.  Work was tough and I don't want to talk about it.  We need help.   We need help.   I don't want to talk about it anymore unless you're a nurse who wants to come and work with me on my shift in my unit.  And if you are, please go   here  and apply, right away.  Tell them you want to work 7P-7A in CMTU with me.  My carpal tunnel syndrome has acted up for the last time.  I made an appointment today with my friendly neighbourhood orthopaedic surgeon, in fact the same one who rebuilt my ankle for me back in 2001 (and hollered at me for walking/working/driving on it for THREE MONTHS while it was broken/ruptured/torn/etc).  I didn't know he did hands too, but the hand specialist isn't free til the middle of February and he's next on the list for hands.  I have to have my hands.  I'm a nurse, for Christmas sake.  Right now it's just the one hand but I expect it will be the other one too after long.  I'll be happy to just have the one done.  How many days do you think I can get off work for this?  I'm so excited about the new stove but I'm kinda afraid to cook on it.  I'm afraid I'll drop something and break it.  So probably best I don't do anything until this evening.  I'm going to make that rajma I talked about.   Meanwhile, I have to get some sleep.  Have a lovely day, chant Hare Krishna, and be happy.    ');"> postCount(' ');
