         I could write about lots of work things this morning, but I'd like to focus on the preaching that seems to have spontaneously manifested there.  First of all, for the past two nights there's been people asking me to teach them the mahamantra, and sporadic chanting happening in patient rooms (one of which was very close to death).  Last night a copy of Bhagavad-gita was distributed, and someone asked some pretty detailed questions after seeing my tilak.  So I am pretty amazed about that.    I feel very good about wearing tilak to work.  I thought at first I would be very self conscious and uncomfortable, but I'm not.  At my last job, the atmosphere was kind of repressive, so I think maybe I had absorbed some of that paranoia.  But here everyone has been very respectful and cool about it.  Lots of people ask, though, and I am glad for that because it brings up opportunities to talk.  Also, I have a beautiful cloisonne pin of Lord Jagannath that I am wearing on my tag, and I feel good about Him smiling on everyone as I go in and out of rooms.  I think wearing tilak is even more helpful to me than it is to anyone else, because it helps me to focus and to remember what my real priorities are.  So recently I was writing about how after a little while (it took about a year at my last job) people learn about you and then when new people ask questions, they jump in and answer for you.  Remember?  Well, it's only taken four months at this job.  It's so cute to watch people as they talk about Krishna and chanting japa and beadbags and being vegetarian.  I get such a kick out of it.  To hear people talking like this is just the greatest thing.  And people saying Hare Krishna!  Does it get better?  It is all totally the mercy of Srila Gurudeva and Srila Prabhupada, giving me encouragement and help.  I'm not doing anything at all-everything is happening to me.  I am hearing rumours again of devotees here in Wilmington.  I am doing some investigating about it, but I have some misgivings on it, because I think if there were ISKCON devotees anywhere here, someone in Hillsborough would know about it.  It just seems odd to me.  Anyway, one of the respiratory therapists swears she knows someone who is a devotee, and she sent my email and phone number to them.  I don't know.  We'll see what happens.  It just seems so very odd to me, somehow.  I made a mistake at work last night and forgot to turn off a heparin drip.  It didn't result in harm to the patient, but it did result in a procedure having to be postponed.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it.  Nobody got hurt.  Things happen sometimes.  I am working very hard at learning more about this cardiac stuff.  One of my big focuses (foci?) is learning how to look at these telemetry strips and actually correlate the squiggles with processes happening in the heart.  I am getting a little better at it.  I was fortunate enough last night to have a float pool nurse that's been working cardiac since 1970.  I've known her for years, since the last time I worked at the hospital, and we sat down with a bunch of strips and talked about them.  I did manage to identify a sinus rhythm with a first degree AV (atrioventricular) block and a PVC (premature ventricular contraction) !!! And yes, I was practically crowing, I was so proud of myself.  And I learned about how to recognise atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and what the most common cause of a pause is (a nonconducted P wave).  So I am really excited.  She'll be back working with us on the 17th and we are planning to do more.  It is so great when you have someone working with you that knows so much.  If you just ask them to teach you, they will.  Most people don't take advantage of stuff like this.  When people see that you sincerely want to learn, they really go out of their way to help you.  People like to share their knowledge.  How can you bottle 34 years of cardiac experience?  I have to suck people's brains for this kind of stuff, otherwise I'll never learn.  This is probably the biggest thing new grads are missing out on-the lack of really experienced nurses in the hospital anymore.  I mean, even me, I can teach people some things, like basic stuff (I've been a nurse almost ten years now) but my knowledge is all really general medicine and a little rehabilitation.  I don't have any real specialised knowledge, like cardiac, or dialysis, or intensive care.  I'm just a regular old medical floor nurse.  If I have a talent, it's probably that I can spot someone going into DT's from six miles away in the dark, and I have good instincts for when something's going wrong even if I can't pinpoint it.  But what I do, or more accurately, what I've always done, is find really experienced nurses, and pick their brains.  I get them to talk to me, teach me things.  That's what new nurses should learn to do first and foremost.  You can't learn nursing out of a book-you have to learn how to see, and think, and listen to the voice in your head.  That kind of thing you really need to develop, and a good way to do it is to watch it in action.    Kind of like a nursing guru, I'd say.  Anyway, I'm very encouraged about the preaching efforts.  I feel like everything's going fairly well, and I'm motivated to do more.  Also, I'm back on my welding kick again, and I'm really wanting to learn how to do this tig welding.  I have so many projects and ideas in the back of my mind that I could do if I just had the knowledge and the equipment.  I have to do more research on this.          ');"> postCount(' ');
