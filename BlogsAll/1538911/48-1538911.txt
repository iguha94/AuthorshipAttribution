         I'm working tonight so I can make up some hours for the week.  Tomorrow, before I go to work, I have my preop appointment.  I am getting a little nervous, but I always get this way before I have to have some surgery (who wouldn't?)  I mean, this is my right hand we're talking about, and I'm right handed.  I play more than one musical instrument, and type 70+ wpm.  I spent two years in art school.  You just never really realise how much you actually need your hands until you can't use one.  Try it sometime and see how difficult it actually is to get dressed or cook or eat or drive with one hand.  I learned this when I worked in rehab.  I'd work with people who were recovering from a stroke, trying to learn how to put on socks with one hand.  It's terribly difficult, and folks worked real hard to try and relearn basic things like coordinaton and balance.    Now, I have a good doctor and I don't anticipate any problems.  But still, it's my right hand, and it's making me a little nervous.  I so have to wonder also at the people who come and visit my blog every day or more than one time a day (there are people who do this, if you can believe it) and never leave a comment.  I've made it so easy.  Just click on the link that says "BE PART OF THE REVOLUTION HERE".  It's about interaction, people.  Talk to me a little bit.  Otherwise it feels something like being watched in the shower.  You know what I mean?  Jeez.  In conclusion,   click here.   Scroll down and feast your eyes.  It will be the best thing you'll do all day.  Jai Sri Sri Radha Golokananda!    ');"> postCount(' ');
