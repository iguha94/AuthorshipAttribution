         So Carolina lost the big game.  At least they made a game of it.  Tilak: I normally wear gopi chandan tilak. I have seen some people who have very white/gray tilak (instead of the yellow that the gopi chandan is).  If you know where I can get some white tilak, PLEASE let me know.  Percocet makes me itch.  Unfortunately it isn't handling the pain so well anymore.  I doubt he will give me any more when I go see him today, but this hand is hurting a lot more than I expected it to.  And he knows I have a good pain tolerance!  I sort of think I dislodged a stitch with all I've been doing with this hand.  Today I go get this big bandage off FINALLY.  I am going to ask for a brace for it mostly for protection whilst driving.  Then I'm going to learn to drive with it!  I am hoping to get out of town for a couple days while it's healing up.  My husband does not breathe while he sleeps.  Medical people, what he does I swear is Cheyne Stokes.  Nonmedical people, this is how people breathe when they are trying to die.  It makes me crazy.  He needs a sleep study.  I swear he goes into arrest 20 times a night.  I have to nudge him to get him to start breathing again.  Then he gets mad at me for nudging.  Obviously my sleep patterns are still reflecting work.  I sort of sleep at random these days.   Sometimes feels like all I do is sleep and itch.  I hate Percocet.  Permission has been granted to build a temple in Moscow.   My spiritual master is on the board of directors.  I am hoping to have a seperate donation for the building fund when he gets here.  This surgery has screwed up the finances a little bit.  Not as bad as it could have! Hospital insurance is good.      ');"> postCount(' ');
