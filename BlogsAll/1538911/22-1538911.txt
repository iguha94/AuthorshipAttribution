         Received a letter from a devotee in Reading (UK) who is originally from Mauritius (I have a Godsister in Mauritius) and who is interested in approaching Srila Gurudeva to ask to be accepted as an aspiring disciple.  The devotee, Bhakta Kesava, asked for some help in composing the letter.  I too asked someone to help me with my first letter to Gurudeva, so I was happy to render some service.    Yesterday I didn't feel very well, but today I am going up to Hillsborough.  Bhaktin Polly will be there, so that's very exciting, and I am looking forward to it.  It's raining here, but abotu 72 degrees.. Hillsborough will be partly sunny but even colder, so I am making sure to dress warm.    Work's been good.  I am enjoying doing assessments and thinking, trying to put pieces together.  I'm learning a lot because I'm working with diagnoses and situations I've never had to deal with before, as well as learning about all the technology and new things that come with being a coordinator vs a staff nurse.  The charting on computer is getting easier.  Lots of things are the same.  I feel good about how things are going.  Next week I'm working Tuesday and Wednesday in Neuroscience, then I'm working the weekend in Geriatrics.  After that, who knows?    All I'm worrying about today is getting up to Hillsborough.  Sri Sri Radha Golokananda ki jai!   Email Me
