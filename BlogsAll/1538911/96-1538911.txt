         I didn't sleep again last night.  Today I'm kind of dazed (when was the last time I slept more than two hours?).  I went to the staff meeting at the hospital.  It's definitely not a good idea to drive anywhere near me.  Shifting is a bit dicey with this hand.  I thought they were going to call me in some more Percocet, but I ended up with Vicodin.   As I've said before, I don't generally like television with only a few exceptions.  Anything about dinosaurs or geology is good, and old Batman episodes, and some cartoons.  Beyond that, I haven't got much use for it.  These days, I think the best part of television are the commercials.  Here are some that stand out in my mind:   Current Commercials:   1.   The Wingman commercial .  I wrote a post on this once before, so I won't go into the whole sociological dilemma of it.  The music stays in my head, though.  2.   The Enzyte commercials .  I've written about these before too.  They're just too cutesy to not like.  3.   The Levitra commercials .  These I can do without.  Who really wants to know about Mike Ditka's sex life?  What I'd like to know is how much these celebrities are paid to get on television and say they can't perform without pharmacological intervention.  *Although I must admit it was absolutely fantastic that Mike D. said in that one commercial that baseball as a sport could use some Levitra.  Ain't it the truth!  I hate baseball.  That I'll keep for another post.  4.  T he Office Depot (or is it Office Max?) commercial  with that supply guy who dances around with his little buggy.  I want to work with this guy.  Unfortunately, in most places, any employee that happy would be earmarked for drug testing.  5.   The Fedex commercials .  They have a couple of good commercials going right now.  The one with the guy who's the MBA is good but this new one with 'Drama' is better.  6.  The whole 'TRUE' series from Budweiser :  All of these commercials are good.  My current favourite is the one with the referees spotting the ball and talking about drama on the football field.  There was a commercial way back in this series about a southern guy in a NYC bar, and I think that may have been the first one to catch my eye, because they all said 'How ya doin" and I never really realised til then how New Yorkers say that.   Great Past Commercial Campaigns   1.  The 9/11 Budweiser Clydesdale Commercial   Arguably the best commercial of all time and one that made me cry every time I saw it.  It was sentimental without being soppy and still managed to keep its dignity.  2.  Snickers    Snickers had a run of really great commercials last year or the year before.  There was one where the guy painted the football field with the wrong name (Chefs instead of Chiefs) and one where the quarterback got hit in the head too many times and thought he was Batman... there was a whole group of these that were really funny.  They haven't been as good since then.  Although the recent one with Michael Strahan is kind of cute.  3.  Volkswagen   I think Volkswagen has consistently made the best commercials over the past 10 or 15 years.  Whoever their ad people are, they should never get rid of them.  I can think of several great ones right off the top of my head: the one with the two guys who pick up the smelly chair, the one with the guy singing Mr. Roboto in the parking lot, the one with the music and everything is synchronised to the music (I never could figure out how they filmed that one) and the whole series of new Beetle commercials with the flower power theme.  Volkswagen just makes consistently good commercials.  That's all I have on my mind right now.  Today's agenda includes knitting, laundry, getting in a nap (since I didn't sleep last night) and I'd like to make some black bean soup.  It's sunny out but cold, so I think it would be good.          ');"> postCount(' ');
