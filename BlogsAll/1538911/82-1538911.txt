         I actually have a plan for a very nice Valentine's day post, if I have time to do it, but I just wanted to notate a couple of things here.  1. It's the middle of the night again and I've been up all night.  One nice thing about this is that I'm really whipping up on Gurudeva's sweater.  If I can keep going like this it'll be almost done by the end of the month. Then I have to work on Lord Nrsimhadeva's chaddar! 2. For Valentine's day I got Scott those RBH rear channel speakers he wanted, and a box of chocolates.  He was actually surprised, which doesn't happen often as I am way too obvious and can't keep a secret as well as he being extraordinarily perceptive about stuff.  Actually it was a last minute decision on my way home from work. 3. I got a lovely letter from Leslie, who is one of the people who read my blog regularly.  Thank you very much.  I'm hoping to have some time to respond today :) 4.  I'm going to be involved in a couple of interesting little projects at work.  One is a cultural diversity program (I love stuff like that) and another is tracking our admissions to look at utilisation of telemetry.  I'm not quite sure when I'll have the time to do either of these things but being in my position they sort of expect you to do some extra research types of things.    I don't feel particularly well this morning.  I feel like going to sleep, but then I'll be up around noon, and I have to work tonight.  This whole working nights thing is just hell on the system.  I feel quite bad that I haven't been utilising (twice in one post! how often does that happen?) this blog quite properly lately.  I promise I will focus on spiritual matters more consistently.  Seems like all I talk about lately is nursing, and I do enough of that at work.  The blog is for more important things than that.          ');"> postCount(' ');
