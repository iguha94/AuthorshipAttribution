         Today didn't begin very well, but I sure am feeling inspired this afternoon!    To begin with, I've been looking for a new job.  This is not the place I really want to talk about mundane things, but it does add to my general anxiety level, so I'm mentioning it.  As a result, I didn't sleep very well last night.  Well, I had forgotten, but I put an ad in the Adpak (local classified paper) about the Discussion Group, talking about distributing free cookbooks.  I got two calls!  I'm very excited about that and will be sending them out as soon as possible along with some information.  I am hopeful that maybe someone will take some further interest and decide to come and meet!  It is all by Krishna's mercy and through Gurudeva's blessings.  When we feel most fallen something happens to give us a drop of hope and we can carry on.  JAI GURUDEVA!!! JAI SRILA PRABHUPADA!!!  Also, I have two job interviews lined up for this week and tomorrow I need to call to make an appointment for a third.  I don't know that I'll be making any decisions this week but in this economy it sure does feel good to at least be getting interviews.  Feels like my cell phone has been going off all day!  But most of all I am excited to get some response about book distribution and hope that people take some further interest.  It would be the best thing I can think of to have a devotee group here and to be able to take association on a more regular basis and face to face!
