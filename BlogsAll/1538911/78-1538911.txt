         Just finished watching a show about Atlantis.  They presented different theories about where it might be, was it a myth, etc.  Lots of different scientists from around the world expressed their opinions.  I heard things I've heard before-that the island of Santorini (Greece) was really Atlantis, that the Minoan civilisation was really Atlantis.  I heard some things I hadn't before; that perhaps Troy was Atlantis, and that the Minoans eventually settled in Israel and became known as the Philistines of Biblical  fame.  One thing I hadn't heard before revolves around Ignatious Donnelly and   his book, Atlantis: The Antediluvian World .  The only reason this actually interested me was because when I was younger, one of my very favourite songs was by a man named Donovan (think Mellow Yellow, Sunshine Superman, etc) and called Atlantis.  So I found out tonight that Donovan got just about 100% of his ideas about Atlantis (and thus the body of his song) from that book by Ignatious Donnelly.  All right, so that was kind of interesting.  But what I thought was so strange really was that nobody's ever thought to correlate any of this with the Vedic literatures.  These writings span millions of years of the earth's history, and cover in great detail events and people that were around thousands and millions of years ago.  The city of Dwarka, in fact, in India, sunk into the ocean after Krsna left.  That was 5,000 years ago.  How come anyone hasn't looked here and made these correlations?  So science overall is looking, but not looking everywhere.  Why is that?  Is it ignorance?  Not putting stock in the writings of India versus, perhaps, the writings of the Greeks?  Or is it that the obvious is easily overlooked?  A text that states for itself that it covers X million of years or describes events that happened in X age, which is easily self-dated, may be too obvious for people to believe.  I'm not exactly sure why.  But this is happening quite blatantly, and I sure would like to know what the reasoning is behind it.  Vedic literatures speak of four ages (yugas) of the world, each progressively more degraded.  This age of the world we are in now is Kali-yuga, the most degraded, and the age of quarrel and violence.  In this age people have a shortened lifespan (which will continue to shrink as kaliyug progresses) and diminished physical capacity as well as poor morals and a tendency to irreligion.  Ultimately, at the end of kaliyug, (not scheduled to occur for another 432,000 years), the world as we know it will be annihilated by the last incarnation of Krishna, Lord Kalki, who arrives on a white horse bearing a sword to demolish the evil in the world.  Now anyone who knows anything about Revelation can instantly draw some parallels there.  I won't even bother going into it for you, because it's so amazingly obvious.  Anyway, following Lord Kalki's advent and decimation of the world, the whole cycle begins again, with a Golden age, wherein people have long lifespans, thousands of years, and greatly elevated principles and morals.  It is because of living in kaliyuga that we chant Hare Krishna.  In other ages where people had enormous lifetimes, they could spend the thousands of years needed in meditation, or to perform elaborate sacrifices.  But now, we have at best a hundred years, and we live in a world full of degradation and irreligion.  We aren't as intelligent or as morally upright, and so we are unable to sit in meditation, or perform enormous sacrifices, or to learn all of the Vedas.  For us, we require something simple and easy that we are able to perform even in our downgraded condition.  So Lord Caitanya stated that specifically for us in Kaliyuga, the proper way to achieve love of God is to chant His names:  Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare   This was a special concession to us because of the times we live in.  Anyway, I'd still like to know why no one's noticed this.  Chant Hare Krishna and be happy.         ');"> postCount(' ');
