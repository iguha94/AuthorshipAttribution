         I'm not working tonight.  The census was 22.  This would ordinarily be a really good thing except I'm having an inordinate amount of pain in this wrist.  I haven't had this much pain before in it, and I'm not sure to be disturbed or what by it.  Anyway, it's interfering with knitting, which means sitting in front of the TV is out, and being on the computer is rapidly becoming not an option, which is really going to limit me for the next eight or ten hours.  If I can't sleep, and I slept good today, this is going to be one long night.  I could go and study   this  if I was ambitious, but I don't think I'm really up to it right now.  I'm just kind of aggravated.  There's less than ten inches to go on the back of this sweater and then I can get on to the front, but I can't do it if this hand isn't going to cooperate.  I thought this surgery was supposed to FIX this problem, not exacerbate it.  I've been knitting steadily since I got the cast bandage taken off.  Why is it bothering me now?  This is day seventeen post op, I shouldn't be having any problems with it at all.  I even took some Aleve earlier, but it hasn't seemed to help at all.  I'm just really aggravated.
