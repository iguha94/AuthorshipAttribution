         Well, the storm should be here tonight.  Right now it's a little breezy and the sun is shining.  I am overcome today by terrible inertia.  I don't want to go to work.  The whole building is boarded up and it's like working in.... "the long dark of Moria."  I slept late today (very bad) but for some reason I just couldn't keep my eyes open.  I'm going in late today.    Our sister facility in Wrightsville Beach is moving into our facility.  I tell you, the whole management of this thing has been a joke.  Instead of making all these emergency plans back in May like they should have, the genii at corporate have spent the last two days making a complete mess of things.  Reason #735 I made the right decision.  However, there is one bright spot in all of this.  I won't have to stay at work tonight.  Since we live so close to work, I'll be able to come home to sleep.  That's the only bright spot I can find so far.  At the very least it will be good to stay at home.    I am looking forward to having this thing over and done with and getting through this weekend (I am on call) so I can finish out this last week and be done with it.  I need to move on and get these plans for preaching set up and start work on the real important stuff-introducing people to Krishna consciousness and helping to generate their interest.  All the rest of this is just fluff.
