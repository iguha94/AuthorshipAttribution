         I went to bed last night at nine and got up at one this morning.  So, situation normal there.  Scott said that once we get into our new house and get settled et al, that I am never working nights again.  I think he vacillates between awe at how I function on so little sleep so chronically, and worry that I'm either going to just keel over or fall asleep behind the wheel or something.  Really I can go for weeks and months on like two, three hours sleep a day.  The problem is that I'm not using all that extra time productively.  I have, however, been knitting as much as my hand will allow.  It's best for like half hour or so, then a break.  I am feeling the pressure to get it done-I have the whole back and front to do, so I feel like every minute I have to be working on it.  I decided to withdraw from school because I'm just not doing it.  I'm way behind and I am not in the mindset to do it.  I refuse to feel guilty about it-it's just not something my heart is in.  All the priorities are in a different place right now.  Plus, with all this education they are putting us through at work, how much available space do I actually have in my brain?  I am definitely going up to the temple this weekend.  I was going to go for a few days, remember, but I just don't think it's a good idea with all this medication I'm still taking and all the precautions I have to take with keeping my hand clean and stuff (not that it's dirty up there, because it isn't).  Just that doing everything I need to do is easier done from here.  For the longest time I was looking for an Indian tiffin container.  This is like a series of three metal containers, small round containers, that all stack and fit into a carrier.  Like a lunchbox.  But it has seperate containers for different things.  Well, I couldn't find one, not even on Ebay, which has God knows everything.  But I found something better that's made by Thermos Nissan.  Is this the same Nissan that makes cars? Who knows.  Anyway, they are making like steel Thermos bottles and so on and they have this one that has four round containers that fit into a steel thermos and it's supposed to keep things hot for 12 hours or cold for 24.  So this will be nice for bringing home prasadam from the temple for Scott, or when I go up and spend time there.  Tonight I was watching some DVDs of Srila Prabhupada.  My conception of him is fuzzy, only from books and lectures and photographs, but to see him moving and interacting with people and speaking, is really amazing.  He was so confident always without being arrogant, just very convinced of the reality of his words.  He seemed to be very strong yet very delicate at the same time-sometimes the camera man would focus on his hands and you can see there, like when he played the karatals, that his touch was both strong yet very precise and delicate.  It was fun to see him with the children.  Some people believe that only Srila Prabuhpada should be the guru.  This idea, caled rtvik theory, has been a major source of controversy within our community.  I don't usually talk about things like this here, but I can say pretty openly that I don't buy into it.  It doesn't make sense to me.  How can a society grow and continue to grow if the succession is broken?  The disciplic succession has been going on for thousands and thousands of years.  We see that Srila Prabhupada's guru was Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur, and so on back down the line.  This is the disciplic succession.  My guru, HH Indradyumna Swami, is a disciple of Srila Prabuhpada.  It just continues in this way.  Of course Srila Prabhupada is very special, because he brought Krsna Consciousness to the west and founded our Society.  He is like a grandfather to us, grand-guru, and we are grand-disciples.  Of course he holds a special place.  But that doesn't mean that everything should stop there.  Of course it has to continue on.  I think that people need to be very aware though, and use a lot of discretion and serious thought and prayer when seeking for the guru.  It's very easy to be cheated and misled, so we have to approach this very carefully.  All the scriptures say that we should examine the guru very carefully before accepting him (or her) and that the guru should do the same for the disciple.  In this way we can be sure that we are getting the bonafide real deal.  Prayer is a very big part of it, because when Krsna sees that we are serious about spiritual life, He sends the guru to us.  Actually, the guru is a manifestation of Krsna Himself.  When you are serious about learning about spiritual life and ready to commit to it, Krsna Himself comes to you in the form of the guru to guide you back home.  So you need to pray very sincerely about it.  Some people go for years or a whole lifetime without ever finding their guru.  I didn't have this experience-the first time I got to the temple, my spiritual master was there waiting.  So everyone's experience is very different.  I think I am more the exception than the rule, because most people take several years with it at the least.  I think that westerners in general have a problem with authority, accepting authority.  We don't like to do it.  Everyone wants to be the boss.  Unfortunately, that mentality only leads to more problems.  The only way to learn anything is to first of all admit you don't know, and then to listen and do what your teacher says.  This goes with anything, not just spiritual life.  Like when I was in nursing school, you had to watch someone do a procedure.  Then when you tried to do it, you were watched, and corrected if necessary.  You couldn't just go in and say, 'oh, I know how to do that', when you didn't.  Even now if there is a procedure I don't know how to do, I call someone or find someone to show me how.  If I was too proud or arrogant to do that, I could potentially hurt someone through my ignorance.  So spiritual life is the same way.  First you have to admit you don't know.  Then you have to find someone who does know, and that's the guru.  Then you say to the guru, okay, I don't know, so please teach me, and I will listen and do what you tell me to do.  That's what it's all about.  The problem for many people comes when guru says, don't do this, don't do that.  Like guru might say, OK, if you are serious about spiritual life, no intoxication.  People think, oh no! I have to give up drinking? and they don't want to do it.  Or illicit sex.  People don't want to give it up.  Then they turn around and say, oh, this must be a cult, it's very restrictive, trying to tell me what to do with my personal life.  But they're not realising, they wanted to learn about spiritual life, well, this is how it gets done.  You can't just have your cake and eat it too.  And most people don't even realise how things they do are actually detrimental to them.  Or they do realise but they just don't care because they want to 'enjoy' in the moment.  Intelligent people, though, will stop and understand, and obey what the guru says, and later on when they get a little bit more realisation and understanding, they can say, yes, I can understand now that this is something for my own good, although it seems like an austerity, really it makes my life easier and better.  So all these things we do, like giving up meat, fish, eggs, intoxication, illicit sex, all of this at first seems like a terrible trial and austerity.  But later on we can realise that it makes life so much easier, and we are better for it.  And if we know something about other religions or the history of religion, we can also understand that these things are not unusual.  In fact, most serious religious practice will enjoin these same things to one degree or another.  It's just that most people aren't really serious about following religious practice.  Well, I'm not sure how understandable that all was, so if you have any questions, just ask.  In a few weeks I am going to give a talk at the college in a class on religion that a friend of mine is taking.  I'm really looking forward to it.  It's something I've never done before so I am really relishing the opportunity.  Thank goodness I am used to speaking in front of people so I won't be nervous.  I just need to find out if I can have the whole hour or not :)  Have a good day, and chant Hare Krishna to be happy.            ');"> postCount(' ');
