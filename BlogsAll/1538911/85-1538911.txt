         I just called the sheriff's department on our nextdoor neighbour to report a noise problem.  This isn't the first time I've ever done this, and it won't be the last.  It's sort of like the rotation of the earth by the moon: something that happens and you just can't stop it.  In all fairness I must say the music has been louder in the past and there is a marginal possibility that he may not actually realise that it's loud enough to wake me from sleep despite the fact that I went well over 30 hours with no sleep prior to finally falling asleep.  However, unlike my husband (He Who Cannot Be Roused), I have absolutely no tolerance for this kind of thing.  We live in one of America's most horrific institutions: The Planned Community.  This is capitalism at its finest: a calculated plan to house four families per acre in single-family dwellings.  It's a nice place, but it comes at a cost.  The House Police make Stalin's Russia seem like Disneyworld.  These retirement-age,  self-righteous suburban dictators roll through here on adult tricycles like Hitler observing the troops in review, making sure you've got your crabgrass under control and the height of your fence in strict compliance with The Covenants.  You'd think it was God and Abraham the way they talk about The Covenants, and quite frankly, The Homeowners Association might as well be The Holy Trinity the way these folks wield power.    Anyway, what I'd like for you to imagine is your stereotypical (and I dislike stereotypes, but I'm trying to give you an accurate picture here) late-30's southern redneck boy.  I'm talking drunk at eleven in the morning riding the John Deere mower (on the quarter acre).  Confederate flag flying proudly in the back yard.  Blew a hole through the roof once playing with the shotgun. Takes the Harley out in the driveway, spends five minutes redlining it, and puts it back in the garage four or five times a day.  Had a sticker on the old truck saying 'This Country Was Built By White Men With Guns'. Second wife took off about a month ago.  Do you have the image clear now?  We (myself and the neighbour) had a jolly brawl about five or six years ago when he woke me up one morning beating a labrador puppy with a belt.  He Who Cannot Be Roused was not at home that fateful morning, but I had to call him quite frantic at work to come home before our house (and me specifically) got blown full of shotgun holes.  Despite the fact that we are (damn) Yankees, my good husband manages to get along with this man in a cordial and quite friendly manner.  (That's because, as I said at his job the other day, 'Everybody loves Scott.')  Anyway, I have extremely little tolerance for this loud music in the middle of the night crap.  I'm not one of these people who calls the sheriff screaming or creating a scene.  I don't even want to talk to the deputy, personally, because I'd rather let him wonder which one of his neighbours called.  In a neighbourhood where four houses share one acre, you have to have some sort of awareness that sound carries, particularly the sound generated by bigass Kicker subwoofers.  Now please.  You know what our theatre system is like in this house, and nobody appreciates fine acoustics quite like we do.  But not at two in the morning.     Now, typically the way this goes is that the deputy will come out, the music will get shut off for fifteen or twenty minutes (long enough for me to just barely fall back to sleep) and then it'll start up again.  And then I'll call again.  This pattern gets repeated two or three times, or until about four-thirty AM, whichever comes first, and then, when all real chance for quality REM sleep has been obliterated, the music will cease.  I got a call yesterday afternoon just after I got home from work telling me I needed to come in this morning at 8 AM for a meeting with me, the day coordinator, the manager and the director.  This will mean that I will be at work for one reason or another every day for seven days straight.  I wouldn't say I'm exactly bitchy, but I am tired.  Regardless.  I used to get myself all in a state when I called the cops like this.  Then I got over it.  If it's loud enough to wake me up, it's too loud.  There's probably 50 feet between his house and ours.  It's the middle of the night.  Grow up, shut up, sober up, and let me sleep.  End of rant.          ');"> postCount(' ');
