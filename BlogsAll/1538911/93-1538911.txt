         We're in a tornado watch until 11PM.  I am terrified of tornadoes.  The problem with them is that there's no warning.  At least a hurricane you know is coming.  So I'll be nervous the rest of the evening now.  During Hurricane Fran, we had a tornado very close to our house, about a mile away.  All the trees were snapped off in a path about 40 feet wide.  I guess it wasn't a very big tornado, but to me, it was pretty darn scary just looking at what was left.  Don't get me wrong.  Hurricanes are pretty scary too, and you can get a tornado to spin off of one in a heartbeat.  18 hours of 120+mph winds can be pretty nervewracking.  But most people leave, and the ones who don't, know what they're in for.  Me, I can never leave, because I have to be at work.   Just how it is.  We've been through about six direct hits here since 1993 when we moved in.  At this point, we don't get nervous until the winds are sustained over 125.  And we have a standing agreement that if the storm will be category 4 or higher at landfall, he takes the dog and goes.  You have to be realistic about this kind of thing.  My parents live out on one of the islands, and they're pretty much hardasses, and won't leave.  Now they can stay legally, because they're in the Coast Guard Auxiliary and run a radio hub out of their house and stuff.  I never thought my mom'd get into that, but she has, and now she's become a daggone good navigator.  On sea, that is.  Don't ask her to take you to Walmart.  So they go out and run patrols and do all kinds of things, tow boats and everything else.  They have a 34' Marine Trader called the Christine Ann II, and my father's got an eye on a couple of bigger boats (one was 85', as if they really needed all that boat).  Anyway, they don't leave during hurricanes anymore.  I've stopped worrying about them except incidentally.  Hell, they have more training in this stuff than I do.  There's been another rather large change.  The  Wilmington Vedic Discussion Group  is now the    Coastal Center for Bhakti-yoga  .  Call it a PR campaign but I think the new name more clearly says what I'm about and will generate some more interest than the other name.  I will have new cards made and so on.  Pretty soon I'll be able to set up a solid schedule for going out and preaching.  It's 55 degrees out and has been raining off and on all day.  Despite the tornado warning, I'm thinking about going out for a japa walk.  I feel pretty good today and I'd like to do a bit of exercise.  We live in a neighbourhood that allows me to feel safe even at 3 or 4 in the morning, so I sometimes like to go out walking and chanting.  Scott's got some kind of loud Gladiatoresque movie going on and really, that's not all that conducive to japa, so it's better if I go out for a while.  My hand's been unusually painful today, so I don't know how much knitting I can get done this evening.  I'm hearing some conflicting reports about actually when Gurudeva will be here, but I'm hoping to get something concrete relatively soon.          ');"> postCount(' ');
