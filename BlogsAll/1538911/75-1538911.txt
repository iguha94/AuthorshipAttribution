         Here are some random thoughts for this morning:  1. I went to Walmart earlier.  It's nice to go in the middle of the night.  There was a man there positively having a meltdown that there were three people in line and only one cashier open.  I don't understand what the big rush was.  Where are you going to go, really, at three in the morning?  I mean, back off the Mountain Dew, you know?  Anyway, I wandered around for a while and spent some money.  2.   Gardenburger  makes vegan meat-substitute meals.  Now, they're very good.  The problem to me, is actually, that they're very good.  It kind of seems just as bad to eat something that tastes identical to meat if you are avoiding meat for ethical reasons.  I mean, what are you saying here?  "Gee, I'd really LIKE to kill and eat you, but I can't do that, so I'm going to make something that is an identical substitute."  ??? I am not sure if I'm explaining this right, but it seems almost like it's just as bad to be eating something that tastes exactly the same.   I bought a few different ones tonight, and I don't know, I have guilt when I eat them.  Seems to me like it's just too close to the real thing.  I'm not sure if you'll understand that, but it's true just the same.  3. I am having, as far as I'm concerned, far too much pain in this hand.  My thumb, especially, is really no different than it was before, and in fact worse.  I am not sure what's going on with it.  I try to use it and do as much therapy with it as I can, but things like doorknobs and turning the car on are still not happening.  Later on this morning I am going to call and talk to his nurse and see if I can get something for it.  The incision looks great.  I am just not liking the amount of pain I am still having here.  4. I got a call from work around 2 AM.  They didn't leave a message, but I somehow knew it was them (we don't have caller ID) so I called them back.  There are some MAJOR staffing issues this morning.  I talked with the charge for a few minutes, but there really wasn't anything I could do personally, so after a mini-lecture on why not to call my house at 2 AM (that's the death call, or it better be if you want to get my butt out of bed), I decided I was just going to go to Walmart.  I was up and dressed anyway.  It is very nice to not have to be on call anymore.  Eileen, our director, stressed in a meeting last week that me and Christy (the day coordinator) only have shift responsibility-in other words, when we go home, that's it.  That's just how I wanted it.  I can't tell you how awful it is to be on call.  5.  There is this charity drive going on called St. Baldrick's Day.  What it is, is that you pledge to shave your head, and people put up money to see you do it, and all the money goes to support children's cancer research.  Now, being that my hair is down to my butt, I figured a lot of people would put up the cold cash to see me shave my head.  It's a good cause.  I was getting myself all psyched up for it, but Scott said absolutely not no way don't ask again and don't even think about doing it.  After I got over my disappointment, I realised it was probably for the best anyway.  How would I keep my nurses' cap on my head if I have no hair?  Duct tape?  Anyway, that's all for this morning.  Have a good day.  Hopefully I'll sleep through most of it.         ');"> postCount(' ');
