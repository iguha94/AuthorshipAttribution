         We're in the middle of a Winter Storm Warning.  We're supposed to get snow by 8AM.  I'm doubting it.  Right now it's 35 degrees out and the radar is clear as can be.  So I don't know what they're talking about.  As per usual, it's 2AM and I'm up.  Today I have to go to a Kronos class.  Kronos is the timekeeping software we use at work.  Then tomorrow, I have an all-day class on cardiac stuff again.  The hospital is really hot on education now that they have this magnet designation.  Today is Siva Ratri.  This is the day when women particularly will ask Lord Siva to give blessings on their husbands.  The best blessing, of course, would be that one's husband become Krishna conscious, and that, as always, is my prayer.  Here are some prayers in honor of Siva Ratri:  Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami has composed a prayer in his Vraja Vilas Stava:   muda gopendrasyatmaja bhuja parisranga nidhaye sphurad gopirvrndair yam iha bhagavatam pranayibhih/ bhajadbhistair bhaktya svamabhilasitam praptam acirad yamitire gopisvaram anudinam tam kila bhaje  "I daily worship Gopisvara Mahadeva, who is situated on the bank of Yamuna. That very Gopisvara was worshipped with deep devotion by the gopis. Gopisvara Mahadeva quickly fulfilled their desire to attain a supremely precious jewel in the form of the embrace of the son of Nanda Maharaja."  Sri Sanatana Gosvami has also written in Sri Brhad Bhagavatamrta:  vrindavanavani-pate jaya soma soma-maule sanaka-sanandana-sanatana-naradedya gopisvara! vraja-vilasi-yuganghri-padme prema prayaccha nirupadi namo namaste  "O gatekeeper of Vrindavana! O Soma, all glories to you! O you whose crest is decorated with the moon. You are worshipable for the sages, Sanat, Sanaka, Sanandana, and Sanatana, and by Narada! O Gopisvara! Desiring that you bestow upon me prema for the lotus-feet of Sri Sri Radha-Madhava who perform joyous pastimes in Vraja-dhama, I offer pranamas unto you time and again."          ');"> postCount(' ');
