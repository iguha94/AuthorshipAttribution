         So today in the news kids are killing each other in schools and trying to kill themselves.  I don't know.. can someone actually be depressed enough to be seriously suicidal and not have anyone know it?  When you're young and in school and around people all the time?  I think everyone goes through a time in their lives when they at least contemplate things like that.  I know that years ago I did.  Males are more likely to actually attempt suicide than females, and they use different methods than females do.  But I still think, when we're talking about kids, someone should be paying enough attention to notice this sort of stuff.  Maybe this would be a good time to scroll back to my last rant and read all that stuff I wrote about unwanted children and evil karma.  I don't make this stuff up.  It's all there, in the Vedas, for anyone to read.  Krsna Himself, in the Bhagavad-gita, told Arjuna exactly what would happen if people stopped taking marriage seriously and engaging in illicit sex all over the place.  Now, unfortunately, we're looking at it.  How much more convincing do people need to realise they are on the wrong path?  Tomorrow's my last day at work.  It doesn't really feel like it.  There's so much chaos going on there it's practically unbelievable.  I think it's a good time to get out.
