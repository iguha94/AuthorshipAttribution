         OK.  First things first.  You gotta read this story.  A nurse at the hospital I work at went to New Mexico and got chewed on by a pack of sixteen wild dogs.  It's unbelievable but true.    Read it here .  Next.  You know what irritates me?  There is this incredible longstanding bias against smoking on television.  Now, okay, you shouldn't smoke.  This is coming from someone who smoked more than 20 years before giving it up (Hare Krishna!).  But the problem is that in between these "TRUTH" commercials about the horrors of smoking, there's incredibly cute Wingman (and the new WingTail featuring a very cute dog) commercials all about beer.  Now, maybe I'm an idiot. But I've never heard of anyone smoking a cigarette, getting in a car, and killing five innocent people because they were impaired.  Why isn't there more anti-drinking stuff on television?  Drinking is worse than smoking in my opinion.  This is coming from someone who has been sober almost fourteen years (Hare Krishna!).  But the point of the matter is, if you're going to bust smoking, then you ought to bust drinking.  Nailing the tobacco industry while letting the alcohol industry get off scot free seems to be suspect in my book.  Someone's paying someone off here.  So.  Moving on to the next bit of rant-a-roni, last night could have been worse.  It could have been better, I assure you.  My hand is NOT really ready for this.  I had no idea how much it was going to hurt to actually write.  For all the typing and knitting I've done, I haven't done hardly any writing, and it hurts to hold a pen.  Plus I haven't had any pain medicine for it in over 24 hours now and that doesn't help at all.  Plus I had cramps and some whiny nurses to deal with.  I can't stand a whiny nurse.  I'd rather have the cramps.   I can't help it when some things happen.  I do the best I can.  That's my job.  But regardless of how well I do my job, some things are going to happen that we don't like.  I can't help that.  Learn to live with it, people.  If you can't handle it, go work at Walmart.  That's what I always say I'm gonna do when I'm grown up and done with nursing.  I want to be the greeter at Walmart.  "Hi! Welcome to Walmart!  Would you like a buggy or a basket?"  See? I can do it.  Actually, what I want to be is a paleontologist.  I keep thinking I'll take some geology classes at UNCW.    Anyway, I have to be back at the hospital in just under four hours for that class.  I'm not working tonight, so that will be not-so-bad, and then tomorrow I have another class all day long, and then off on Friday, and work through Monday.  I am going to try very, very hard to not fall asleep during this class.  I don't even know what it's about.  I just know it must be pretty important for my boss to tell me to go ahead and take myself off the schedule so I can make it.  It's kind of raw and nasty out there today.  It would be a good day to sleep, but I won't get more than a nap in late this afternoon.  I got some tilak from a friend of mine that came from Radha-kunda, which is the absolute holiest place on this planet.  It's pretty amazing.  It smells unbelievable.  I will write more on tilak tonight.  I also got some very nice Deity photos from another friend in Detroit and some very nice embroidered beadbags (I have a fetish for embroidered beadbags.  I am embarrassed to tell you how many I have.) as a gift.  I am going to put together some nice things and send back some presents.  It's so nice to get presents in the mail like that.  I suppose I ought to find something to eat and try to find my ritalin.  I do NOT like working without it.  I should have a note from the doctor that says I don't have to work if I don't have my ritalin.  It just makes life so much easier.  Have a good day and chant Hare Krishna to be happy.
