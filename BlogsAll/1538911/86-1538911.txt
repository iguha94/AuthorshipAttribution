         We just watched a show about this man named Alan Page.  If you don't know who he is, he was defensive player in the NFL.  He grew up in Canton, Ohio, and first played for the Bears.  He had nine consecutive pro bowl appearances.  After he got married, he decided to go to law school, while still playing football.  Despite having to deal with prejudice and racism (see previous post for my views on this) he persevered.  The Bears let him go and he moved to the Vikings, leading the team in sacks and blocked kicks in his first season with them.  He was very instrumental in the Players Association and provided a lot of leadership fighting for players' rights.  Ultimately, he retired from football with a stellar career behind him.  From there, he finished law school, passed the bar, and began in a private practice.  After several years of this, he moved on to work in the Minnesota Attorney General's office.  Deciding from there that he wanted to pursue an appointment on the Minnesota State Supreme Court, he successfully sued the Governor of Minnesota and blocked a lengthening of term of one of the justices currently sitting at the time, and then won a vote to obtain a seat on the bench as a Supreme Court Justice in the state of Minnesota, becoming not only the first black supreme court justice in the state, but also the first person to win a statewide election for same.  Justice Page also runs the Page Education Foundation, sponsoring over 3400 scholarships for highschool students in need to provide educational opportunities for those who would otherwise not have them.  Because of the Foundation, kids have gone on to become doctors, lawyers, nurses, and other professional people.  This man is absolutely incredible.  He was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame.  He proved he was not only physically talented but incredibly gifted with intelligence.  Through all his stunning success he's never allowed it to inflate his ego or blur his vision, and has always remained true to his vision of helping children through bettering education.  I was just so incredibly humbled, touched, and impressed by this man.  I don't even have the right words to express how awesome he actually is.  I guess you can maybe judge how impressed I was by how well I paid attention through the whole thing, even without my ritalin.  What a role model.  I wish I could be more like that.
