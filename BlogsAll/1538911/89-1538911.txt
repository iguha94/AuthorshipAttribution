         One of the most cliche'd images that comes to my mind when people talk about racism is the vision of the white supremacist sitting at a desk in front of the American flag with a Bible and a shotgun before him.  So many people have used or try to use and still to this day use religion as an excuse for racism and other forms of prejudice, and they're absolutely dead wrong.   I could give you a long list of quotes from the Bible, the Koran, the Dhammapada and the Bhagavad gita (which collectively cover the Judeo-Christian, Islamic, Buddhist and Hindu worlds, a substantial majority of the earth's population), but I decided that it would be much simpler and to the point to simply explain why there's no logical excuse for racism from a religious perspective or otherwise.   We are not the body.   It's that simple.    This material body that we get at birth has absolutely nothing to do with who we are as people.  What's the difference between a living body and a dead body?  Consciousness-the presence of the soul.  Anyone who's ever seen a person actually die (I have) knows that there is a moment of death, and you can actually see that moment when the consciousness leaves the body, and the life goes with it.  The actual 'person' is the spirit, not the flesh and blood it rides around in.  The body is like a Yugo.  It's well made, on average, but fragile, and subject to problems like disease.  It gets old, breaks down.  Sometimes even from birth you get a lemon, that has chronic problems and dysfunctions with it.  It's a body, that's all.  It doesn't make you who or what you are.  In this material world we like to assign everything by material designations: I'm white, I'm female, I'm American, I'm poor, I'm this, I'm that.  What we fail to realise is that all of these material designations are absolutely meaningless in the big picture.  The soul goes through countless bodies again and again, life after life, and the body we get in this life is because of something that happened in a past life.  It's purely arbitrary, and at the end of this life, we'll get another body that might not be anything like this one.  So we make all these designations that really have no meaning at all.  Once we can understand that we have nothing to do with the body beyond riding around in it, we can see that prejudice is a material conception based on false understanding.  It's like judging me because I drive around in a white 1995 Jeep Wrangler.  I'm not the car.  The car can't do anything without me driving it-it has no life or capability on its own.  When I, the soul, drive the body of the car, it does lots of things.  But nobody mistakes me for my car.  The understanding is clear that the car has no power of its own.  Neither does the body-without the spirit in it, it's just a lump of flesh that ultimately decays and deteriorates.  So when we look at people, we have to understand that all these physical, cultural and social differences are temporary.  As spirit souls, we don't have any of these designations-there's no such thing as 'American' souls vs. 'Cambodian' souls vs. 'Russian' souls, or black or white, or female or male for that matter.  The designations are a false creation based upon temporary housing of the soul, and therefore just an expression of ignorance.  With or without prejudice attached to it, the designations are an expression of ignorance.  We also recognise that ALL living beings, not just humans, are eternal spirit souls in different bodily forms than human ones, and that they deserve the same respect and care as we do-hence vegetarianism and the principle of ahimsa or nonviolence.  We can just as easily obtain an animal body in our next life as a human one, or a nonmoving entity such as a plant or tree.  Every living being has a soul.  So anyone can see that prejudice is ignorant behaviour based upon an ignorant premise.  People who try to use religion as an excuse for prejudice are even worse, because every major religious tradition in the world teaches that we are all ultimately brothers and sisters (ha, there I go with material designations) and should be loved as we love ourselves.  Tolerance can be found in both the Koran and the Bible.  Eastern religions recognise the presence of the soul in ALL living things and advocate nonviolence towards all creatures, what to speak of simply humans.  So with just a bit of logic and seeing things as they really are (not as we'd like them to be) we can understand that racism, sexism, nationalism and other forms of prejudice are expressions of ignorance, based only on temporary material nature, and not on the eternal truth of the spirit soul.
