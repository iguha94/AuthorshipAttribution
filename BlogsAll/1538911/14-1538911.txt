          I GOT MY NAME CHANGED!   It's legal-my name is Satyavati devi dasi.  Of course, I kept my last name too.  I have a court order and everything to prove it.  I'm so excited.  I almost wish I could have done it Tuesday so that my nameday and my birthday would be the same.  My spiritual birthday, though, is April 25.  So it's so exciting.  I have so much to do now though-so many things to change.  Monday I'm going to get my driver's license renewed (it was up anyway) so that will be changed, and I'll need to call the Board of Nursing to see about my nursing license.  There's lots of other things that will have to be changed, but those two and my social security card are the biggies.  I made a form letter up that I'll be sending to people to get things changed over.  It will probably take us a good six months to get it all done properly.  But I'm totally excited about it.    I got a call from Sucharya mataji today.  It is always so inspiring to speak with advanced devotees.  She is planning on visiting Wilmington with her daughter Lalita soon, so perhaps we can spend some time together when they're down.  I also got the newest newsletter from Prema mataji, and I need to write some emails myself.  I am very fortunate to have such great association, even from far away.
