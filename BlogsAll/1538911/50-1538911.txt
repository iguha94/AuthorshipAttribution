         More people have called about the stove.  I keep calling them back or whatever but then they don't call.  Some lady called my cell phone THREE times today when I was asleep.  I finally called her back, and she was all haughty, this n that, about it.  I'm like, look, I work nights, I'm sleeping when you call, what can I tell you.  So she said she'd give the address to her son.  I told her to have him come by after 5, when Scott'd be home.  I mean, it's free.  If you don't want it, fine, I'm not all that worried about it.  If you want it, come and get it.  But leave the attitude at home.  I don't HAVE to be giving it away.  What's the matter with people?  I'm going to have an office night at work!  I have to move all my junk from our old office, from which we were evicted, to the new office, which is both bigger and better.  I'm bringing in some nice pictures and a calendar and some other various assorted goodies for the walls.  I have a nice little postcard of Radha kunda in a frame that I'm going to put up.  I ought to just spring for a big picture.  Maybe I will.  I have a 16x20 of it in the bedroom.  It's beautiful.  Someday I hope I can go there.    ');"> postCount(' ');
