         So I got woken up by a phone call at 0730.  I have to go back to sleep.  I have to work tonight and tomorrow, and then I'm going to do some kind of marathon so I don't lose any time next week (I was scheduled for the weekend et al) having this surgery.  It seems inevitable to me that I'll at least lose 40 hours but what can I do? I have to have it done.  If I'm tough I can get back to work after just a week.  I'm going to play with my schedule tonight and see what I can do with it to stretch out my days to give me the most time off.  I don't want to burn up ALL my time because I have to think about Gurudeva being here and the time I will need off for that.  I mean, I can take it unpaid, I don't care, but it's still better to have it paid if I can work it out.  It's 27 out but somehow it looks much colder than that.  I think I'm going to unplug the phone.  If you get a chance, you should really make that black bean recipe, because it came out SO good.  It isn't chili-hot, but the ginger and cayenne make it just warm, and it's more of an afterburn than a present fire, if that makes any sense at all.  It just came out really, really good.  And even better after it sat in the fridge for a while.  I'm hoping that if I sleep until noon or one I won't have any trouble flipping my schedule over tonight.  It's just tonight and tomorrow, and then I'll be off Saturday at least before I get into a three-day marathon.  Rereading the above paragraph, the whole attention deficit thing suddenly becomes very clear to me.  I've known I have it since 87, and I've been on Ritalin since 98, but it's pretty rare that you get to see it right out there bold and beautiful in all its glory.  Imagine having to live with that mess in your head all the time.  It does have its good points, but I'll save them for another post.  All right, I'm back to bed.    ');"> postCount(' ');
