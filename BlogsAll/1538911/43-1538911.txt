         I got home about 2345 and got in the bed about 0045 but I haven't been able to sleep.  I'm nauseous, and I just can't get myself to relax.  I gave up altogether about twenty minutes ago, and just decided to go ahead and get ready.  It wouldn't be quite so bad if my stomach wasn't upset, but I'm NPO and I can't even have any coke syrup on it.    So my options for anaesthesia are: local, IV regional, or (I think) conscious sedation.  I really, really don't think I want to be alert and oriented for this.  Being a nurse, I just think I'd freak out if I heard someone say 'oops'.  You know?  So I am going to ask for some ativan or something.  I don't want demerol.. I just don't really want to hear anything they're going to say.    I know I'm being melodramatic but I just keep worrying.  My wrists are so small-really they are the smallest part of me- just under 6", and I keep thinking that he just won't have enough room to get around and do what he needs to do, or even worse, that he'll nick something accidently because the quarters are so cramped.  I know I am being paranoid.  I get a little bit like this before every surgery, pretty much.  I think this one is worse than my ankle surgery because I had been in so much pain for so many months before that one, and because I keep thinking.. oops my mom is here.. got to go.
