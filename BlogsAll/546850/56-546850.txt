         I'll summarize the last post into a more easily readable post, in the near future.  Anyhow, all I did today and yesterday was watch TV.  Ok, I also led worship for my roommate's small group time.  That was good.  I didn't prepare adequately for the kids tomorrow, though. ` Why?  The small things that I always give my attention to, throughout the week, always end up sucking up hours on end of my time.  I just got a new computer.  On Tuesday, I went home to pick up all the parts.  It was going to only be for a little bit, but then I decided to start cleaning my brother's car.  That ended up becoming a 3 hour task.  I then wanted to take my little brother to get an anti-static bracelet from CompUSA, but my mom decided to come along... that became a 1.5 hour ordeal.  Then, over the next 3 days, I spent all my time building my computer, installing, tweaking, etc.  Then, Friday hit.  My brother asked me to help him make a dish for lunch and a potluck that evening.  That became a 3 hour ordeal.  I then had to go on campus to take care of some business, then back...  And, throughout the week, on countless occasions, I sat down and picked up the remote, to find my self falling asleep 4 hours later after having watched 2 movies.  That's where my time goes.
