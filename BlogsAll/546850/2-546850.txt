         Wow, what a good practice today. I practiced guitar for about an hour; today's regimen was focused on strumming.  I used a program called "Fruity Loops" as both a metronome and pattern trainer... it's really cool, basic point and click. I've been trying to train myself speed, consistency, endurance, and a good ol' sense of rhythm... I'm especially trying to get down a 1/32 strum.  By the way, I'm on my way to putting pictures up.  First up is the trip to Boston last January.  Jane and Amanda came down to hang out here with everyone;  at the end of that week, Jimmy, his—ok, now he's our—friend Dan, and I drove up with them to hang out in Boston.  What would have been a 7 hour drive (we actually were making quite good time) ended up a 14 hour doozy... thanks to this tractor trailer that stopped all traffic RIGHT before an exit were about to get off of. We sat parked on the highway for 3 hours... it was crazy.  We then ate at this quaint little Friendly's in NY; I think three of us had this meatloaf platter thing because it came with a free sundae.  Finally, after we made it back and dropped Dan off, we hung out in Boston for the rest of the weekend (after a solid 5 hours of sleep).  Wow, it's already been almost 2 months since then.  Time sure flies.  Speaking of time, I should finish putting up those pix and get to my schoolwork.
