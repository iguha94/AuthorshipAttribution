         This is my first real journal entry in a while.  How did it become early Thursday evening already?  It still feels like I just got back from Chicago.  What've I done this week? I've cooked for people, I've read a very little bit (not nearly as much as I woudl have wanted), watched Rocky, Citizen Kane, and High Fidelity, chatted a bunch, hung out a little, played video games, and slept a lot as well.  Rocky.  I loved it for seeing parts of Philly that I recognize, the great acting, and the camera work.  It is definitely the best of the series, they should have just left it at the first one.  Citizen Kane.  It's always been curious to me as to how a movie should be picked to be the number one movie of an entire century, so I decided to see what the fuss is all about.  To be honest, I thought it would be a boring, stiff old movie, but what I got was a vibrant, fast-paced, complex drama.  I think I can see why critics would eat this movie up... good acting, well written script, revolutionary camera work and special effects (for the time... the special effects were good because you really don't notice them, so they really do succeed as special effects), etc.  It was a very deep and meaningful movie, and I'm still trying to piece together what it was trying to say about the heart and motivation of man.  High Fidelity.  I wouldn't have enjoyed nearly as much as I did, had I not visited Chicago this past week.  I recognized a lot of the sights and the feel of the city, so that was a big bonus.  The casting was really well done, especially the music store workers.  I wish the movie didn't discuss sex so blatantly as much, but I think it did work in a way.  The culminating marriage proposal speech by Cusak was very interesting, and I found myself relating to what he was saying.  Ok, that's all I'll say about those movies.
