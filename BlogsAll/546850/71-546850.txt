         One struggle these days:  reading the Word.  It's a bitter struggle to do it, and I am not sure why. This is how it's a struggle:  Competing Thoughts  Things that I haven't even considered to think of during the day crop up, and they're usually such petty things, like, "I need to shave now," or "My fingernails are getting a bit long."  When I really think about it, why do these thoughts and concerns appear to be so important as soon as I start to read the Word?  But, when they come, in my mind they become almost an absolute necessity.  I have to bitterly fight and pray to get them out.  Sadly, these days they usually win after, at most, half an hour.  Competing Desires and Feelings  These are closely linked with competing thoughts, but these usually don't necessarily come in the form of thought (though they usually manifest themselves in that way).  These usually happen when I am first considering about reading the Word, or as I'm trying to get into it.  I feel a very strong desire to do something else, or, simply to dwell in my feelings at the moment rather than focus on what's being said.  Honestly, I don't know why I've become like this.  Maybe I've been like this for much longer.  Regardless, my short attention span has greatly hampered my relationships with God, family, and friends, as well as my studies.  However, I do also know that God made me this way and that He has a purpose for this, one of the most obvious being the lesson of being Theo-dependent vs. Self-dependent.  What does it mean to be dependent upon God?
