         "Weekend of Travel, Tribulation, and Lessons"  Friday night, I drove up to sleep over Jimmy Choi's house in Old Tappan.  Jon Chu was coming into NYC late that night, so we drove in to NYC.  Along the way, as we were engrossed in conversation, we ran through a blinking red light so a cop pulled us over.  It was such a dampener for the moment... it's also Jimmy's birthday, you know?  We stopped by Grey's Papaya to pick up some hot dogs (mustard and sauerkraut yum!), and had some interesting conversations about ministries... about the issue of authority, and how all of the problems in church history always stem from the issue of authority:  who has it?  Where is it?  Problems arise when leaders try to assume too much authority over the members of the church, instead of directing them to the Scriptures.  Well, I can go more into that, but I don't remember enough to explain... but it definitely makes sense, if you think about it.  After we slept, I drove back home the next morning.  I rested a little, then tried to go to my roommates' church's picnic, got lost, and had to go back home because I was getting picked up for the Steven Curtis Chapman concert in Philly.  We met up with some people, got cheesesteaks @ Tony Luke's (2nd best in city, supposedly... I thought it was realllly good), and went to the concert.  It was in Temple University's Gymnasium... I met up with the Hopkins crew.  So awesome.  Jane Park had also come from Chicago; she had a ticket to come to NY this weekend, so she spent time with Brian.  They both came, and that was a pleasant surprise.  The concert was just incredible, I'll write more later. Too tired right now.  Tribulation & Lessons:  I'm a worse driver than I thought I was, and I got lost for the first time in my life today.  Jersey roads are a lot more tricky than any other roads I've had to drive through in other states...  So many things that happened these past two days that I have to pray and think about.
