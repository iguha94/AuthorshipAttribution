         What do you do when it feels like your entire consciousness is within the confines of a relentless vise, restricting you from performing any constructive duty?  Do you pray? Do you sleep?  Every time I sit down to do homework for the past couple of weeks, that's my experience.  I've prayed.  I've tried to preach the Gospel to myself.  I've proclaimed the Truth of Christ's Sovereignty.  Why is my heart and my mind so slow on the uptake? Why can't I get it? It's a frustrating cycle: I try to do work, get distracted or can't sit still, I end up not getting assignments done, I get frustrated, I try to do work, my frustration distracts me, I can't do the backed up work on top of the current assignment.  Once again, I've shut off my computer at home to keep myself from wasting time at home.  Once again, I've been trying to limit social outings for the week so that I can focus on studying.  Once again, I end up moping around the library instead of fighting my emotions.  It's times like now that show me how weak I can be.  It's times like these that show me that I don't have any power within me to resist my body.  Then, God, where is Your Strength? Why am I still caught in this cycle?  Why is it still so difficult for my heart and soul to grasp and be motivated by Your Grace?
