         Sprint it is.  Oh! There's this weird deal, for this week and the next, that they're giving out 6000 free minutes for nights and weekends, to be used for the next six months if you get it online.  Phone:   LG 1010   Something I was thinking about today.  Maybe it's a waste of thought, but I was wondering, how can one describe the feeling of liking or "falling in love" with someone?  How does one qualitatively describe the feeling?  It's easy to describe other emotions, like happiness.  Happiness is the state where one thinks and has positive feelings, is it not?  But when you like someone, there's this one specific feeling that I just can't find a way to put into words.  I feel it in my chest; maybe I can say it's like muted excitement.  It includes an overwhelming sense of longing to be with the person in question; there's that really strong sense of adoration for the person, regardless of perceived imperfections.  I wish I can say the word 'longing' would be another way to put it, but there's still more to it.  Maybe it can be described as this:  romantic feelings are when you feel pleasure, excitement, desire, concern, and the rest of your emotions in response to the person in question.  I have no idea why I was thinking about this, besides the fact that I'm a very emotional/sentimental type of person.  Too much so, in which I find myself rendered stupid when overcome by them.  Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.  How can we humans feel the same way about God?  About Someone we can't perceive with our physical senses?  Yet, God desires that for us.  How can I feel pleasure, excitement, desire, longing for God, in the same and even in a more intense manner than I do with romantic interests?
