         today was similar to yesterday.  woke up. spent time in 1 john.  did errands, watched tv, cooked & ate, watched more tv, more errands, and already it's ~10:00 PM.  I still haven't been able to start my job search yet, and it's already july.  how am i going to find a job quick?  temp?  i don't even have a car.  arg.  creation festival.  so, an interesting about it was, that friday I got to attend this outdoor youth worker q&a session with deliriou5.  I sat in front with my brother, taking pictures with his camera.  the funny thing is, it started to rain a little, so they all moved up in their chairs until they were about 2 feet away from us.  pretty cool.  very interesting questions asked and very well answered.  they played well that night... and with the added availability of the huge video screens, they incorporated some visual elements too.  very well rehearsed, i might say.  the one thing that i found strange all throughout the festival was that i was very disinterested and emotionally detached from everything going on...  I even tried to get into it at times, but it just didn't feel right.  one thought that kept coming through my mind was actually a struggle of mine that i've been dealing with since... oh... probably the middle of first semester senior year, last fall.  it's a little private, and i haven't told anyone what it is, but it's not been really good.  it's a feeling that i can't shake, and it has been sparking really bitter feelings.  God, i just can't get over this.  that compounded with the events of this past year, as well as graduating from college, has built up now and for the past half of the year i've found myself a lot more self-centered, unhappy, and not as passionate in my relationship with God.  I just want to handle this well.  how do i surrender all of this to christ?
