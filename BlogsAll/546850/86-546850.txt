         Ok, I lost my good post.  I'll try to recall what I wrote.  It seems that the best way to honor those who died is to snub the terrorists' hope to instill fear in us... to snub it by living without fear, by living with courage.  It's easy to live in fear, but we who are in Christ don't have to.  In fact, we're called to do something different:  "Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God." - Colossians 3:1  This brings to life the well-remembered parable about the wise man building his house upon the rock.  Regardless of how we are assaulted by the storms of our emotions, there's a greater Truth that keeps us standing.  The solidarity of historical event and the promise of life from the most trustworthy person are enough for us to face our irrational fears and emotions and fight with a strength that is not our own.  Establishment upon the Rock enables us to look above and to hope in the promise of Life.  "Therefore,  since we have been justified through faith , we have peace with God  through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And  we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God . Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces  perseverance ; perseverance,  character ; and character,  hope . And  hope does not disappoint us , because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us." - Romans 5:1-5  What will you listen to?  What will determine if you will be left standing or broken on the ground?  Will it be the waves and storms of emotion, or the solid Rock in which you are planted?
