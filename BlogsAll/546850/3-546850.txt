         Dag. It's already 11 PM.  This evening is a prime example of how I end up handing assignments late, etc. etc. After review session, I got back here around 8:30.  Since then, I've done nothing. I started to read something on the net, and chat a little, and next thing i know, it's an hour past. So, I thought I would be a little more productive and focus on practicing guitar.  Didn't work so well, because I kept reading the   series of articles  I was reading.  The worst part is, they were not important.  Stupid pieces of humor that really contributed nothing to my brain except a good laugh.  Maybe for 10 minutes, that's fine.. but for over an hour? Not good.  I finally snapped to it and focused; I worked on my strumming regimen: endurance, syncopation, and the combination of both.  Man, it's tough to keep learning and developing.  But hey, I gotto keep working at it.  Anyhow, so, it's 11 and I need to get studying for my midterm on Wednesday, as well as other stuff.  One thing I'm hoping I can get done before I graduate:  a personal art project that is a culmination of all I've learned so far artisically and with my engineering stuff.  Dunno what.  Maybe a song.  Maybe something visual.  Maybe something both.  Or, maybe nothing at all.  Boring life?  Maybe. So sue me.
