         Yesterday, I didn't post because I was obsessed with my new video card.  It's working quite nicely, though it doesn't allow me to do one thing that I'd hoped it could do: DVD frame captures.  That's how I got that A.I. picture from my previous post.  However, I found that my older brother's laptop can do it, so all is well.  A.I. has so many incredible shots, so I sat there last night taking shot after shot of eye candy.  I don't know why I'm obsessed with art, in the general sense.  I love the arts in general, the ability to express truths and beauty.  I love, in images, when things lines up, or colors are rich and alive.  I love it in music when the emotion and the thoughts are expressed not just in lyric but in the arrangement, the way the players passionately play.  Yet, I still can't produce a full work on my own.  I guess that's why I haven't always been the happiest person, in some ways, because I created that expectation of myself and still haven't met it.  It's a bit too self-centered to be of any merit, I admit.  I think when I start to really explore God more, things will start to flow out more naturally :-).  The problem is that I still let myself get too distracted with stupid stuff like cheap entertainment, but it's a work in progress, and I'm getting there.  Cheers.
