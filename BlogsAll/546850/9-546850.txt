         Since 4:00, I've basically reverted to my natural self... the lazy, whimsical, and unfocused individual.  I've just been drifting around all day (for 7 hours!)... fiddling with the guitar, talking to people online, cooking dinner, giving guitar lesson, then coming here to the library to study. Of course, I didn't get any studying done.  I've been socializing with people I've not had the chance to talk to in a while, so that's good.  However, when I sat down to study, my mind was abuzz and I just could not sit still.  It happens a lot and I think it's a sign that I'm not really in a good environment to study.  No wonder my productivity schedule has always been focused on those last minute cram sessions.  Lack of discipline has always been a weakness of mine that I have yet to conquer, but I know it's something God has been calling me to and enabling me to battle.  On the topic of God, a struggle I've been having recently is the timeless battle of applying what I read and digest from the Word to my life... the question of how I can get my heart and soul to grasp what I know in my mind.  This subject came up in a recent conversation with Amanda from Wellesley, and it's interesting how she brought it up at a time in which I've been thinking about what it really means to worship lifestyle.  I've been studying Ecclesiastes, and I'm again brought to that place that I often get to in my walk... how do I heed the instruction of the Teacher?  "The conclusion when all has been heard is to fear God and keep His commandments," the recurring theme of the purpose of man: to enjoy the gifts of God and to enjoy worshipping Him, the warning to "let your words be few" as you approach God. How can I really live this out? It sure takes a lot of discipline...  More on this later.  Time to go home and sleep.
