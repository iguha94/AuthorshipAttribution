         When I said it's REALLY time to go study, I packed up my stuff and headed off to pick up a bite to eat, visit Angela along the way (to deliver a letter to her from Jane), and go study.  What really happened:  I got my food, realized I had forgotten the letter, and ended up talking to Angela for half an hour. Of course, by then I had to go to praise team practice.  So basically, today was really not study day.  But, bible study at practice on Luke 13:1-9 was very eye-opening and humbling.  In short, what I personally got out of it was that Christ always was making the point of what real spiritual people are like. 1) They are broken and humble; they're willing to admit their absolute need for God. 2) After they receive His blessing, they respond by constantly returning to Him in thankfulness and by constantly striving to do His will. Both characteristics are extremely hard to come by; I can attest to that personally.  I don't really admit my need for God until something bad happens. And, after I cry out for His help and receive it, I find myself instantly forgetting about what He did and just go back to being my old self.  I'd try to give an example right now, but this post is long enough as is...   email  me if you want me to elaborate.  So, yeah... I really got a lot out of it... thanks Edmund for leading it.  Your bible studies always stimulate my heart and mind.  Afterwards we ate at Chile's.  Gyju presented her idea for a night where the praise team members would present their own personal take on what praise and worship really is, why they're in the team, and what God's been doing through this calling... interesting. I like. Go Gyju.  Ok. Good night.
