         Hello everyone.  Nothing much happened today, so I will not write about what I did today.  I have been working on homework and going to class today, so I didn't think about much today.  Therefore, there isn't much to say about what I did up to this point in time.  However, tonight my dad's coming down again to continue his series on systematic theology for my older brother's small group.  And tonight, I will be attending to some matters of extreme importance.  But for now, it is time to study and to prepare for tonight.  My friend, on her blog, brought up her fears about slipping into "a routine" in life.  As for me, I'm the total opposite:  I have no real routine.  Yes, regular class schedule and things to attend to, but there's no set time that I must get up to commute to work.  In fact, I have often found myself wanting to be in a good, disciplined routine where I can maximize my study, spiritual, and play times.  But, reading about her fears makes me wonder: is that what I want?  Rather, will my life be all the better if I have this rigid schedule to follow every moment?  Maybe it will.  Maybe I'll get things done in time.  Maybe I'll be less emotionally unstable, since I'll be on top of things.  But I ask... who is really on top of things in this world?  Just wondering.  Anyhow, like I said, it's time for me to study and to prepare for tonight.
