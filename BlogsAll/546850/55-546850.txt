         After living on my own without work or many responsibilities for the past couple of months, I've come to see the following things:  1) I have the unexhaustible tendency to be lazy, shirking what little responsiblities I have to do what I feel like at the moment.  2) Due to that constant lifestyle of instant gratification, my ability to concentrate and keep a well-sustained train of thought has dwindled.  The perpetual option of choice offered by TV and the internet has trained my mind to need a rapid, changing medium in order to keep its interest on something.  3) I still have been able to do some good thinking, and I've been meditating on the seeds of some of my bad habits and addictions.    One fault I have is an intense fear of others' opinions, as well the fear of "the unknown."  I'm not sure where they all came from, but I remember having them since early childhood.  I remember going to a birthday party with a gymnastics theme; I think I was in third grade, and upon arrival, everyone was at the big trampoline.  Well, I was terribly frightened, because while I was small and scrawny, everyone seemed to be well coordinated and physically fit.  Therefore, since they were all doing all these fancy tricks, here was scrawny, nerdy old me, I lied and complained that I had a headache and wanted to sit down.  Of course, after 5 minutes, I was bored, and I decided to play by myself in the obstacle course on the other side of the gym.  Instances like that typify the initial response I have to deal with internally when faced with high pressure, like when I step into the employment office of a company to get a part time job, or meet my professor for research, etc.  I'm learning to recognize when I'm caught up in those fears, but it's still an uphill battle to say no to all of it.  I guess those tendencies led to my passive tendencies, as well.
