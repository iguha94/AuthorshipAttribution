         Today I finally got a temp job from a school... God surely has provided.  I've been getting having really annoying conversations with my mother lately... she really knows how to push the exact buttons to tick me off sometimes.  I must admit, there are problems in myself these days that I have realized only because of these unpleasant conversations with my mom.  For the past year, I've slipped into this state of unmotivation, where I've listened to my body, my emotions, and my whims, allowing them to control my actions and my life.  It hasn't been really happy, either, and I've been shirking a lot of responsibilities.  This is a little hard right now to describe, but it just feels like there's a vise tightening my chest every time I talk with my mother.  However, I think there's even a worse sort of vise tightening around my life, as I haven't really been passionately pursuing God... it's a worse because it's subtle in its lack of any negative sensation.  However, I find myself feeling hollow and listless all the time these days.  Things that used to excite me about God don't excite me as much anymore, and I find myself starting to delve into things that really don't please Him... things that cater to old sinful passions that I've struggled with for so long.  Jesus, please, rescue me from this body of death.  Anyhow, even better news.  Rutgers sent me information about the $20,000 in loans I will have if I go next year.  WHAT THE HECK? The BME Department said that they'd pay for my tuition... AND, they would pay me a stipend, but I've received -$40,000 from what they promised.  I don't get this.  But, God is good, and I know that He's doing this to get me off my lazy butt and start taking care of business that I should have taken care of a while ago, but was too lazy and unmotivated to do.  Once again, Jesus, transform me... thank you for doing all this to show me how.
