         Small group today once again reminded me of how little my fear is of God, particularly of His wrath.  It's a humbling realization to see how little I really do believe in my heart what I know in my mind... it's even more humbling to see that it's largely due to my error in thinking that knowing spiritual truths is equal to knowing them genuinely in my heart.  How do I personally follow Christ?  Christian tag lines like "die to self every day" sound so convicting, but have you, have I, have we fallen into the trap of being content with just verbally repeating to ourselves?  Anyhow, us four guys in the small group have picked things to keep each other accountable until we meet on Wednesday morning at 7 AM.  Yogi will journal his quiet time every day, Scott will read The Two Towers, James will do his 15 page paper, and I will do my homework and not use my computer.  The problem with that last one is, I now have a real reason to open my computer that I had forgotten about when I made that pact:  there are a lot of emails with important dates that I have to write down on my calendar, and they're all saved on my computer.  DANGIT.  What do I do? This is important.  I have to write down my dates for my FAFSA appointment, lunch with professor, getting tickets for graduation, etc.  God, please, help me figure out a solution.  Supervised usage?
