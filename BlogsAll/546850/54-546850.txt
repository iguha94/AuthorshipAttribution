         In reading "Knowing God" this morning, I was humbled by the following quotes:  "We need frankly to face ourselves at this point.  We are... orthodox evangelicals.  We can state the gospel clearly... smell unsound doctrine a mile way.  If asked how one may know God, we can at once produce the right formula:  that we come to know God through Jesus Christ the Lord, in virtue of his cross and mediation, on the basis of his word of promise, by the power of the Holy Spirit, via a personal exercise of faith.  Yet the gaiety, goodness, and unfetteredness of spirit which are the makers of those who have known God are rare among us혰rarer, perhaps, than they are in some other Christian circles where, by comparison, evangelical truth is less clearly and fully known. "  "A little knowledge  of  God is worth more than a great deal of knowledge  about  him."  "All very fine혰yet interest in theology, and knowledge  about  God, and the capacity to think clearly and talk well on Christian themes, is  not at all the same thing as knowing Him. "  "We must learn to measure ourselves, not by our knowledge about God, not by our gifts and responsibilities in the church, but by how we pray and what goes on in our hearts.  Many of us, I suspect, have no idea how impoverished we are at this level. Let us ask the Lord to show us."  *hand raised*  I have no idea the full extent how impoverished I am, but I know that at least to some degree of understanding, I'm pretty darn impoverished.  "It is those who have sought the Lord Jesus till they have found him혰for the promise is that when we seek him with all our hearts, we shall surely find him혰who can stand before the world to testify that they have known God."  Can I really stand and testify? It's time, again, to start seeking Him with all my heart.
