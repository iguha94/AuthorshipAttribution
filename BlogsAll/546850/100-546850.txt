         ANNOUNCEMENT/REQUEST  Does anyone that reads this site live in New York?  For those that do, do you know any christian female that needs a roommate?  I have a friend that is moving from Chicago to work in CT, but she wants to live in NY.  She would like to live with a good Christian sister, if she can.  If you do, please leave a comment about how she can get connected.  Yes, Mr. Gentyle, Kangles are being worked, but this time not for me.  Please, no comments concerning "kangling." :-) **** Everywhere you go, people complain.  There's always something to complain about, something to be dissatisfied about.  All the conversations I find myself getting to lately involve me listening to complaints: "This sucks", "this professor is a jerk", "I don't have money", etc.  I just wonder, why do people complain?  To me, it seems to be done to gain sympathy and attention, in order to affirm self-importance/self-righteousness.  Complaints essentially say, "This isn't the way things should be, I deserve more."  Complaints are a declaration of ones' self-importance, aren't they?  The sad thing about all of this is that people find more pleasure in complaining instead of praising.  We seem to be so much more content about finding the faults in our environments versus rejoicing in their perks.  Another "why":  Why do we tend to enjoy looking at the negative more than the positive?
