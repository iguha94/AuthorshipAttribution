         "I never would have guessed that I would forgive and eventually love the man that had killed my father."  - paraphrase,   Steve Saint , at the Steven Curtis Chapman concert in Philly a couple of weeks ago.  I recalled this today through the most random thought process.  It started when I read on someone's website that she was going to go to Philly, and wanted to eat cheesesteaks.  That called, to my mind, Tony Luke's, the best I've had so far (but that doesn't say much, since I only had Geno's and Pat's, the mediocre touristy ones).  That called to mind the weekend that I ate Tony Luke's.  That called to mind the concert.  That called to mind the emotion and message of the night.  That brought about shame, because I had already forgotten, so quickly, about the Gospel, and that example that night of how it changes lives.  Read the story on the   website  I have linked up.  Something else on my mind.  It's been said to me that it's sometimes very frustrating to read this journal, because I always analyze but I never do.  You're right.  It's because I'm too sensitive to my emotions, not persistent enough to fight them in order to get something done, regardless of how I feel.  That's something I've always had a problem with; that's what I have to work with.  Ok.  Well, I have to go study.  Arriveducci.
