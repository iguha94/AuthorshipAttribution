         On romantic relationships, and to those like me who aren't in one.  A lot of theorizing and idealizing gets you no where if you're not building up whatever current relationships you are in, friendship or not.  God is soveriegn and will lead you into a relationship when He does.  If you're not in one now, stay content and continue to build up your skills in conflict resolution, communication, and generosity.  "Why is it that every girl I've been interested in has either not shared the same interest in me or not been interested in entering a relationship of any sort?  What is wrong with me?  Is it that I'm so immature, that I can't manage my time or prioritize wisely?  What is that overall unattractive quality about me?  Insecurity?"  Really, that's what I feel constantly, but I try to fight those feelings.  God's working on me, and He's guiding me... Those were all self-centered thoughts, and that's why they're not to be dwelt upon.  Every person and every couple is different.  We all come together in different ways, and that's why I think it's impossible to set generalize-able hardand fast rules of dating.  What matters is prayerfulness, honesty of character, and a God-ward focus in life.  If you really practice those things,  the Holy Spirit's wisdom will guide you fully and sufficiently to deal with any feelings you have with someone.  Lord, help me to deal with these feelings that still rage so strongly with in me.  Give your wisdom, Lord... give me your peace...
