         I've had this concern before.  I still haven't done anything much about it.  Honestly, I don't know what I can do.  I've been addicted to the computer and to the Internet for so long now.  It has claimed so much time out of my life, it's kept me from being productive.  Rather, my addiction has, not the internet nor computers themselves.  Honestly, I don't know what I can do.  I've tried so many things.  I've tried to go cold turkey, in college, but that became an impossibility due to classes requiring the use of special programs for assignments, as well as important emails.  I want to get rid of this addiction. I have to.  This is just ridiculous, the amount of time I spend reading useless things on the web.  I find myself turning the computer on, or going to computer for NO REASON at all.  I just open up IE, and sit there, trying to think of things to type into Google to read up on, trying to go online and see who there is to talk to.  This is pathetic.  This is sad.  This is scary, because so much of my life has been wasted, I still waste it, and I know in the future so much of my time will be wasted.  Honestly, I don't know what I can do, but pray, and try to fix it, yet again.  This really stinks.
