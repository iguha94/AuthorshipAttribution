         Today: 1) What I did today.  2) Things I noticed.  1) So, during and after waking up and taking a shower, I spent my thoughts praying.  It was good to catch up on praying for people whom I'd promise to pray, for my church, and for other things.  After that, I did the final stage of cleaning the carpet: sprinkling the deodorant and vacuuming.  Afterwards, my brother and I went shopping again for the barbecue we had tonight.  We also got our cable receiver replaced because our old one was going haywire.  It was fun firing up the grill (actually, 2 small grills) with the charcoal, lighter fluid, etc.  We had hot dogs, barbecue chicken, mashed potatoes, "sahm gyup sahl" (thinly sliced pork belly) and sliced ribeye, chicken caesar salad, and almond tofu/fruit mix.  2) The new thing I encountered today was the multiple "Spanish" categories in the nearby Pathmark (a chain of supermarkets in NJ and PA area.)  It was strange... some aisles would list a couple of items, and then have "Spanish" displayed above.  I really didn't see much a difference in the aisles besides a couple of items, like maiz for tortillas in the flour section and a section devoted to Goya products.  (Does anyone remember the "Goya... oh boy-a!" commercials?)  I forgot how drivers in NJ are a lot worse than Baltimore drivers... they cut you off a lot more and they don't really obey traffic laws.  Be careful if you go through NJ... at least, the local roads.  I've become anti-social now.  It's just too draining now to put energy into forming new friendships and relationships.  What happened to me? When all of my brother's and roommates came over today, as well as throughout the week, I just smiled politely and then went back to doing whatever I was doing.  What a great impression I must be leaving on everyone.  What happened to the excited, social butterfly that I was during freshman and sophomore year?  So, that's what I've done and noticed today.
