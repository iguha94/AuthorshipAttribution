         New U2 compilation coming out: Best of 1990-2000.  Only for you 90's kids, seeing as most people that grew attached to 80's U2 don't really like 90's U2.  To me, it's all the same to me at the core, I guess that's why I like them.  I previously posted the first line of the following lyric; now you can read the whole thing:    Moby  (though, the lyrics are sampled from gospel recordings)   In This World   "Lordy don't leave me All by myself  Good time's the devil I'm a force of heaven  Lordy don't leave me All by myself  So many time's I'm down Down down  With the ground  Lordy don't leave me All by myself  Whoa, in this world  Lordy don't leave me All by myself"  From   Radiohead's   Fake Plastic Trees , a song about disillusionment with the world of mass marketing and mass consumption, with our obsessions of image.  I'm relating to the disillusionment I experienced when my expectations and reality didn't meet on the street.  I won't stay down, but it sure helps to understand how I feel, so that I can fight it.  "She looks like the real thing She tastes like the real thing My fake plastic love  But I can't help the feeling  I could blow through the ceiling If I just turn and run   And it wears me out, it wears me out It wears me out, it wears me out    And if I could be who you wanted If I could be who you wanted  All the time, all the time "  Back to studying biochem.
