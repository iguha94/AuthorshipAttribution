         Today I went to Philadelphia to visit Jin Choi, my friend from high school, and to visit UPenn to see what it's like.  After all, Jin is a senior there, so everything worked out nicely.  After I got there, I hung out at his dorm a little, then went to eat at Philly Diner.  I got this grilled chicken thing, it was pretty good.  I'm convinced now that all diners have the same distributor or something, since every dish I've had at every diner I've eaten have this diner "taste."  Dunno how to describe. It's not bad, not good, just distinct.  I had parked at a meter (25 cents for 15 minutes... what a ripoff!), so all day I had to keep checking the time and feeding the meter. It was a bit annoying for me, but oh well.  I hope it didn't inconvenience them; I got a couple good quick convo's with Jin.  After all, we hadn't seen each other for four years.  Yay. It was a great time.  After the diner, we got ice cream (thanks Christina Kim for buying it; though I doubt you'd ever read this, I thought I'd give credit where it's due) at this new supermarket nearby, fed my meter, checked out the Penn Bookstore, checked email at the VanPelt Library, stopped at Douglas' (a cosmetic store that Amy Park (is that your last name?) wanted to check out), fed my meter, and stopped back at Jin's dorm.  Amy needed some help with her physics lab, and during that time I made the discovery that her lab partner is this guy that was in my high school youth group.  *sniff* these kids, all grown up and gone to college....    So, afterwards, I left.  What a quick 4 hours, I tell ya... it felt like I just got there, and now I had to leave. Oh darnit. Traffic was thick, and I missed an exit... so I ended up going past my old neighborhood again, 2nd time in one week.  So weird.  Oh, so, at the bookstore, I was telling Jin and Amy about this funny little clip I had of a penguin, so   here it is .  Enjoy!
