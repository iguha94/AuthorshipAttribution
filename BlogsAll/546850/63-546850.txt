         Tonight I hung out with my roommates at Stelton Pizza.  Man, I miss good ol' NJ/NY pizza.  Nothing in the world like it... eating NJ/NY pizza during my childhood was what got me hooked on Italian.  Yes, it's my favorite style of food.  Yes, I'm Korean.  No, Korean isn't my favorite (and don't get on my case about it).  Not to say I don't like Korean food, but I have more of an Italian taste.  We watched The Royal Tenenbaums.  Very sweet, very quirky, I liked it a lot, I found myself laughing a lot... but sadly, at places where no one else in the room laughed.  It was quite embarrassing.  I liked the music selection, as well... Charlie Brown themes, the Ramones, etc. Very eclectic.  I realized this earlier tonight:  I have a very driven and motivated mindset, but I'm very lazy and easily distracted, so I'm frustrated all the time.  Either, I lower my standards, or start trying to meet them.  Go visit   www.dyske.com .  I have him linked up.  He has some very interesting articles.  I liked "Instruction Manual for Youth" parts one and two, as well as his "Dyske the Brand" campaign.  There are many choices in life we make, and the most fundemental choice being what we believe in... because what we believe in defines the direction and purpose of our lives.  Are you sure what truths you hold dear to are really worth holding dear to?
