         Today was my church youth group pastor's last Sunday, so afterwards we stopped by Applebee's for dessert.  A lot of us ordered milkshake. Strange, for some reason, I downed mine in a second, but everyone else wasn't as enthusiastic, so I ended up drinking lot more milkshake.  Afterwards we went to the park to play ball.  All my Hopkins peeps reading this must be surprised, since I never play.  But, it was for my youth group kids, and I decided what the hey.  I played a lot better than I have done in the past, but man... I wasn't feeling so well. I started to get light-headed and dizzy, so I drank a lot of water and laid down on one of the benches.  It must have been the milk shakes.   Afterwards, I drove my mom home, and she gave me a haircut.  For some reason, she really likes my massages (most people cringe in howl in pain because I of my grip, but my mom likes it for some reason), so I gave her a massage.  Poor mom, she's sometimes having weird episodes of slightly losing motor control... some parts of her body start spazzing out.  Not in any extreme way, but her muscles sorta tighten up.  The thing that stinks is, we don't currently have insurance.  Kinduva transition period.  Man.  So, my bro and I got some food, and headed back.  We had a good talk about running the youth group, basketball, and tomorrow's cell group.  Since getting back, I've been talking online and setting down what I want to do this week.  What I thought about during the car rid home:  Multi-talented people really aren't multi-talented, they're really good at one thing: drive.  They have the drive to learn, the drive to meet an ideal.  So, naturally, when they turn to different areas of interest, they get really good at them.. but it all goes back to just being proficient at pursuing their ideals.  I'm not sure if that communicated exactly what I was thinking, but oh well. That will do.
