         This past weekend has been one crazy weekend.  Thursday, after getting up at like... 1? and studying all afternoon, Rena took me out to dinner for my birthday.  Afterwards I went to small group at Scott's, but no one showed so I ended up giving Adam Jackley, his roommate, some guitar lessons. That night I stayed up in a desparate but failed attempt to finish my dynamics homework.  I woke up, prepared for Friday worship, went to class, then to church, then back, then practiced guitar, then slept. Man. What a short day.  Then. Saturday, I went to praise band practice.  And, it turns out, they forced me (well, not necessarily forced, but I just wasn't planning...) to go to Lois' recital. Then, at the reception, we had to wait there forever. I was kinda getting annoyed because I still had that assignment due... to make matters more interesting, when we got back to my place, I saw Jimmy Choi's car parked outside.            "Jimmy Choi? What's he doing here?" I didn't get it.  What was he doing down at Baltimore again? So, we go up, and what do you know, they were holding the door shut.  So the guys with me and I were pushing to get in, and well, when I got in, the lights were all off, but I felt this big squishy thing bounce off of my chest, and heard, "SURPRISE."  As well, "Happy Kwanzaa!", "Happy Veteran's Day!", and other holidays (it's a long story, ask me if you want to know what it means).  Wow. A suprise party!  And they got me these really nice speakers for my computer, as well as a "Live Drive" in which I can plug in my guitar and any other sound source! That was a totally unexpected, shocking gesture. I am still in shock. And I'm very grateful.  Well, except for the 3 times they violated me that night, and except for Jimmy showing everyone the embarassing Adoremus Concert Video from freshman year, the rest of the night was filled with much laughter and joy.  It was a great time, and I'm just so thankful that God has blessed me with such great people.  For pix of the evening, check out   Jimmy's site .  At any rate, I ended up tossing and turning that night until it as already time for sunrise service.  I went to the Grace Life Church one, since Hope Chapel didn't have it, I miss everyone there, and I wanted to see how things have changed over the past year.  After service, I ate breakfast, went straight to church, came back, slept for 7 hours, then set up the speakers in my room.  Man. What a weekend.
