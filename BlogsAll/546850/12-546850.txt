         So. I got into both UPenn and Rutgers, yesterday.  Decision making time... I still have to figure out the whole money situation, and I also have to visit.  I don't think I can just decide till Monday... hopefully Hopkins will be able to push my notification date by a week.  I didn't finish that homework I was working on at the Hut (from the previous entry); Danny and I ended up going back to my place to rest, get up early, and finish as much as we could.  Unfortunately, we just ended up taking turns hitting the snooze button on my alarm clock. Danny went home, I went to class, and neither of us finished the homework. Augghh!  Thanks to my lack of sleep, the rest of my day I was in a daze.  I lost track of what we were singing once during praise time, so there was this uncomfortable wait as I found my spot again in the song.  Praise practice went surprisingly well... I worked the mixer and played bass at the same time.  It was much fun...  Today, Jimmy and I picked up free hats and lunch at the Homecoming game.  Man, it was packed.  we're studying in the library right now, though he's gone back home to get his jacket.  Tonight, I'm going to the KSA banquet... there will be pre-frosh there. Doh.  Sigh. My time here at Hopkins is ticking away...
