         For once, I actually woke up at at 7:10 today.  Usually I repeatedly hit the snooze until 8:00, but today only once.  It was good, I actually had time to do a good job of ironing and grooming. At church, I had a great time playing bass... it's just so fun.  Kenny Choi, the speaker today was pretty cool, but I'm not sure what his main point was; commitment is better than dedication?  Know "the religion of your fathers" in your heart, not just in the head?  Anyhow, the message was a character study of Jacob.  He explained the passage—Genesis 28:10-22—of Jacob's dream as he was running away from home, and how that time became the point where dedication to God became a true commitment.  Hm.  when wll that time be for me?  Anyhow, I had the pleasure of eating lunch with the UMAB pharmacy/nursing students today in the fellowship hall.  They're really cool; I hope that these relationships will really become true "iron sharpening iron" experiences...  It's just strange to see how within Hope Chapel, there are so many different worlds.  Some people still don't really know each other—nor the existence of each other—and it sometimes saddens me that they don't make the effort to.  I'm just hoping that over time we'll learn as a whole to branch out and really get to know each other... how can we do that?  Ok. Nap time.  Estoy muy cansado.
