         I got back last night from the library at around 1:30, but I ended up sleeping at 4 AM.  Danny came over to finish coping my class notes, but I think the brunt of the time was spent talking with Jimmy about life these days.  Ah. Life these days.  Well, I got up this morning at 8 and hauled my butt over to prayer meeting.  Prayer meeting was good, we covered a lot of topics and we got to share (well, at least Scott, James Lieu, and I shared) about what were going through afterwards.  When I got back I found that my old roommate John Yoon left a funny message on the machine.  I'd tell you what it was, but you wouldn't really get it unless you knew him.  As Jimmy Choi fondly states, John Yoon is... the Golden Boy.  Anyhow, I will probably be working my butt off today.  James Lieu was just standing here with me in the library as I type this... we just thought up of a plan for his website dedicated to his enormous shoe collection.  We're thinking of calling it... "Lieu's Shoes."  Heh heh.  I'm typing this entry and probably will be doing so for the next couple within the library because I've unplugged my computer at home once again.  I've actually been able to get studying done... hoorah.  Jane Choi, if you're reading this, drink a lot of water and go to sleep.  All that blood gone means no fun, eh?  (For the rest of you reading this entry, click her link on my link section to read about her recent entry about being tired out from blood donation.)  Ok. Eat? Study?  Dangit. Study.
