         Ok. I'm up late, but I still haven't touched my homework.  After the last entry, I went to the library to study, but after I got there, I realized that I had to do my laundry, so I figured I'd just study at home.  Big mistake.  I have done my laundry, but while waiting I worked on a drum loop for this weekend, talked for five minutes on AIM, hung out at Dan and Cyrus' place downstairs, read the paper, talked to Danny Dokko a little on the phone, and sat here reading up on others' pages and lives.  My time went to all of these things, and for the next half hour I'll be folding and putting away my laundry.  What should I have done tonight that would have been the most efficient with my time?  Probably this following blurb would have been ideal:  I should have gone straight home to do my laundry, and opened up my dynamics book and notes at my desk.  Afterwards I would have set my timer for 20 minutes for when I would have to go down to put the clothes into the dryer, and commenced studying.  For the next hour and half, I could have gotten cracking at this assignment.  Then, I'd get my laundry, fold it, study a little more, work on the drum loop a little, then sleep at around midnight.  That's what I am feeling my night should have been like.  Unfortunately, I ended up going for the immediate urge versus sticking to the long term necessity.  Well, that's already passed, and I live only one life... and that's by Grace alone.  God, keep me from being frustrated at my impulsive self, and grant me Your gift of enjoying this life you've given to the fullest.  Please, teach me, make me teachable, that I can be what You want me to be.
