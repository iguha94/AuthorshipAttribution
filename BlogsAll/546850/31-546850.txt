         Brief Rundown of the day: Best Buy/CompUSA/Guitar Center. Errands. Cleaned Room. Yogi's Potluck. Watched Spiderman.  Hey, please read Jacob Lee's Blogs.  They're really good.  Sometimes it scares me about how similarly we think... we've been comparing ourselves to each other since I first met him.  Yes. Mystery in a relationship... that's key.  Do you know why? Think about it... the most important Relationship we can have will always be filled with mystery.  Why else would we have to spend eternity to explore God in all His riches and splendors?  Why else is His supplying of Christ such a resonating Truth? Mystery causes us to desire, explore, create... it pushes us to live. Once we have this Relationship, it sets the tone for the rest of our relationships.  It teaches that God has that same mysterious relationship with all of His children, and that adds mystery to what is happening in their lives. I hope though, that you don't think I'm just extolling this mystic quality called mystery.  It's not a quality... if you want to know what mystery is, read Colossians.  The Mystery of Christ... something to ponder upon.  Note: this blog isn't really well thought out nor organized, please excuse me.  One point I just want to ultimately get out is that everything that's involved with knowing Christ is a mystery, and that's what makes knowing Him so exciting... because we can never fully know Him in all His sovereignty, but at the same time we can fully know Him to our current capacity.  And, that capacity will keep increasing to infinity...
