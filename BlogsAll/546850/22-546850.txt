         Well, today I had my last class, and my mechatronics group successfully made it through all of our trial runs (if we messed up, we would have had points deducted). Yay! The project is done! Well, almost. There's still the write-up.  On the downside of today, I've had this really painful canker sore on the back left part of my tongue.  It makes everything taste bad, I guess the pain I experience associates itself and just ruins the experience of eating.  I took this test because I saw it on Amy Kim's site.  Ames, I got the exact same thing you did.             which children's storybook character are you?   this quiz was made by   colleen    Tonight, I'll probably end up attending the rehearsal for the jazz band that will be performing for my Intermedia Studio project.  What's the project? We want to increase audience interaction with the musicians; ie, we want to explore different ways they can influence the musicians' emotions.  The audience has the opportunity to select and display a random picture to the musicians, and the musicians in turn respond to the picture.  I still have to finish writing the image selection program, hopefully it will work.  It has to work by this coming Tuesday, the night of the concert.  For those of you in Hopkins area, if you want to attend, we're the final act of the Computer Music Performances, Tuesday night, Griswold Hall in Peabody.  I've also been preparing for Worship Night on Saturday... i've been practicing this   intro  that I recorded last night..  Hope you like it.  As well, hope you can make it this weekend or on Tuesday.
