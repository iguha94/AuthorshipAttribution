         I have been slipping and sliding closer to living like a vegetable, just existing day to day for the next glass of water, the next plate of food, the next thing to please me.  Not such a happy sentiment to listen to or read, is it?  I have to be honest, though.  I do have to say, though, that thought I'm slipping and sliding closer to that state of being, I have been fighting.  I started off this week on a really good note, I got a lot done on Monday and Tuesday.  But quickly again I lost to my feelings of laziness and whimsical mind.  So, the battles have been lost, but the war isn't close to being over.  I've had past burdens on my shoulders:  failed romances, unmet expectations in my academics, art, and whatnot, but life isn't over, it's just begun.  Life begins every day.  I regress a lot, and I lose myself in my feelings, thereby acting in ways that put others in unease (like, during an AIM conversation that I had Thursday afternoon, or being slothful about the dishes, or not commencing on my research), and there's no excuse.  I've sinned, I've failed, but I have a hope in Someone that never does.  I'm not sure where this thoughts are going to take me.  I'm not sure if I'll stay in my low state.  But I will fight, and I will fight by settling with that lack of confidence in my inheritance in Christ.  People ask me what I need prayer for, well, this is it:  I need to deeply dig into the root of my being and settle my fears, my sins, my angsts, my joys, and ask Christ to replace them with His joys, His promises, His truths, and His goodness.  I need to get serious with who I am in this world, in existence, if I'm to live life to the fullest.  I need to get joyous over my state in existence:  I am a child of God.  I am a child of God.
