         The weather has been incredible for the past couple of days in this usually gloomy city...  Yay.   Anyhow, today I had an uncomfortable situation during my group meeting.  I should have been more tactful about the way I did it, but I shot down a group member's idea for our robot and he didn't take it too well.  We ended up arguing about it for about 20 minutes as our 2 members uncomfortably sat working on their own parts of the project.  Naturally, the rest of the time was shrowded with the cloud of tension and I think we were all glad to disband.  During the last part of the meeting, I kept praying for Christ to just take control of my emotions and actions; I don't know if it was visibly so, but my hands were shaking.  That usually happens when I'm placed on the spot; my body gets jittery, my mind shuts down, and I start to stammer.  Explains why I've always had trouble with public speaking, etc.  But anyhow, today's episode was an immediate reminder of my sinful condition... just after my study today on justification.  I was listening to "So We Come" by Jimmy Choi and the words rang true with the study on Romans 1:16-17... We come and worship only by the grace given to us by God, only with Righteousness won by Christ.  To see my instant propensity to sin puts me to shame...  It's interesting how quick God can be in teaching the heart what is known in the mind.  If only our hearts are as quick in learning...  Anyhow, I'm about to find out about my U Penn app.  I called them up and they said they'd call me in 10 minutes.  As well, Rena stopped by with her sister who's visiting, which was cool.   John Kim and John Yoon, my old roommates, are down here as well for the week... it's weird to see them back, but in a good way.  I miss those guys... it'll be like Ivy 300 in the olden days.
