         What a long day.  Yesterday, I brought the carpet steamer back from home to clean the carpet in my brother's (ok, now mine as well) apartment.  It was really dirty and heavily stained, so I decided to do something about it.  I woke up, read the Word, and started to clean at around 12:30 PM.  I didn't know how powerful the detergent "Oxyclean" was, until I used it to spot clean the nasty stuff.  It tooke things out... perfectly. I was really surprised... the spots are totally gone.  Anyhow, afterwards I ran errands with my brother.  We went to Costco... and I'm surprised.  I have never seen so much liquor in my life.  Ros and stacks of beer cases and wine bottles and hard liquor... in Costco? Since when did Costco sell alcohol?  We ate White Castle....  I haven't had it in such a long while.  White Castle, if you've never heard of it, is a small fast food chain, but it's the original chain of restaurants that invented the concept of fast food.  Oh... they're so good, the tiny, ~2.5" X 2.5" square little burgers, with their onion-steamed beef patties, the american cheese, and soft buns... i can eat at least 10 of them at once if i wanted, but I settled for five.  But man. They are so good, I tell you.  We rented Shallow Hal, the recent Ethan Hawke version of Hamlet, and some anime.  I really liked Shallow Hal, because though I expected a silly and mindless movie, it actually was a really humbling thing to watch.  It revealed to me how I think a lot when it comes to girls... ok, so I can be very shallow at times. Ok, a lot more than I'm willing to admit.  Guys really do act more out of their hormones than they realize they do... a lot more than they'd like to admit.  But yeah, I think it's definitely a movie that guys should watch.  As well, Jack Black's a riot... he's such a funny actor.  I'm going to watch Hamlet now.  Let's see how good a job Ethan, Bill Murray, and other pop culture actors can hold up to Shakespeare.
