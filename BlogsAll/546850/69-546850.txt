         Over the past week, I have been reading "The Return of the King,"  the third part of the Lord of the Rings saga by Tolkien.  This guy's a genius, and I think the reason why his works are above the rest of the fantasy fare (besides the fact that he virtually started the whole genre with these works in the first place) is that, well, he created more than a series of tales, he created a whole world.  He made up his own languages, complete with their own alphabets, word structures, etc.  He created a vast historical background for all the events that take place.  He wrote all the poems and whatnot.  Oh, and he wrote the books themselves...  The Lord of the Rings trilogy; it's prequel, the Hobbit;  their prequel, the Silmarillon; Unfinished Tales, and so on.  Volumes and volumes.  After reading the books and watching the movie again, I realize how much I really didn't understand a lot of the nuances here and there when I first saw the movie without reading anything.  There are many nods to the Hobbit in the movie, and there are a whole lot of allusions to what will happen later in the series that I didn't quite pick up.  The books are sometimes hard reads, though, in that they all move very slowly when you first start.  But they do get pretty good as you plod on.  Did anybody know that during the late 60s, the Lord of the Rings received this huge jumpstart of popularity?  It became a big cultural phenomenon.  People would write in subway walls, "Frodo Lives!", and it was sortuva hippie kinda thing (not really popular, but enough to be remembered) to say at the time.  They also generated buttons and bumper stickers and other paraphernalia which proclaimed, "Frodo Lives", "Gandalf for President", and opened new "head shops" with such names as "Middle-Earth", "Hobbit" and "Mithril".  Just some nerdy trivia :-)
