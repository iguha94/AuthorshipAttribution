         Last night I finished the bible study chapter for this morning's small group. It was pretty fitting for what I've been going through recently (see below);  I think one of the best suggestions it had was to go through Romans 6.  Understanding that one is forgiven for sins is one thing... living life in freedom from sin's grasp is another.  I know there's a lot of things that I have problems with, but God's surely working on them.  One thing I noticed that I have to deal with is to cut off my over-dependence upon relationships for emotional support.  It doesn't mean that I want to be a loner now, but God's been showing me how I tend to go to people first with my problems or if I'm feeling lonely, rather than spending time with Him first...  Anyhow, tonight is going to be a busy night of studying.  I'm skipping out on hanging out tonight with Jimmy Su, G, and Jolene at Joe's Crab Shack down at Gaithersburg, MD, in order to get work done.  I have a feeling that Jimmy's not too happy about that... "you better get work done within those 3-4 hours."  He meant it. Sorry Jimmy.  I guess I have have to suck up the consequences for my procastination.  Spring Fair's this weekend, and I may not really go there to have fun... yeah yeah, it's my senior year, but I am so back logged with work that I need all the time I can get to catch up.  I've been waiting for this Saturday's Roots Concert all year, but I may not even end up going...  God, am I just looking at my situation in the wrong light? Am I dealing with things in the wrong way? Give me a better perspective on this...
