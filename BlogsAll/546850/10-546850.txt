         This entry is my 3rd attempt today, since all other attempts were thwarted by slow and bad library computers.  So, yesterday after Jimmy Choi polished off his 50th wing at Bill Bateman's, we returned and hung out at our place.  After some time, he started jamming on my guitar... and yes, one thing led to another, and we started to record some more songs.  2 were instrumentals that I recorded to MD, but unfortunately I erased them by accident later that night.  We then recorded "So We Come," complete with an overdub guitar solo. it was great.  Anyhow, class today was uneventful and I ended up either studying at the library (which I will be doing again soon) and going to office hours.  It's still a struggle for me to get myself working at times, but God is always "providing a way out so that I can stand up to" the temptation of laziness.  It's pretty interesting how He does it... like, today, I took a nap, which I was ok.  Earlier on, I was praying that He'd help me study more efficiently, but when it was time wake from the power nap, I of course didn't want to wake up.  I napped for an extra hour, even though my alarm kept going off every 20 minutes.  My reasoning kept getting worse and worse (I need more sleep, I'll study better later because it'll be more efficient, etc.) until finally, the alarm in our fire escape went off.  Yeah, I couldn't turn that off, and that's when I realized, "Argh. I have no reason to be sleeping so much."  Well, God sure provided a way out, regardless of how I felt, and it was definitely for my good.  Thanks God. Yet again, You've shown how you answer prayer when I least expect You to, but always when I really need it.  Ok, off to the library now to resume studying for the P.D.E midterm tomorrow.
