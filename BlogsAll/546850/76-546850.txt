               From the movie   A.I.     Today was yet another productive/anti-productive day, and our apartment's cable connection has been going haywire until now.  Productive     - Fixed cable connection. I think. I hope.    - Listened to "The Main Thing" again in preparation for leading the praise team practice this weekend, as well as for my personal necessity.    - Spent time setting up the Strat... the intonation was still off and it takes a bit of time to do it, after every re-stringing.    - Figured out a cool guitar sound patch.    - Practiced a song for the praise night.    - Cooked dinner for my brother and I.  Anti-productive     - Woke up at 11:30.  Took two hours to wash up, and waited for the video card.    - Video card never came (though it was sent to be delivered at 8:15 AM), so I went to research lab, sat around for 3 hours doing nothing but browse the web and try to get some code to work, then left.    - Turns out that the video card was delivered right after I left. The didn't leave it, so they deliver it tomorrow.  Go figure.  Yesterday I watched A.I. and went bowling with my roommates and some of their church friends.  A.I. is an incredibly beautiful movie... the cinematography was breathtaking, to say the least.  As for the glaring plot holes and unresolved plot elements, eh.  The great acting redeemed it.  As for the themes, I can see how Stanley Kubrick a movie it was; he likes to explore the perils of technology, the perils of the "progressive thrust" of the industrial age, and perils of trusting in establishements in all of his works.  I think I'm going to watch it again.
