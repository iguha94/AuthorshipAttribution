         Today I sure wasted a lot of time, I feel.  But I got to spend a lot of it chatting with Jyco and some other people; I actually caught up with a friend from high school.  Er, my high school from Philly, not Jersey.  I spent a whole chunk of my day reading up on and selecting my potential courses, as well as trying to find a job and getting an ID card.  I still have to figure out some scheduling thing, I didn't find a job, and I still haven't gotten my ID card yet.  On the plus side, I made pierogies today.  After boiling them to defrost, minced some garlic and a little bit of fresh rosemary,  grated a heaping amount of parmesan and some romano cheeses, and cooked it all up in some olive oil.  So good.  I also cooked mixed veggies and broccoli, for some health.  Later that night, I went out to Applebee's to hang out with some of my roommates' church friends.  Big difference my brother pointed out beforehand to me, and I found out to be true today:  people at Hopkins always joke about how much work and studying we have to do, and have done, but people at Rutgers always joke about how little work and study they really do and still get by.  Talking to my roommate, I found the Rutgers experience vastly different than mine... I never had time to do anything but study, but he had all the time to do anything but study!  Well, I'm glad that I went throught it all.  I sure learned a lot and it really was worth the stress and heartache.
