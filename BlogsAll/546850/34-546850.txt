         After this past post, I went out to eat with my small group.  It was a good time of laughter and sharing, and I'm glad that we had that time.  Scott drove me home, and in that drive we had another good conversation.  Scott is the small group leader, and we've been friends since freshman year.  He's been one of the people here that has most challenged my faith and pushed me to be more authentic, more sincere in the faith.  Afterwards, I drove with Jimmy Su to pick up Jimmy Choi, who was down in Baltimore again to drop off his car.  A drunk driver rear-ended his car and totalled the back end of it.  Jimmy and Shirley, who was in the car with him at the moment, were alright though... thanks God.  We went straight to Geno's in South Philly and got cheesesteaks.  I dabbed on a little bit of hot sauce onto mine, and what a mistake that was.  The sauce wasn't even good, it just caused massive amounts of pain.  I teared up like crazy and it hurt just to eat the cheesesteak.  Let this experience warn the reader to never try the hot sauce at Geno's.  Jean Park, Jimmy's friend, was staying over that night because Jimmy had to drop her off at the airline shuttle.  She had to take the shuttle to the airline because its only terminal is in NYC.  It was a fun evening of watching "The Fast and the Furious," busting out guitars and singing, and just reminiscing about good times over the years.  After sleeping @ 7 AM, waking at 11 and washing up, we went to see Episode II.  It was my second time seeing it, so it was a little boring.  The fact that it didn't have much of a replay factor speaks for itself... sad.  Anyhow, we then dropped Jean off at the shuttle stop.  Jean was very cool, she had a good sense of humor, especially since it was mostly guy sorta humor.
