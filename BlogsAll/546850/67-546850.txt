         Well, I'm going to go off to the first retreat in an hour.  I've never felt comfortable at home, or with my home church. Don't ask why, because I really don't know why either.  I guess the fact that my older brother and I are the only ones in our age range has something to do with it.  Or, maybe it's the fact that I was shoved into the charge of the kids ministry.  Please pray for me, I just don't have a good feeling about any of this.  There's a lot of issues I still have to deal with, like how I'm really uncomfortable with my parents when it comes to discussing spiritual things (which they want to do all the time).  Actually, I'm ok with talking about them with my dad, I think it's just my mother.   +++++++++++++++++++   What is my state of mind right now, but like a rowboat in a whirlpool?  My thoughts are like the eddies traced out by the oars.  Trying to escape, I feel like I'm going in circles through the relentless current.  I want something, but it's not attainable in my eyes.  Is it even what I think it is?  Is the placid water over the whirlpool's rim... placid? Is it there? Maybe I should let the current take me down... to the center, the deep, the dark.  See you all on Sunday.
