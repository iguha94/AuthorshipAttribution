             - Image taken from www.thespark.com  MENTOR ( S  ubmissive   E  xtrovert   A  bstract   T  hinker )  Like just 6% of the population you are a MENTOR (SEAT). Some would call you the most powerful and influential of all people. Those people are wrong.  The reality is that you DON'T really WANT to impose personal views or beliefs on others. Yet you are extroverted and intelligent, and you like to get involved. So you help others with the pursuit of knowledge.  You're the reason that people say, "teachers are also students." You are as much a learner as a master, and this satisfies you.   You won't die a lonely death, but towards the end you'll grow introspective, wondering if your life meant anything. This will last for decades, and you'll die after your spouse.  **** Of all the personality tests I've taken, this one has pegged me pretty much the best.  Submissive, extroverted, abstract, thinker... pretty interesting how that's pretty much on the money.  However, thinking about "Some would call you the most powerful and influential of all people. Those people are wrong.", I wonder.  What if I became more assertive, then, with imposing my views of others?  What if I got good at it?  Then I would be "powerful and influentional."  However, I guess God made me this way to show that He's the one that's so, not me.  Just a thought.  Here's the   link  to the test.
