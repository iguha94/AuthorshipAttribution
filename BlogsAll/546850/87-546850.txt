         I said this on Jacob's site, but I wish I could find musicians around here that I can start jamming with.  I really need an outlet and the experience, otherwise I'll always be a crap musician.  I can trick myself into thinking about all these great musical ideas, but without testing it in a live environment with other people, they can never be tested or shot down.  Anyone out there?  This is my plea for a drummer, bassist, dj, whatever.  ****  Why drag this out? Why not make our peace? Should I take the scalpel and sever our tie? Should I take up the lasso and reign you in? Should I repeat the past and let things fester inside?  Why are things this way: Discomfort for you, Yearning from me?  Who's gonna ride your wild horses? Who's gonna drown in your blue sea? Who's gonna taste your salt-water kisses? Who's gonna take the place of me?  I resonate with Bono's frustrated wail, but I stop and consider: I never had a place with you. You and I were never  we .  What's the use of all my hope? What's the use of all my dreams? You never shared either of them, did you. I always thought that deep down You did. I always hoped that deep down You had the longing. Aren't you glad that you're loved? But, I'm not in the horizon, I'm a burden.  This quicksand called unrequited desire has engulfed me. Will you pull me out? Will I escape and find another? Every moment I battle. Please reconsider. Who else thinks about you daily? Who else prays for you daily? Who else wants you to be happy?  But I reconsider. Do you respect me? Do you see my faults as grounds to turn you off? Would you accept what little I have to give (myself)? Is this enough Will it satisfy  I'm being selfish, aren't I Is this sin Is this hurtful I'll leave you alone, if that's what you want. If it'll bring you happiness If you'll find peace from my absence  Whatever you want. I'm at your mercy. I've always been at your mercy.  God, show me what to do God, show me what to say God, show me the way.
