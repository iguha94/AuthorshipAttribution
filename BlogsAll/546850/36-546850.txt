         Yesterday's pot roast turned out very well.  The meat was tender and juicy, the gravy just right, and the potatoes and carrots were nice and soft.  Khoi and I finished it off very quickly.  Well, we left some for Jimmy, who was at Yogi's playing video games.  How about that game yesterday.  The Kings have been doing a fantastic job at fighting off the Lakers, even if the Lakers have Kobe and Shaq.  On to game 6.  In the meanwhile, hopefully the Nets will beat the Celtics.  Sorry to all of my Wellesley readers who say nay, but my little brother is a big Nets fan, and I wouldn't want him to be heartbroken.  This is the farthest that the Nets have ever gone, ok?  Give them a break.  The Celtics already have some past championships under their belts... and you had Bird!  Be generous. :-D  I'm starting to give up on finding that job.  Well, it's time for me to wash up and go over to the DMC to work on the Adoremus video.  In other news, I am going to try to kick the IM habit, once again.  I was actually doing pretty well at points during the end of the semester, but in the last couple of weeks I've regressed.  Hopefully people will still know about my website.  Maybe I'll just leave up AIM just for the sole purpose of posting my profile up.  Ah, it's excuses like that that keep me online and addicted.  There's much better things to do with my time.
