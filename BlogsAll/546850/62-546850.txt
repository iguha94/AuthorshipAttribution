         To explain why I know I've become too introspective:  I've developed anti-social tendencies in this past year.  I find it hard for me to really relate to people more often than not these days... not because I can't, but because I'm too caught up with what I'm feeling to make the effort.  I've shied away from playing sports with friends, and enjoying activities in groups.  Well, recently, God smacked me in the face with that realization, and led me to see how childish I've become.  I used to have a heart to care for those around me, but these days that twisted into expecting people to do things for me, to accomodate themselves for what I want.  Seeing myself turn into that sickened me, and it sickens me now.  How could I dare say that I believe in His Name?  How could I ever dare to say that I am a child of God, when I have such a self-centered outlook?  God's been very gracious.  "He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God." - John 1:11-13  A question I pose:  What does it mean to "receive Him?"  What does it mean to "believe in His name?"  How you do receive Christ in your heart? What is it that you receive, a concept? Do you just memorize it, and say that you know it?
