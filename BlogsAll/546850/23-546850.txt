         Today has been the beginning of the end, the last Monday of class I'll have here at school.. unless I don't finish all my work.  This is just unbearable, I can't figure out why it's so hard for me to concentrate.  It's been over a month now that I've been having problems again.  Before that I think I was ok in terms of my school work.. in fact, I was really enjoying it.  Math is a real skill that one gets good at with enough practice and thought, just like any other art.  It's just viewed so negatively because people don't always see direct applications for it, but since I'm supposed to be an engineer, it's my job to apply it.  There are so many cool things you can do with math if you really know how to use it... in my class called Dynamic Systems, some applications include modelling car suspensions, understanding how speakers physically work, etc.  Enginerds, unite.  That's great and all, but these past few weeks has been an uphill battle to even get cracking at any of my work.  My homework assignments have not been getting completed—resulting in my slipping grades—so things just aren't going so happily.  After reading Joe Chen's posts, it looks like he and I have much in common.  Joe's a great guy, if you ever get a chance to meet him.   He's a second year med student at Pittsburgh; I know him because he went undergrad here.  He's 2 years above me. Check out his site, the link's to your right.  Later.
