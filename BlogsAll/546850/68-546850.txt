         "There are two colours in my head There are two colours in my head What is that you tried to say? What was that you tried to say? Tried to say.. tried to say.. Tried to say.. tried to say..  Everything in its right place"                                            —Radiohead  I am thinking about revamping my site.  Why fix a site that isn't broken?  Well, it needs a facelift.  I need something that's more original, not a modded version of a Blogger template.  I need something that's tailored to my vision of self-expression.  Ok, that sounded pretentious.  Ok, that was pretentious.  My current thoughts for what the new site will have:  ·Keep a simple interface.  Remember, "Simple is best." ·Different sections:  I'm thinking of, in addition to my journal section, having a tech section in which, from time to time, i will post a "how things work" sorta deal with one of my interests.  For example, how to set the guitar delay to match the style of the Edge from U2 or all the copycat Vineyard/christian music peeps that use it now.  Etc. etc. ·Possibly, a forum.  I'll have to see if i'm allowed to run the cgi stuff on my school server.  Any more ideas?  Wow, I've wasted quite a bit of time here.
