           so this guy called here (at work) earlier.  he's a nys trooper candidate and he's having an issue.  (one of my doctors is the one that coordinates all of the psych evals for trooper candidates etc).  this guy could barely spit it out though.  his issue was that the place where he was trying to get records released from lost his release form.  he needed the fax number here.  he also needed another copy of the release form.  unfortunately, what he said (the first time he called) was "beh blah bep biddle boo" or some other nonsense.  he said things out of order and stuttered his way through his problem.  but he didn't tell me the whole thing.  just that the place lost his forms and that he needed our fax number.  not that he needed more forms.  and then when he ended the conversation he couldn't figure out what to say.  finally he just said "thank you."  then an hour later he called back with the same issue.  this time he was trying to say that he needed the forms.  so he's going to show up here in a few minutes.  this'll be interesting.  i'm going to need to have him fill out a few lines on a couple forms, and i'm sure this'll confuse him.  God, what if this guy becomes a trooper?  Could you imagine getting pulled over by an idiot like that?  he'd come up to your window and stumble around trying to ask for your license/registration...  people would just drive away on him.
