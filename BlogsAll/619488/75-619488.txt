           so yay!  I'm getting this site a little better...  I've added some tiny blogs at the top corners: *random thought* and *random link*...  let's see how long they last!  I bet i never update them...  maybe i will...  beh.  anyway.  so we're still green.  idunno.  maybe now that i've got the javascript working that i was freaking being dumb about so it took me all afternoon (dammit, i can be such a dumbass sometimes.  i hate it when i make it harder than it has to be...) i'll get to the colors...  the thing is, i'm so obsessed with green rightnow (it just looks so pretty to me) that i'm really diggin' the site.  and the text is so much more visable...  and changing the colors requires thought.  beh.  i don't want to think.  so i downloaded Hair of the Dog singing "sweet caroline" last night and it is just the most perfect song.  i could listen to it always.  and that means that i probably will for about a week and a half and then move onto something else.  anyway.  the song just really makes me want to be out.  dammit.  why am i not out right now?  why do i spend all of my time in front of my computer, fucking around with my webpage?  oh yeah, that's because i'm a dork.  well, at least i'm a cute dork ;)
