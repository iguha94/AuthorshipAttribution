           i just let my ddr leave the house :(  my little brother's friends showed up at the door just now asking to borrow it so that they could play it using the HUGE projector over at their school.  I let them borrow my shitty pads (my good ones were not going to leave the house) the playstation and 4th mix (i have two copies of it).  and now that it's gone, i want to play  so bad .  i told my brother that he must hook up the playstation immediately upon its return so that i may play.  i was completely in the mood to play today :(  i've been listening to a bunch of ddr songs that i had on a minidisc in my car (at one point i was stopped at a light and "oh nick please not so quick" from 3rd mix was playing and it was kinda embarrassing).  ddr songs completely make me happy... but i speed more when i listen to them (hey, they're dance music).  actually, who am i kidding?  i speed no matter what kind of music is on...  i have a speeding problem...  i like to go the same mph as the route number that i'm on ('cept for on rte 146 'cause that would just be rediculous)...  and i like to go 88 and yell "88 mph!" just like doc from back to the future...  i'm a dork.  the fastest i've ever gone is 105, but my spedometor goes up to 135, so my goal is to get there someday.  and not die.  or get pulled over.  that would be quite a ticket, i don't think i could cry my way out of that one.  the highest potential ticket that i've ever cried my way out of was for going 83 in a 55.  i was proud of that one...  morelater
