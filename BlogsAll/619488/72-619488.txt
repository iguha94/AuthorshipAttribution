           So I decided over the weekend that I'm not going to be a teacher anymore.  Well, at least not now.  I don't think that's what I really want to do.  I don't know what I want to do, really.  I guess right now I just want a job that allows me to pay my rent and go out on the weekends.  That's all I really want right now.  Someday I'm sure I'll want more, and that's when I'll think about going back to school or whatever.  But right now, since I'm not sure what I want to do I don't think it's a good idea to continue to go to school (and dig myself further in debt with student loans).  Soyeah.  Gotta finda job.  The tough thing is, I know that career is never really going to be a priority for me.  I just want to work because I need to make money to live on my own and do what I want to do.  So nailing down a specific job to go for is hard because, frankly, I really don't care all that much.  I'm going to a job fair later on today.  Hopefully, I'll get a better idea of what's out there...   I feel bad though.  I'm leaving these doctors that I work for after only a few months.  That's exactly what happened with their last secretary.  She was a civil engineer who was going for her MBA, but decided after a few months that school wasn't for her anymore and she was going to try and find a "real job" using her degree.  And now I'm doing the exact same thing to them.  I suck.
