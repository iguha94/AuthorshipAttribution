           went to the bookstore at school yesterday right after work to buy the book for last night's class so i could get my reading done.  i wasn't really paying attention while i was driving and after i got to the 2nd light i started to turn left.  immediately realized my mistake: generally i go to school from my house, so turning left at the 2nd light is correct.  unfortunately, turning left at the 2nd light from work is not correct.  in fact, it's very wrong, i was now headed the wrong way down a one way street.  i fortunately had realized my mistake quick enough and there were no cars parked on the right side of the street so i pulled over and, oddly enough, tried to hide.  after i calmed myself down a little bit i tried to figure out how i was going to get out of this situation.  there were, of course, cars streaming down the street at me providing no break in which i could quickly turn around and get back onto madison ave.  so i did what i generally always do lately in a time of crisis (see bug attack post of a few weeks ago), i called becky.  after she laughed at me (hell, i would of done the same) she pointed out that anybody around me didn't know me, so what did it matter?  this is true, except that i wish it had been a lot of people that knew me around.  then i could laugh with them at my stupidity.  but these people would be just laughing at me.  not so good.  after freaking out on the phone for a few minutes i finally saw a break in the traffic and pulled out and turned around.  tres embarrasing.  then i hung up the phone because i didn't want to be that girl that not only obviously can't drive as evidenced by her trip the wrong way down a one way road but who also talks on her cell phone while driving (which is, of course, illegal in the state of NY)
