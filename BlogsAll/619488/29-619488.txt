           so last night was fun..  beck and i went up to lake george and met her brother and a few other firemen from becky's fire company.  there was a firefighter convention up in lake george this weekend so the whole town was full of firefighters...  we stopped first at a tent where one company's party had been going on, but by the time we got there it was pretty much over.  we downed a couple of free drinks (who am i kidding...  i didn't pay for my drinks later either - i love being a girl)  before heading into town to go to one of the local bars.  the bar we ended up in was packed, but most of the people there seemed pretty old to beck and i (probably late 20s to mid 30s), but we had a good time.  we got miller light pins from some girl that looked like bottle caps that had flashing leds on it which we pinned to our shirts (which led to some guy later telling me that i had a nice flasher - eww)...  we didn't end up staying there too long which was fine with me 'cause it was really crowded and really smoky and i'd drunk my captain and cokes way too fast...  on the way out some 82 year old (ok, i'm exageratting but he looked old) guy that looked like pop-eye hit on me, which pretty much grossed me out..  we ended up walking around the village with beck's brother and the firemen until beck was sober enough to drive and then we headed home...  i had a good time...  i love lake george.  you can get drunk and wander around town from bar to bar and feel safe the whole time 'cause it's a little resort town.  and it's so nice by the lake.  i really enjoyed camping up there last year...  i hope i'll get to do it again...
