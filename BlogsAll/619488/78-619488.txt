           So has anyone ever heard the expression, "the whole thing from soup to nuts"?  I was sitting in class Wednesday night, bored out of my mind and staring off into space, when I heard my prof say, "It was the whole thing, from soup to nuts."  I immediately looked up with an odd look on my face.  First of all, I heard "soupy nuts" which is gross, and I almost started laughing right away when I realized that she said "soup to nuts."  Then the girl next to me said, "yeah, I've never heard that expression either, but I think it means when you have dinner you'd start with soup..." and I'm thinking, "and end with nuts?"  The whole thing was just too odd for me, and frankly I guess I'm not that mature, because I couldn't help but want to laugh.  So I had to sit there for ten minutes trying to supress a giggling fit.  I just kept thinking "nuts?"  You end dinner with nuts?  And, you know, in what sense of the word?  God, I'm so immature.  Whatever...  I just couldn't help it.  So later on, during a break, this guy that I'd never talked to before from my class who looks German to me because he looks Aryan (and kind of reminds me of Billy Idol) came up to me and said, "So, what got you laughing so much about 'soup to nuts'?"  I was hella embarrassed...  I'd never talked to this kid before and he comes up to me and asks me about nuts...  I said, "Well, you know...  I'd never heard that expression before, and I was thinking... Uh, you don't want to know what I was thinking..." and he laughed and said that sometimes he starts laughing to himself in class and can't stop either.  I told him that I was so glad that I'm not the only one that it happens to, and that it happens to me all the time and he laughed.  I was just so embarrassed though that someone caught me, and then asked me about it...
