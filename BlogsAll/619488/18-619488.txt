           so this is the last that I'm going to write about the tim matter...     *he's an asshole.    *he's a liar.  He's lied to me, he's lied to his friends, and he's lied (probably still is) to his new girlfriend.  *he fucking cheated on me.  and then when 'the other woman' insisted that he break it off with me, he did... calling it a break.  and he had no intention of ever telling me what was really going on.  and he lied to her telling her that he told me about her.  but he didn't.  he kept me hanging on.  kept calling me honey...  kept saying that he loved me while he was telling her he loved her too.  and even when i confronted him about it with evidence he lied to me.  and he did it again and agian.  asshole.   *he's apparently been telling people that i'm making things up.  sorry, but this is all stranger than fiction to me.  i couldn't just make this shit up.  He was my first love and he fucked me over.   *he's a cheating, lying asshole, and i am  so  done with him.  I'm so glad that i got to be the one to tell him that i never wanted to see him again and hang up on him  twice  (yeah, he came back for more)   so that's it.  if I write more about it please feel free to yell at me.
