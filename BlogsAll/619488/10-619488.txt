           so i'm doing a little better on the crying thing, but i think it's because i haven't really accepted it.  it is just too sudden and it just seems to irrational and weird.  and i still love him...  i just don't think that it  can  be real.  but it is very possible that it is and that Tim and I will never be together again.  i don't know how to make myself accept that possibility.  i don't  want  to accept it, but i know that I have to.  I'm deluding myself into thinking that everything is ok by involuntarily imagining it, by just thinking that i haven't seen or spoken to tim because he's been busy.  i guess it will really be real for me as time passes.  i don't want it to happen, but i have no control over the situation...  this sux (understatement).  Now i'm off to work the overnight shift at the hospital...  hopefully i'll be busy so that i won't be sitting there thinking about how i miss tim and how he'll be awake and at his hospital...  i love him so much, and i'm so proud of him...  i can't believe that i won't be there when he graduates.  he's going to be such a great nurse, and he's worked so hard for it.  i hope he knows it.
