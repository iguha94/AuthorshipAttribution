           I'm having a depressed day.  I just can't help thinking about all of the fun that Tim and I had together and I miss him so bad, and I'm so hurt that he doesn't want that anymore.  I know I just have to move on and it will all get better eventually, but I really don't  want  to move on in my life without him.  I know I can do it, and I know I have to do it, but it doesn't change the fact that I don't  want  to do it.  I know that it would be better for me if I could just cut him out of my life all together.  I've been thinking about him and caring about him, but I don't know that he's been doing the same for me.  He probably hasn't.  I'm not being fair to myself by continuing to give to a relationship that's not there anymore.  But it was just taken away so quickly that I don't know how to react.  I'm not mad at him.  He wasn't a jerk.  He can't help the way he feels.  But I can't help the way that I feel either.  I hurt and I can't help but still want him and still think about him.  I've been doing everything that I can to distract myself, but I can't stop thinking of him all the time.  He was just such a huge part of my life for so long.  People notice all the time that I'm not my usual chipper self, and I hate that.  He says this is 'for the best' and that he hopes that someday I'll see that.  Well, I don't.  I think he's made a huge mistake, and I hope someday he'll see that.  Well, that was a depressing post, but it's the only thing on my mind right now.  ali
