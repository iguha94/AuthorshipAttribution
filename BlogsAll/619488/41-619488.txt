           so the dave matthews band concert was great :)  becky and i got up to SPAC around 430 or 5 with our last minute tailgate dinner: gin and tonics and sushi...  we got good and drunk before we went into the concert (our drinks got stronger as we got drunker...  all of a sudden a gin and tonic consists of 3/4 gin and 1/4 tonic...).  we didn't listen to the opening band really - they sounded pretty bland from what i heard...  dave was great...  the minute the music started the air got cloudy and the music seemed better :)  when it started to get dark it rained off an on which was a godsend cause it was so freaking hot and humid!  there were some cool lightening flashes too...   The concert seemed short...  dave started around 830 or so, and we were leaving at 1030 (actually, i guess about 2 hours is a good amount of time to be performing...)...  it took  forever  to get out of the parking lot!  It was about 1/2 hour before we were even able to move the car, and then about another hour before we were out of SPAC and on our way home...  it sucked.  the freaks were out in full force...  on the way into spac there was this really annoying girl in a purple hippy dress who was hanging out her car window shouting to people....  then she saw a cop on a horse and got out, ran over to the horse and started petting it shouting, "oh my gawd!  isn't it a gawgeous horse!"  i was like, honey, if you're high already, you should get back in your car and not run up to cops...  anyway...  good times...  morelater...
