           so becky and i went to crossgates last night and saw signs.  i enjoyed it.  we were freaking out the whole time because we heard that it was a real scary movie, but it turns out that we didn't have to freak out that much.  we kept wispering "i'm gonna scream" to eachother and putting down the popcorn lest we throw it...  soyeah the movie is pretty good, it's not what you expected if you went to see a scary movie, but it's better than expected.  it's more about the people in the movie when it's all said and done...  i liked it.  i will most likely purchase it on dvd when it's available previously viewed at hollywood video.    soyeah, when we got back to my apartment we just bummed around and talked for a bit.  the conversation turned towards ex-boyfriends and i expressed dissappointment in the fact that i'd wasted a lot of time on tim.  if i'd have known that he was a cheater ahead of time, i wouldn't have gone out with him.  once they cheat, they'll do it again (sounds like we're talking about dogs or cattle).  becky said that cheaters should have to register, like sex-offenders have to.  then i said, yeah, we should make a website where women can go to it and search through a database to find out if the guy she's considering dating is a cheater or some sort of other huge asshole.  we laughed about it and realized that even though a site like that would be useful and probably sucessful, it would also probably open us up to lawsuits...  i threw together   this mock site  cause i thought it was funny :)
