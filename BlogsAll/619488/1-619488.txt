           Just got back from seeing Spider-Man..  Loved it! :)  It was just a great movie...  action-packed and full of humor...  Tobey Maguire was excellent as Peter Parker/Spider-Man - he did a great job showing the outsider/geek side of Parker, which made the transformation into Spider-Man very satisfying...  The only thing that really stuck out in my mind as amiss about the movie was Kirsten Dunst.  I've seen her in other movies and she looks cute, but in this one, she just looked awful compared to her other appearences.  I don't know what it was... probably the red hair.  She doesn't have the coloring for it, but it was necessary for the role...  also, it looked like they rushed through makeup...  in a couple of shots her lipstick looked like it wasn't even covering all of her lips which made her lips look really small.  I felt bad for her, she's a cute girl and she looked sick in this movie.  I'd be pissed if I was her...   Maguire on the other hand...  He looked awesome :)  I heard he did a lot of preparation for the movie, and it shows ;)  Very cute...    So, it's been a spider day unfortunately...  in the car on the way to the movie, a spider freaking crawled on me!  I was so grossed out...  first, it was on my jeans and I freaked out and brushed it off...  and then I didn't see where it went, and then it was on my arm...  I freaked out and brushed it off again (then my brother killed it...  or he said he did)...  Then, after the movie on the way home there was one crawling on the outside of my window (eww)...  and then when we got home there was one dangling in the hallway outside of my room (eww)...  David killed those last two also... but, eww.  I hate spider days...  weird that there were so many on the day that we saw Spider-Man though...  and eww eww eww, i still can't believe there was one crawling all over me...  eww..  now every time I feel a little itch or anything I'm sure that there's a spider on me...  eww.
