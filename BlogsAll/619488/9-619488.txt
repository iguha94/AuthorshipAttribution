           i'm a bitch today.  everything is irritating me.  went to the YMCA... everybody there seemed like an asshole... but that could just be the truth, this  is  clifton park...  i walked around the track for a long time and did the elliptical machine for a half an hour, and i haven't done anything for like three weeks cause of my ankle so now my legs feel hella tired.   i had the most hellish time at the dentist last evening.  I was really tired cause i'd been up all night at work the night before, and so i kept yawning...  then the dr kept drilling my gums  ouch  i was like, "see that pink part?  yeah, that's my gum, don't drill it"...  the appointment took forever, and then, to top it all off, they had B95.5 on the radio which plays soft rock (which irritates me to begin with) and there was some stupid radio show, 'Delilah', on and they played all sorts of love or post-love songs that really depressed the hell out of me.  They played that song from Pearl Harbor and if you don't think that it's about someone who's died, you can apply it to a dead relationship, and it's hella depressing...  and it made me think of the movie which made me think of going to see it with tim...  ugh, very depressing...  so i'm sitting there with my mouth crammed full of tubes and sucky-things and drills and fingers etc and i started tearing up.  sucked.  i miss tim.
