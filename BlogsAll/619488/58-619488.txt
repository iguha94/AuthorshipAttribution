           so beck got me thinking about tattoos...  she sounds like she's definately getting one, and she sent me a link to   tattoodles  where she found some pretty cool looking celtic designs (she liked the ones in celtic p13 and 15).  I looked at the ones she liked (pretty hella cool), and i started looking around trying to pick what i'd get if i was going to get a tattoo..  i always thought that one on the small of my back would be cool...  it's a good spot.  completely nonvisable in a professional setting, but when you want it to be seen, it's not hard to show it off.  and really, the concept of me having a tattoo would probably really shock people, and i love that.  i realize that the impression that i give off when i don't know people very well is that i'm shy and nice.  and that's true, to an extent :)  i am shy.  but lately, i've been getting over that.  and i'm nicer than most people, when i want to be...  coming off as sweet and innocent has always worked for me...  but i love surprising people when i bust out with something that they completely thought i'd never say/do/etc.  i've even been surprising myself lately...  like with actually wanting a tattoo...  i really like the tribal butterfly designs found on   tattoodles  tribal section pages 6, 21, and 24.  i can't decide which one i like the most though...  check 'em out and leave me feedback...   (song of the moment: cheap trick "i want you to want me")
