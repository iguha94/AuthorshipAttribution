           so random-guy-hit-on-me week continues...  I met Amy and Carrie for lunch at the Metro 50 diner outside of Crossgates (we'd never been there before, and Carrie wanted to try it out because it's shiny [it's covered in chrome]) and there was a fire truck outside with its ladder extended.  I guess one of the local fire companies was promoting halloween safety or something.  Anyway, so they had some guy walking around in a dalmation suit and he came inside the diner a couple times and was kind of barking which kind of made me want to be hysterical.  So when we left Carrie and Amy's car was right near the truck so we walked in that direction and I was standing there talking to Carrie and looking at the truck.  I got out my cell phone and returned a call to Beck to see what she was up to, and the firemen and the guy in the dog suit were kinda making fun of me because I was on the phone.  The dalmation pulled out a cellphone and pretended to talk on it, and then he came up to me and put his arm around me and continued to pretend to talk on his cellphone...  I wish someone had a camera, it was too funny. So anyways, before I left, I went over to the truck and asked if I could have a hat, and they gave one to me.  So now I'm a "Westmere fire district Junior Cheif" :)  I wanted to climb the ladder, but I didn't ask because I didn't think they'd let me...  That and if I did climb up to the top I'd probably freak out and have to have someone come and help me down...
