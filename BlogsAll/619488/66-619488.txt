           yet again i've spent my whole day wasting time and doing nothing productive.  i have an assignment due tonight, and i half-assedly did it and i suck.  what's really annoying, is i'll get full credit for the crap i'm handing in.  i'm so not motivated to go to school anymore.  i hate school.  school is boring.  what am i going to be when i grow up?  a teacher.  there's something fucked up right there.  it's so bad.  all i want to do is... nothing.  i don't know.  i just want to have fun.  or just do nothing really.  i'm really good at both of those things.  what i need now is to find a job where i could put my unique talents to work.  here's what i'm excellent at:  *wasting time *putzing around on the internet *daydreaming *shopping *finding excuses to waste time/shop/do nothing when i should be doing something *looking innocent *being bored *researching anything that interests me but nothing that's useful...   there's more, but i have to get dressed and go to class.  soyeah, if anyone has any ideas about how i can apply my talents in a field that's lucrative give me some comments down there...  yeah.  if not, i'm just going to have to win the lotto or find myself a sugar daddy because this working crap is just not working out for me...
