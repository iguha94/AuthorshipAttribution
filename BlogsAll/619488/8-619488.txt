           i dreamed about tim again last night...  the first one was this long wierd dream where he was still living at home, but his room was huge, kinda like an apartment, and there were all of these annoying girls redecorating it.  they weren't professionals or anything, they were just people that he or his friends knew.  and all of his friends that were at the wedding were there, but i couldn't find tim all of the time.  i'd see him and then he'd be gone...  it was like i wasn't really supposed to be there either for some reason.. like we had fought or like we were supposed to be broken up (like we are now) but i was there.  i think i had dropped something off and then i stayed or something like that.  anyway, these girls were destroying his room.  a couple of them were sawing the legs off of this table that looked like the kitchen table that tim and i bought together.  and when i found him and told him about it, he was really upset...   so this dream was really weird...  i'm trying to figure out what it means...  i guess it probably means something like i'm afraid that by shutting me out tim will let people in who aren't so good for him.  these girls were destroying his room, and his friends were all just sitting around watching, letting it happen.  i guess the table that looked like the one that we bought together was probably pretty symbolic.  maybe it was supposed to be our relationship or our potential future together...  i dunno...  maybe that's reading too far into just a weird dream....  whatever it meant, it was depressing.  i had another dream about tim last night, but i won't post a description of that because that one was a little...  um... personal...  i miss him :(
