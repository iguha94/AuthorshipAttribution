           so i'm sitting here in my office bored off of my ass and i'm listening to Hair of the Dog.  and of course, my one boss walks in when "I Used to Work in Chicago" was on.  And I didn't want to change it really quick, because that just about screams "i'm listening to slightly inappropriate music!" so I just left it on figuring maybe he wouldn't notice.  but of course he was in here for longer than he usually is, and he heard the last verse "a man and his wife/came in for a WWII german fighting airplane/what kind of plane said I?/Fauhker she said/And Fauhker I did!/And I can never go back anymore..."  I turned bright red, but he wasn't looking at me, so I thought, maybe he didn't notice, or maybe he just won't say anything, but of course luck was not with me.  as he was leaving my office he said, "that's some funky music you've got playing there" and i stammered something like, "yeah, um, it's, ah, Irish drinking music..."  That was just too embarrassing...  how do I always end up in situations like that?  at least i wasn't listening to puddle of mud (she hates me or smack my ass) which are also on this disc...  why couldn't he have walked in when some of Hair of the Dog's more traditional stuff was playing?  I suck.  I am just so professional...
