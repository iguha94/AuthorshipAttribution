           so i'm sitting here bored at work and i did another free tarot reading...  for my past card i got 'the high priestess' which apparently means that actions and conditioning from the past may be affecting the present situation and now may be the time to bring hidden knowledge to the surface.  whatever that means...  my present card was 'death'.  that doesn't seem like such a good thing...  but it symbolizes 'necessary, profound and wonderful change' that 'should not be resisted.'  'the death card instructs us to rid ourselves of old and useless attitudes, ideas, and situations.'  i'm supposed to 'look towards the future with faith not fear', and it says that in the midst of major changes, I feel stuck between the old and the new.  that's actually pretty right on for an internet tarot card reading :)  my future card was 'the lovers' which 'represents all that one would expect--love, friendship, marriage, sexuality, and the tree of life. The Lovers may also turn up at moral and ethical crossroads, representing major decisions, ordeals, duality, short trips and the road less taken. Their nakedness shows their freedom from ego and facade. Often times this card acts as a reminder to be true to oneself. New opportunities and relationships are steps away. Be true to your self throughout and all will work out fine.'  i dunno... that first part sounds promising :)
