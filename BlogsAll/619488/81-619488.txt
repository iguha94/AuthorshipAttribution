           so yesterday i decided that i was going to bring my cat (Dude) up to the apartment.  (my mom was absolutely thrilled).  so i drug my brother to wal-mart and bought all of the cat necessities (i couldn't take anything from home because my other cat (Tuxedo) is still living there.  i got one of those fancy litter boxes with a hood so i don't have to look at his crap, a cheapass bowl (from the dog section because my cat's such a pig that none of the bowls in the cat section would've been big enough), and of course litter and food.  the thing is, everything i wanted was on the top shelf, pushed towards the back.  so my brother and i had to scale the shelves of wal-mart in order to get the cat crap.  (i told my brother that we were going to wal-mart to buy catshit, and i think he really thought that's what i wanted to buy.  when we got there, i wondered aloud where they kept all of the catshit and some old woman passing by gave me a weird look).   so then last night after we were drinking at fridays (well, i was the DD so i only had one megamargarita while beck had three...) we decided to abduct my cat and bring him to my apartment.  so we snuck into my house at 1am, grabbed Dude and took off.  Beck held Dude in the car for me, and he was shaking pretty much the entire way here.  he seems to like the apartment.  he's already found a couple places to hide where i have no idea where he is.  when we went to bedlast night, he wouldn't get off of me, but now he seems fine.  he's such a lazy, boring cat though.  all he does is sleep on my bed.  it's a comfortable bed though, that's pretty much all i want to do also...
