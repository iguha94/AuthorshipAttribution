           so i was supposed to go out last night w/becky but on her way here she got a call (she's a volunteer fireman...  or i guess it would be fireperson or firewoman, but becky's not that picky and we kinda think it's gay when someone gets all particular aout crap like that).  anyway, so she was stuck helping the rest of her fire company try and move a 500 lb man (how do you get to that point?  really.  i mean, really.  eww.) until late and we didn't end up going out, but that's ok because i entertained myself with crap tv and saved a couple bucks by not going out...  i watched the NFL kickoff concert on CBS.  i can't believe they actually had football players walking a catwalk in a sort of fashion show.  it was so entirely gay.  i mean, really.  i don't want to watch football players strutting down a catwalk, i want to see them slamming into eachother on a field...  i think the only way they got everyone to agree was to have the football players escorted down the catwalk by models wearing only football jerseys.  bon jovi was great.  he's still hot.  and they sound great live, unlike some other bands that sound like crap and it's hella dissapointing.  they did some queer thing where they tried to make a connection between 9/11 and the NFL, which i felt was stretched, and it seemed like they were trying to rationalize their being in NYC having a party.  after that was over i watched "married, with children" which i haven't seen in forever because i generally hate that show.  after watching an entire episode last night i realized that my thoughts on that show were completely right and i hope to never watch it again.  then i watched "king of the hill" which was great.  the beavis-like character who's always smoking and talking in monotone cracks me up.  anyway...  adventures in bad television...
