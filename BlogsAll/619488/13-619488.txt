           so...  what else happened today...  oh, i got new underwear!  that was exciting :) i got a free pair of nude colored underwear from Victoria's Secret (coupon) and $5 off my purchase, so i got another cute pair of underwear - multicolored thin stripes - and a cute yellow bra.  they made me happy  :)  i played ddr (5th mix) at the mall, that was fun...  i put together cover letters and resumes for a bunch of different jobs.  i've decided that i'm going to apply for a part time job that has set hours (and preferably pays well also) that will work when i go back to school.  and so i'll work that job and the hospital job over the summer and when i go back to school in the fall i'll cut back to just the part time job.  so i'm excited :) i've put together two of my professional little cover letter/resume packets to go out in the mail tomorrow, and two more packets to be faxed tomorrow, and then i have a bunch of other ads marked in the paper for places that i'm going to call.  this should be exciting.  i hate interviewing, but i need a new job.  it's time to stop bitching about the crappy job that i have now and start looking for a new one.  also, getting a job that will work while i go back to school will help me with my anxiety about the fall.   so... what else...  i've started reading a new book,  The Nanny Diaries  which is pretty good so far...  and... ugh... i still haven't touched my laundry or started cleaning my room...  it's late now, so i promise myself (and you're witnessing) that i'll start all that cleaning crap tomorrow...  i give anyone who reads this permission to email/im me to bug me if they see on the webcam that i haven't started yet...
