           so i watched a really good football game today between the university of michigan and the university of washington.  i rooted (is that how you spell that?) for michigan because my mom lives in michigan and i've been to ann arbor...  and the "wolverines" sound much cooler than the "huskies"...  i mean, wolverine is an x-man...  that's pretty much my whole theory of picking a team to cheer for when i don't know either team playing in a game, i pick the one from the state/city that i've visited or the one with the cooler mascot/colors...  that's pretty much a decidedly girl way to pick, but hey, i enjoy football, but when i don't know either team i've got to pick a team somehow because it's no fun to watch a game where you don't care who wins...  soyeah...  it was a great game, really close at the end (29-28 Washington) but Michigan won in the last 6 seconds with a 44 yard field goal (which was amazing 'cause their kickers had sucked it up the whole game)...   I forgot how much i enjoy football, and now i'm  so  looking forward to fall...  i think i want to go to penn state to see a game this fall cause it's something i've  always  wanted to do...  my mom and dad both went to penn state and i always thought when i was growing up that that's where i would go too, but then when it came time i didn't end up applying there...  soyeah, when i was little my mom lived in Furnace, PA which is just outside of State College, PA where the main campus of psu is located (she was attending classes there at the time), and i completely enjoyed being there when i was little...  we went to the creamery and ate peanut butter ice cream (hella good)...  yeahso...  rambling...  morelater...
