           Sunday was a pretty good day actually...   i went to church in the morning and the priest was the long-winded one but he told a humorous story about being preached to by a 10-year-old Jehovah's witness on his front stoop....  then i went shopping at wal-mart with my dad...  i love my daddy :)   then i talked to tim, who wanted me to come over and fix his palm (it won't sync right with his computer) but he decided that he was too tired today, so i'm going over tomorrow.  I know, i shouldn't...  but i figure i'm going to do this favor for him, and then tell him that i don't think i can be his friend right now while my feelings for him are still wanting to be a girlfriend and so i'm not going to be able to see him for a while.  not till i can get over these feelings that i have for him.  I hope I'll be able to be his friend someday, but right now it can't happen because everytime i see him or hear from him i get my hopes up, so in order for me to heal not seeing him is probably best. :(   then becky came over and we went out for cofee and then came back here to watch the 3rd season of Sex and the City on DVD.  We watched it for 6 hours :) I love that show...  i figure that if i identify with anyone on that show, it's probably a mix between Carrie and Charlotte...  I tend to be sometimes innocent like Charlotte, but I also tend to obsess over relationships like Carrie (that should be obvious from the content of this website)...  watching that show makes me feel more confident, sexy and powerful...  like somehow the attitudes of the characters rub off on me or something...  anyway, so we watched Sex and the City and then went to Denny's for like the third night in a row and got late night food...  so that explains why it's 3am and I'm up posting to my blog...
