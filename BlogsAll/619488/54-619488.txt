           I decided to walk down to school today to pick up my loan refund check.  The walk was very nice, except for the one part where I have to walk past this huge, creepy, old apartment building.  When I got back, this long-haired cat with a fucked up ear was sitting outside of my building.  I saw him on the way out and gave him some love, so when I saw him in front of my building upon my return I gave him more love.  But then when I went to open the door he made it clear that he was coming inside.  I didn't know what to do, so I figured that I'd go in the vestibule, and if he followed me I'd try and make him go back out.  Well, that was impossible, he walked right up to the second door and started pawing at it like, "let me in."  So now i'm like, great, what do I do?  I mean, he most likely belongs to someone in the building because what cat would just walk in like that if he didn't live there.  And he looks like he has an owner because his fur is all nice and he has stiches in the one ear.  So I just pretended not to see him walk in.  Then he kinda started walking down the hall so I quick got into my apartment before he could follow.  I think (hope) he went to find his owner's apartment.  I hope he actually lives in here, I don't want to be "that girl that lets strange animals in the building."
