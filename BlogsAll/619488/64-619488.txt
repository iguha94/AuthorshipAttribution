           so last week i had this incredibly detailed dream and one of the major things that happened was there was a fire in my house, especially in my bedroom.  (  see the post from Thursday, 9/26 ) so i got bored (what else is new, really?) and decided to try and find a place online that would interpret my dream.  i found   dreammoods.com .  here was their interpretation of fire in a dream: "Depending on the context of your dream, to see fire in your dream can symbolizes destruction, passion, desire, illumination, transformation, enlightenment, or anger. It may suggest that something old is passing and something new is entering your life. Your thoughts and views are changing. In particular, if the fire is under control or contained in one area, it is a metaphor of your own internal fire and inner transformation. It also represents your drive and motivation.  To dream that a house is on fire, signifies passion and loving companions."  so i figure that the fire in the bedroom symbolizes my realization that i'm completely over Tim and my readiness for something new (although not a new relationship...  just something new.  just being single and having fun for a while...).  so what seemed like something really stressfull in the dream was actually a symbol of something great!  So then I saw that (hot) fireman in my dream and at   dreammoods  they say that "To see a fire fighter in your dream, signifies long lasting friendships" and I saw that fireman in my dream right before I tried to call Becky.  i'm fascinated with how right on that dream interpretation was...  i hope i remember what i dream of tonight so i can interpret it...   this is my new obsession! :)
