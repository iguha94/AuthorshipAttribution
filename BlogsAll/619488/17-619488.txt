           ok. so...  i was reading the comments posted on my page a little earlier, and i really appreciate the supportive things said :)  i visited   the one guy's page , and he posted a little comment on it along with a link to my blog...  he said:  "This is my last post until Monday. I was cruising around other people's blogs and ran into this story about a girl who's boyfriend dumps her and then asks her to fix his computer. Imagine the audacity! and she goes over and fixes the computer! Holy crap?!?! "  and damn, when you put it like that, what  was  i thinking?  nothing like listening to a total stranger's point of view to really give you a kick in the pants...  (for the record...  i didn't know that he was a lying, cheating asshole at the time and i thought i could be his friend.  but then i realized that by trying to be his friend it kept me hanging on.  so i went over there thinking that i'll do him this favor [but  why  really?] and tell him that i couldn't deal with being his friend anymore... and if i hadn't gone and found that card that 'the other woman' gave him, i probably would have never found out that he's a lying, cheating asshole) and now that i think of it, how could i ever have really lasted with a guy who's so technologically clueless?
