           so here's what the e3 awards had to say about the sims online:  Is Will Wright a genius? Or is he just the one-man advance team for an alien race, sapping our energies with games that gleefully absorb more and more of our time, until we're helpless to resist their ruthless march toward galactic rule? There's evidence for both in The Sims Online, which takes the sitcom ingenuity of The Sims and turns it into a reality TV soap opera. The fact that it deviates from the sword-and-sorcery games that currently dominate the MMORPG space - not to mention the plethora of sci-fi-inspired persistent state world games coming down the pipe-makes it remarkable. But the fact that it gives you multiple ways to play the game, and cleverly encourages you to play well with others, and explicitly rewards you for it -well, that makes it unprecedented. When The Sims Online launches this fall, it won't be competing with Everquest or Asheron's Call; its competition will be Friends and Everybody Loves Raymond - that's how effectively and uniquely it demands your time and attention. And there are so many brilliant concepts wrapped up in this game that the industry will be studying it - and copying it - for years to come. Resistance is futile.  I've gotta say, i'm a little afraid of this next sims incarnation.  i mean, i can't wait to try it, but i'm afraid i'll be trapped, stuck in simworld forever...  this is not good.
