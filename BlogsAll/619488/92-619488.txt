           I'm so bored.  I want to die.  I got here this morning and I thought maybe it'd be a busy day.  The people who were scheduled for testing were already waiting downstairs, so I knew I'd have to get their test forms setup right away and get them started.  And there seemed to be a ton of stuff in my "to do by the end of the day" box from Jeff.  But after I got the people started on their test and got into my box, I realized that there wasn't much there.  All of the work that was left for me took a grand total of 20 minutes.  Now I'm left to sit here alone for the rest of the day.  Both Jeff and Bill are out of the office.  This is a good thing usually.  I can usually run around and play my music and goof off and dance (I know, I'm weird) but since there are people in the waiting room taking tests all I can do is sit here in my tiny closetoffice and putz around on the computer.  Hopefully they'll leave soon.  soyeah.  bored.  slightly sleepy.  starving.  am going to make great cookies after work today to take along to beck's house.  she's making dinner again: homemade mac & cheese.  mmm...  i wish i had homemade mac&cheese right now.  this room is so cold. there's no heater in here.  suck.  what an awful, boring, rambling post.  better just stop now.
