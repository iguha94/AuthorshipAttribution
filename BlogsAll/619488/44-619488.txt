           so i've heard the song "Don't Fear the Reaper" by   The Blue Oyster Cult  4 times in the past 2 days.  Weird.  Seriously, every time I've started up my car the last 4 times I've started it it's been playing.  WEIRD.  Here are the lyrics...  if you've never heard it, it's kinda creepy sounding...  I hope this doesn't mean anything...  it's probably some sign and I'll be dead soon.  dammit.    All our times have come Here but now they’re gone  Seasons don’t fear the reaper Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain We can be like they are Come on, baby Don’t fear the reaper Baby, take my hand Don’t fear the reaper We’ll be able to fly Don’t fear the reaper Baby, I’m your man  La, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la  Valentine is done Here but now they’re gone  Romeo and Juliet Are together in eternity Romeo and Juliet Forty thousand men and women everyday Like Romeo and Juliet Forty thousand men and women everyday Redefine happiness Another forty thousand comin’ everyday We can be like they are Come on, baby Don’t fear the reaper Baby, take my hand Don’t fear the reaper We’ll be able to fly Don’t fear the reaper Baby I’m your man  La, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la  Love of two is one Here but now they’re gone  Came the last night of sadness And it was clear that she couldn’t go on And the door was open and the wind appeared The candles blew and then disappeared The curtains flew and then he appeared  Saying don’t be afraid Come on, baby And she had no fear And she ran to him Then they started to fly They looked backward and said goodbye She had become like they are She had taken his hand She had become like they are Come on, baby Don’t fear the reaper
