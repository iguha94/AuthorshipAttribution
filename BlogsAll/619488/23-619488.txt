           i don't know what's wrong with me tonight...  i can't get to sleep...  i've been so awake putzin around on my computer for hours, and when i finally got in bed i couldn't sleep.  i just cried.  i haven't cried in almost a week, i thought i was done with that.  i don't even really know what i'm crying over.  i mean, i  know  he's an asshole, i  know  he treated me badly, i  know  i deserve more than that and i  know  that i shouldn't waste my time thinking about him anymore.  but he just pops in there every once in a while.  i dunno...  maybe it's habit cause we were together for so long.  but whatever it is, i wish it would stop.  i'm just so desperately sad tonight.  i don't miss how he treated me towards the end, but i guess i just miss the way it used to be.  and i miss knowing (or thinking that i knew) what was going to happen in the future...  i guess i'm a little scared.  i dunno.  everything's going well at my job, i'll be starting back at school in the fall..  but nothing feels right yet.  i just want to feel right again.  i feel bad that i broke my promise to myself that i wouldn't write about it anymore...  but i just can't help it tonight.  i'm just so sad and i'm tired of pretending to be happy and alright all the time.
