           I went for a 2 hour walk today in the   Vischer Ferry preserve .  It was really nice.  the sky was actually blue while i was out, the temperature was warm, and the smells and sounds of spring were in abundance....  i've never seen so many birds, they were all over the place.  i saw one pair of birds with bright orange-yellow chests chasing eachother, they looked like something right out of a disney movie.  I also saw this other HUGE bird, that i think was a crane.  At first when i saw it, i thought it was a swan because it looked very white when it flew across the canal, but when i got closer, i saw that it was gray.  it had a long neck, and when it flew, it drew its head close to its body.  it was really a big bird, the biggest i've ever seen close up in the wild.  i think its wingspan must have been like 3 or 4 feet.  it was really impressive and beautiful...  i was in a great mood while i was walking... i was thinking that no matter what the outcome of this break with tim, i'll be fine...  but when i got home, my mood came crashing down.  i may be fine eventually, but right now i miss him a lot.  and i still love him, and i wish he'd call.  he said he would, but what's he waiting for?  i mean even if we're just friends permanently, friends call eachother...  maybe he's waiting so that i have a chance to soak it in or whatever...  i don't know.  all i know is that this hurts, and i feel like i don't matter that much to him, or that this isn't hard for him, cause he doesn't call. :(
