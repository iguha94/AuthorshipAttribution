           so i didn't have to go down to the basement today (yay)!  the plumbers didn't show up until just when i was leaving, so i booked out of there so i wouldn't have to go down there.  it's just so freaky...  I called Mary Ellen at Mercury to give her a start date.  I said Mon, Dec. 9, which is about a week after she was expecting me to start, and she said she'd have to check with Andy (the manager) and get back to me.  i hope that's going to be ok.  now i feel like a tool.  i suck.    so the cable guy still isn't here.  the slot of time is between noon and 4:30, so there's still 2 hours left in the slot, but i didn't get here till 1 because of work, and i'm all paranoid that i missed him.  the woman on the phone yesterday said that if i missed him then to call right away so they could see about getting someone else out here, but how would i know if i missed him?  i mean, since she said that i guess they'd leave something in my mailbox or something like that...  there wasn't anything there when i got home (i don't think...  now i'm going to obsessively check it...  irritating) so i don't think i missed him.  it would suck if i didn't end up getting cable today, 'cause i was all psyched about new south park...  i guess i better finish up my homework for tonight, because after i get cable there will be no homework doing...
