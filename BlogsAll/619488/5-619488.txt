           my schedule for the fall looks pretty good...  I've signed up for 12 credits, and my classes are on Mon, Tues, and Wed evenings...  I can't wait to go back to school, all this free time is killing me...   I applied for the departmental secretary job at the hospital.  Hopefully, i'll get it...  they must not have had anybody apply for the job when they posted it in house a month ago cause it found its way into the paper, so i'll have an edge over outside applicants because I already work at the hospital...  it's full time first shift no weekends or holidays, and that would work out GREAT for my going to school...  when i student teach... well, that's a different story... but i won't mention the grad school thing in the interview...  i'll just screw 'em later....   *yawn* I'm "not needed" again tomorrow at the other job.  I wish they'd just tell me if they don't want me back ever, cause that's ok with me.  Why waste my time? unfortunately, i can't pick up any time at the hospital tomorrow, so it's just a lost day.  dammit.  the thing that sux the most about not working at the scoring place is missing the people who i worked with :(  we had fun...   i suck. maybe i sucked for a reason though, and i'll find a better job.  hopefully...  ah well...  enough worrying for tonight...
