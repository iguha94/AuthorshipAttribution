           so i found a webpage that tells you all sorts of stuff about your birthday...  did you know that today is  · Seventeenth of July Revolution Day (Iraq)    · Muñoz Rivera Day (Puerto Rico)    · Constitution Day (South Korea)    · National Tennis Month (U.S.) ? also, on this day in 1955 Disneyland, the first theme park ever, opened in Anaheim, CA...    but that's like the only happy thing ever that happened on my birthday..  never fly on my birthday, cause it's always unlucky...  JFK Jr. disappeared in his plane on my birthday, there was a huge horrible commercial plane crash one year that killed lots of people (i think that was the one leaving JFK or Laguardia  anyway, the site also had a little blurb about my astrological sign, Cancer, which said:  Cancerians are nurturing, emotional, sensitive, conservative, and home-loving, much more aware of how they feel than what they think. They are artistic, have vivid imaginations, and have highly developed memories.    that's pretty much true, i guess.  but with my memory, the highly developed part is that it stores everything good, and weeds out and deletes (or represses - whatever) most bad memories.  which is why i don't stay mad at people for long, i can't really remember why i was mad in the first place...   anyway...  i share my birthday with John Jacob Astor and Phyllis Diller (that weird, old comedienne).  so rich people and funny people are born on my birthday.  that's cool, cause i'd like to be both...
