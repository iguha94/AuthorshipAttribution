           so the general consensus seems to have been for me to call him (my mom even emailed me and said that my dad said i should call him...  i guess they do read my page).  soyeah.  i did call him today.  he seemed pretty receptive to talking to me.  I think he wanted to do something tonight, but Dodi's boyfriend broke up with her and I wanted to take her out so that she wouldn't be sitting home and sad.  I said that we might go up to Saratoga and he said that if we went up there I should call him and he'd come meet us out.  Then he asked what I was doing this weekend and I said that I'd probably be going up to the parting glass friday night because hair of the dog is playing.  so he said he'd look for me.  yeah.  we talked for a little while (but it was a little hard to understand him because he'd just woken up from a nap and he was mumbling with the accent and all).  then beck arrived so i said i had to run.  so beck and i took dodi out.  we ended up just pretty much going to friday's.  then we drove around looking for somewhere else to go, but it was monday night and pretty much everything was dead.  soyeah.  this week will be cool.  tomorrow: well, pretty much nothing.  decent tv though (that 70s show).  wednesday: guns 'n roses concert (awesome) thursday: thanksgiving (yumm).  friday: parting glass, hair of the dog (awesome).  saturday: ghettocharliebrownthanksgiving party at my house (menu: toast, popcorn, ramen, other ghettopoorkidfoods).  Soyeah.  cool.
