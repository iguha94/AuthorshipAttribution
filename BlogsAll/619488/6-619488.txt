             sleep was good :)  Now I'm getting ready to go to St.Rose and work on my schedule for the fall...  I guess I have to look for a new job too...  well, I'm not sure about that, I mean, my job hasn't told me not to come back (of course, i didn't call them yet today...), but I'm not sure that I want to go back anymore, cause I keep failing the tests, so what's the point?  I mean, I guess it might happen that I might pass one, but I'm like 0 for 5 or something like that so...  I'm thinking it's better for me not to waste my time going anymore and causing me all that stress and embarrassment (cause, i can't help it, i stress over it and get really embarrassed when i don't pass, and it only gets worse each time...  )...  so, perhaps I'll apply for the departmental secretary job at the hospital or go for the teaching ms office (I could do that, and it'd probably be fun for me)...  i dunno...  i guess it kinda depends on how my school schedule is gonna be, so i should stop worrying about it till after my meeting...  ugh...  i'm still so tired....      Tim takes his final today, and then he's done with nursing school :) He graduates May 19th.  I'm so happy for him...  He starts his new job at his hospital on June 10th.  We haven't been able to see much of eachother lately, but after he starts his new job maybe that will change.  It will be nice for him not to have to do both work and school for a while.  He's been so stressed out lately, I can't wait for him to be able to relax (and I'm sure he can't either)..  I'm so proud of him :)    I hope this meeting doesn't take too long...  i'm still hella tired, and i'm really not in the mood for this....  at least it's tuesday night and i get to see "That 70's Show" and "Smallville" when I get home...  :)    ...morelater...  ali
