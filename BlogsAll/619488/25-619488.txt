           so this weekend i'm stuck at home all weekend because my parents are both out of town.  my dad just left for saudi arabia today and my mom went to hilton head, sc, to pick up her grandson and bring him up here for a visit.  so what sucks is i'm expected to be here all weekend to look after my brothers.  so this is why it bothers me that they make me pay rent.  they make me pay rent, and at the same time they treat me like i was still a kid living off them.  they just expect me to always be here to watch kids/do favors whatever for them.  but if i was just a tenant paying rent they wouldn't expect me to watch kids.  the deal was i had to pay them 200/month to live here, not i had to pay them 200/month and perform any babysitting or assorted chores to live here.  not that i really mind, but i was planning on picking up two shifts at the hospital this weekend so that i'd have rent money for next month.  so i think that they should pay me the 160 that i'm missing out on by having to stick around the house all weekend.  i mean, really, where else are you going to get a babysitter that'd watch your kids for four days (fri, sat, sun, mon) for 160?  i just hope they see it my way when i hand them 40 for rent next month...  morelater
