           So I've been trying to find out what my name means and I'm getting all sorts of different answers.  My mom brought back this bookmark from Hong Kong for me and it says that my name consists of 3 traditional chinese calligraphy characters which mean "someone special, beauty, and trustworthy."  I got three good ones :)  So I wondered what my name means, where it came from etc. and I found a bunch of different answers.  First I went to   the parenthood.com website  where they have a big database of names and meanings etc and I typed in 'Alison' and it told me that my name is German and it means, "noble and kind."  That's ok, but it didn't satisfy me.  So then I had to try another site.  I went to   makewayforbaby.com  where they also have a big database, and when I typed in 'Alison' it gave me a bunch of different answers.  First it said it was Scottish, a form of Louise, which means "battle, famous."  Then it said it was German, meaning "sweet."  As an Irish name my name apparently means "honest."  And as an English name it's actually a guy's name that means "son of all."  According to   babynamenetwork.com  Alison means "the light of the sun" in Old English and it can be a boy or girl's name.  My nickname, Ali, means "exhalted or noble" and could also be for a boy or a girl.  It's really weird how you can get a ton of different meanings for one name...  i remember when i was younger i found my name in a book and i told my dad how it said that my name meant, "little truthful one" and he said that's because i tell little truth.   I also looked up Rebecca to see what Becky's name meant and it said "Captivating, Knotted Cord" which I thought was cool 'cause the tattoo that she got was a Celtic Knot...
