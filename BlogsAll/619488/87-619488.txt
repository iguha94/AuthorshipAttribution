           So here's my weekly horoscope:  CANCER Your creativity is heightened at the beginning of the week. In fact, if you are in the arts, Monday and most of Tuesday are as inspirational as they come. Look to get some long-avoided work done the rest of the week.  Your luck this week*  Love: C Money: C Work: A  ok, well, i like that "Work: A," because I'm going in for my second interview today with   mercury insurance  and it'd be sweet if they offered me the job.  i'd get cable right away then (hopefully by wednesday night because the new South Parks start then...).  My parents seem to think that they're going to offer me the job because they say that they don't bring you in for a second interview unless they intend on giving you the job.  well, that'd be nice, but all of the career-advice-sites that I've gone to don't really say that.  I'm nervous because I'm thinking that they can't decide between me and some other candidate, and I really want to make a good impression today.  But, I feel like we covered pretty much everything in the first interview, so i have no idea what we'll discuss today.  and i asked all of my questions the first time, i really don't know what to ask today, and every career-advice-site that i've gone to says that you should definately make a good impression by having questions prepared.  beh.  well, at least both of my doctors are out of the office today, so i can research some questions to ask, and also what to wear.  i've already worn my interview outfit, now i've got nothing to wear today.  it's a "work casual" environment, but i feel like if i just go in pants and a work-shirt i'll look too casual for an interview (even though it would be totally appropriate to wear to work there).  suck.  i hate this process, they better give me this job, 'cause i'm too lazy to do this again.
