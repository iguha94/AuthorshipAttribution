           so i just got back from an interview with   Mercury Insurance .  the interview was for a 'casualty adjuster' position, which i guess is sort of like an investigator...  people would come to me with claims and i'd investigate them and decide how much they'd get from the company.  so basically i'd be a god.  well, not really, but go with me on this, i'm trying to make this job sound really cool in my head...  i'd be a detective-god-like person.  (i didn't mention to the people interviewing me that that's what i thought of the position..  it would probably have sounded crazy).  so it was a great interview.  i was completely relaxed, and even though there were two people there asking me questions i didn't feel overwhelmed.  i don't know if i got the job, but if i did, i'd definately like the people who i'd be working with.  it sounds so weird, but i actually kinda had fun at the interview...   beh.  anyway, if i get the job, rock, if not, oh well.  i just have to find something by january...    so i'm going in to work at the hospital this thursday evening.  yay!  not.  i'm only going into work because then i'd have 'extra' money to go see guns n' roses in november.  that'll completely kick ass.   i hope we go.  becky keeps telling me that we're not partying again till st.patrick's day (she's the unhappy no-party dwarf) but then she mentioned going to see this concert so i'll have to pretend that it won't be partying...   but it totally would be :) shhh...
