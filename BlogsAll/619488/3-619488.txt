           Today sucked...  well, actually it wasn't that bad... I just wanted to go back to bed this morning, but I had to go to work...  then i left the house late and i got to work right at 8:00 when our manager-guy was giving a lecture on being prompt and working hard...  work went fast, which is a plus, but all day i was in a badish mood cause i had to go to the dentist right after work.  My appointment was for 4:30, and work only lets out at 4:00, so i had to speed all the way home and i made it to the dentist's office right before 4:30...  and then i had to wait for a half an hour.  That just sux.  And then, to top it all off, after i get in there he's trying to get a crown on, and it turns out that since he didn't put a temp crown on at my last appointment (when he kept grinding my GUM!) my teeth have moved and this crown was now useless.  So now i have to go back again for him to grind my teeth (GUM!) again and measure for another crown etc etc...  SUX!  But, after i got home i had chinese food (fortune: "your love of music will be an important part of your life") and Tim called and i felt all better...
