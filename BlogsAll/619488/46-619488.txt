           YAY!  I have road runner :)  but i'm still not hosting my page from my apartment, cause i don't want to leave my computer on all the time and suck my electricity....   so where it will end up remains to be seen.  butyeah, i'm hella excited that i have internet access from my place :)   school starts next week, and i can't wait.  I feel like such a freak, but i'm so bored not going to school.  i have an orientation night this wednesday.  i'm not sure exactly what they'll be doing.  'hi, welcome to gradschool.  buy your books and get your parking permits' but i don't plan on buying my books there, and i've been informed that you don't really need to get a parking permit at st rose so...  ah well..   i should have gotten cable at the same time.  if i had, i would have been able to watch trading spaces today.  but i thought that i'd go without cause i don't  need  cable.  i have a feeling that i'll be calling timewarner back by the end of the week and that same cable guy will be here next monday to install cable for me and i'll feel like a freak.  ah well.  i wish i could just subscribe to one channel, for like $5 a month or something.  all i really want is tlc.  then i'd have trading spaces and all their other nifty daytime shows (a makeover story, a wedding story, a baby story etc) and then all of their medical detectives-type shows at night...
