           okso, the "Work: A" part was true from my weekly horoscope...  i got the job at mercury insurance.  i was a little late to the interview (which annoyed the hell out of me.  but i just couldn't get out of the house) and i met with the regional director (ken?) right away.  he seemed nice..  kept going off on tangents about his kids and the local schools and the weather...  but nice all the same.  he asked me a few questions, but nothing really in depth, and then i asked him some things (what's the most important quality in order to succeed in this position?  how am i evaluated?  what are the opportunities for advancement?) and then he went and got Mary Ellen (who will be my supervisor).  I could tell from the way he was talking to me that I pretty much had the job.  then Andy (the branch manager) came out and we talked for a few minutes (he was on his way out to pick up a police report) and I got the impression that I was going to be working there from the casual manner in which we were talking, and then Mary Ellen came out and offered me the job...  it pays decently (actually, it pays just what i was realisitically looking for) and i get full   benefits (including discounted car insurance) .  I'm pretty excited.  and to celebrate, i'm calling up timewarner and getting cable (all i have now is roadrunner).  hopefully, they'll be able to get here by wednesday at ten, so i won't miss the new episodes of south park...  :)
