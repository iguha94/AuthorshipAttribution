           so, i can't believe   this show.   It's called the   Sunday Night Sex Show .  It's hosted by some Canadian grandma named Sue Johanson who answers questions from callers about anything related to sex.  And it's just so odd to watch.  People call in asking about...  everything, and little grandma there just talks away.  She's got a red and a blue model (like the ones artists use to draw people) behind her that she uses to demonstrate different positions, and she's got a "pleasure chest" that she pulls out and reviews different sex toys.  And when she's explaining things to people, she likes to use a lot of hand motions.  It's just so disturbing.  She often tells people to go down to their local sex shop to purchase different items.  Like for the one caller that Sue told the woman to go down to her local sex shop and buy a small butt plug called the "wild thing."  Disturbing.  She knew a specific name for one.  Canadians are kind of weird.  They talk about sex etc and then end the call with, "Ok, thanks, good enough!" like they were just buying tires or something.  One guy called in, and he was just a complete asshole.  He said that he and his girlfriend had anal sex two days ago and that since then she'd been bleeding.  He didn't seem to be concerened that she'd been bleeding for two days, he just wanted to know when they were going to be able to do it again.  Sue told him that he needed to take his girlfriend to the "emerge" (which is apparently what they call the ER in Canada).  What an ass though.  I think Sue should have told him to put his girlfriend on the phone so that she could tell her to dump his ass and go to the emerge herself.  Anyway.  I just couldn't believe this show existed.  Beck told me about it before, but I wasn't quite prepared to watch this sweet little old lady demonstrate how to use sex toys, etc.  The show is like a car wreck: horrifyingly fascinating.
