           oh. my. god.  packing sucks ass.  i am never going to finish this.  oh dear lord...  i've packed 9 boxes today and i still have a  ton  of stuff in my room...  suck suck suckedy suck.  i've been keeping organized while i do it though...  i'm labeling all of the boxes with a box #, the contents, and where it should go when it gets to the apartment...  i'm also keeping a spreadsheet of everything.  lets see if i can keep this up through the rest of my packing though..  i can't wait to just get into my apartment again and look around :)  when i get the keys i'm gonna go measure everything and then make a little floorplan so i can play at arranging my furniture before i bring the stuff in...  (i am just so hella excited...)...  i'm all depressed right now because my room is all a mess; it looks like i went around and tore everything out and dumped it in the middle of the floor...  and i have family members using my room saturday night, so i have to get it presentable by then...  but right now i'm going to pass out...  and finish watching Turner and Hooch.  What an awful movie...  what the hell kind of dog is hooch anyway?  a big disgusting drool monster?  eww.  morelater...
