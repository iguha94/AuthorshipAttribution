           so i've been sitting here thinking about whether or not i should call keith (see post below) today as he asked me to (he said, "call me on sunday, even if you have to work") and now i have to share my horoscope and i'm going to need some feedback here, so if anyone reads the page today or tomorrow (cause i'm thinking i might wait until tomorrow to call) they have an obligation to leave a comment or else all of those bad things that chain emails say will happen to you if you don't send them on will happen to you.  here's my "extended horoscope" from   ivillage.com :   Quiet, giving Cancers get another splashy day or in the sun, and you could really use it! Find the time to relax and take care of yourself. Later in the day, love makes you wild and selfish, and everyone stands up and applauds the change. You deserve any good thing that you can create for yourself. Tonight, don't rely on other people to make plans. Take the initiative and revel in the glow of being in command. No one says no to your confident demeanor.  seenow, i'm thinking that the take the initiative part means i should call.  Then i read my "singles love" horoscope (also at   ivillage ):  You'll get what you want. The stars give you the wink. All the elements for a hot romantic time are firmly in place. You feel strong but tender, alive and immortal in this fleeting moment. Speak now or spend your life wishing you had.  seenow, the "speak now" part seems to be pretty much just putting it out there: i should call him.  i dunno though.  oknow, comment away please.
