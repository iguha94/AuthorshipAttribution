         I wish that my blog entries were more lighthearted.  They are always so dang serious, aren't they? Guess that's my style? Let's see....was there anything funny that happened today?   Hm...nope, no. Nothin funny. Except funny grammatical mistakes in my classes, but I won't bore yall with those. hehe  Hm...if I can't write about anything funny, I'll settle with writing about the good ol' mundane....  I went hiking in Kyung Ju last Saturday with some friends, and it was really beautiful! The leaves are changing colors, and I noticed for the first time that the color schema of the Bulguksa temples match the colors of the surrounding trees at autumn.       What else? Well, I played basketball for three freakin hours on Sunday after lunch with a bunch of guys...we played three games.  I was incredibly sore on Monday.    Ro dyed her hair red! She looks soooooo sexy.  I finished the first complete draft of my statement! I was ecstatic, though I guess it's not a big deal.  My friends are reading it right now, but if anyone else would like to help me edit it, please write me a shoutout.  I'll send you the second draft.    My Korean tutor was laughing at me yesterday during our lesson.  I was reading my part of a dialogue out loud, and he kept chuckling over how stiff I sounded.  He kept showing me how to read it naturally, but it just made me so self-conscious that I was butchering syllables all over the place.  I was blushing like crazy.  Man, I'm going to practice that dialogue until I sound like a native-speaker, and boy, am I going to show HIM! ha!  From now on, I am going to try to notice the amusing things in life more.
