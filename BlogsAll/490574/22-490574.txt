         Can I share this letter with you guys? It's from one of my freshmen day students, originally in the form of a cute e-card....it's moments like this that I realize what a special job teaching is....   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hi, Sandra~^^* I'm Hye-Jung in your class. Today we had last class in this semester. I'm put to inconvenience that. I think this semester and this year was so short to me. How time flies!  In school time as a University student student, I thank God to meet good friends, seniors, and  professors. Especially, It's thankful and happy to meet you.  Of course, one semester is very short to know  each other well. But you whom I see through this semester are very warm, pretty and  positive people. When I'm with you, I could feel pleasure and thanks.  You teached me something more than knowledge. -thanksgiving, bright thinking and so on...^^ You are a special to me an all of us. I will remeber you as a good professor, friendly sister, and warm people. ^^  Today I was so happy to have a time  with you and some classmates. It's a precious time to me.  Have a nice weekend and rest time of this semester. And keep your hearth.  I love you in Jesus Christ*^.^*  warmly Jane  --------------------------------------------  After class, Hye Jung and three other girls in the class brought lunch to my office!  I was incredibly touched...I mean, what are they doing buying me lunch? They are poor students!  After eating lunch in my office, I took them to the cafe and we sat around drinking milk tea and eating ice cream.  We had a good time talking, and we took lots of pictures.  :( I am so sad. A lot of the other students wrote the sweetest things on our intranet bulletin board, so much so that I actually teared up....I am really going to miss this class.  Sure, I'll see them around next semester, but it's just not the same as having them in my classroom and seeing them regularly.    They liked the song a lot.  I didn't know this at the time, but when I was explaining why the song was so meaningful to me, one of the male students said that he actually cried....^^!    By the way, if anyone is interested, I think that the version by the group "By the Tree" is the best.
