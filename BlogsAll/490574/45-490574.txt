         Tonight, as I was observing my adult students eagerly going about their tasks in small groups, it hit me afresh how lucky I am to be here at Handong.  I remember that around this time last year, I was interviewing for the job on the phone, and I had no idea what the recruitment coordinator was talking about when he said that I would be teaching "Industrial and Social Education" courses.  I actually think that he was purposely trying to be vague, because it would have been easy enough for him to say that I'd be teaching continuing ed classes for adults.  But I like teaching them.  Tonight they evoked in me a feeling of tenderness as I saw them laughing together and encouraging each other in collaborated creativity.  My day students are cute and spunky, but my night students are persevering and resourceful.  I love them all.  My window is open and I can hear a group of students singing "Here I Am to Worship" in sweet harmony.  Their voices are wafting up through the night air and into my office, making their way into my spirit, uplifting it.   It's been a hard week, for several reasons.  Lately I have felt like a bad teacher, a bad friend, a bad daughter, a bad person.  I know that sounds hyperbolic, but it's honestly how I have felt this week.  I've just felt like a terrible, weak sinner in many ways.  I guess that the Lord is bringing me to the place again where I need to find my strength, and everything good in me, in HIM.  If there is anything that I know right now, at this moment, it's that I NEED Him.
