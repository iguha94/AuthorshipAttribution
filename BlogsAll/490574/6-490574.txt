         HEY ALL!  I am back from Europe! But I am leaving for Korea tonight! Agh! I can't even begin to describe all the emotions I've been riding for the past couple of days. But anyways, at JoeMo's request, I wanted to update my blog (thanks for the note Joe!!!). :)   hehe, but you know, I can't fully update it right now because I am in a crazy mess trying to get everything packed. But I just wanted to let you all know where I've been, where I am, and where I'll be. So yup, I was in Paris for a month, learning French, and also traveled to England and Italy for a couple of weeks. It was incredible! Beautiful! And I learned soooo much about myself and about my God.  More on that later. Now I am going to Korea to teach at Handong Global University for one year! I am super nervous and apprehensive, but at the same time, excited and happy to be going. So I've been in LA for only 5 days, and I've just been seeing everyone I can down here and eating all the foods I know that I won't be able to find in Korea. ;)   It's been a rad summer, I tell ya! :)  Thanks for the care package everyone! It was so awesome! I filled my entire new album with all the pictures and notes you guys gave me. It made me miss all of you again soooo much! :) Oh and Chang, dude, thanks so much for the new set of sermon CD's and the John Owens book. Did you know that the other sermon CD's you gave me were like lifesavers in Europe for me and my friend??? And Keith, the frame is gorgeous...don't know about the pic in the middle of it :), but I looove the frame.  Ifang, thanks again for organizing the care package, and for visiting me here in LA!  Ok, all, I will definitely try to write a more thorough entry once I get to Korea. Whoa...I'll be bloggin from KOREA.
