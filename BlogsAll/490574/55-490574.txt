         What a whirlwind of a weekend.  The most salient moment, however, was Saturday night, when I saw spoken word poet Dennis Kim perform at the Grand Star in Chinatown.    It was absolutely mind-shaking and heart-trembling.  Most of the evening had been loud music, dancing, and hip-hop freestyle units.  But  when he started reading, this heavy hush blanketed over the room, and he just soared with words, words, piercing words.  His poetry is about the beauty and uniqueness of all that is Korean, what it means to be Korean American, what it means to be American, about social justice and spiritual truth.   Twice, or three times, he broke out into the refrains of traditional Korean folk songs that were weaved into his poems.  Whenever he did that, it was such a mesmerizing space of time in which the husky, deep,  true  quality of his voice and the slight american accent with which he sang those refrains that encapsulate the quintessential  maht  of Korea, somehow resonated profoundly, and painfully, with  who I  am  .  During those spells, a vague part of me, which I am not fully in touch with yet but which is deep within my center, just wanted to weep and weep.  I found out that he was also born in '78,  na-rang dong-gap .  That fact somehow struck me as inexplicably warming.  With an unspoken and spiritual  jeong , I feel that he is a brother.  His artistry and passion remind me of how powerful, how beautiful, how  real  poetry can be.    The hungry scent of sorrow on the skin of my people, Han.  The muddy face of my unborn children. Han.  My crooked foot searching for the footprints of my grandfather.  My Han.
