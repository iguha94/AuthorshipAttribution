         25...that sounds strangely weighty.  Maybe that's because in math class we always rounded up.  25 seems closer to 30, while 24 seems closer to 20.  25 is half of 50.  A quarter of 100.    A quarter of a century.  Have I really lived that long?  Can I say that I've done all that I had wanted to do by 25?  Surprisingly, yes.  But that's because I had no idea what I wanted for my life until three years ago.  Almost exactly three years ago, I went to Urbana little knowing that it would forever change my life trajectory.  Life is so different when you have a dream.    So let's see.  Let's start there.  In those three years, I graduated from college, broke up with someone whom I had thought I would marry, worked as a teacher at a California high school for a year, and moved out to Korea to teach at a university for two years. Along the way, I've said goodbye to and have met some spectacular people who've inspired me to live life to the fullest.  I'd say that I don't regret one thing about the past three years.        I'm looking ahead to the next 25 years though.  There is now much that I would like to accomplish in that time: - Finish grad school and be well-equipped for overseas ministry. - Become fully trilingual (I have a long way to go, but hey, I have 25 years, right?!), if not quadralingual (depending on the country God leads me to), with an adequate knowledge of French and Latin in addition. - Go overseas as a tentmaker. - Publish articles/books that point to Truth, redeeming in at least a small way ideas that have been corrupted by the world, and trusting my Christian worldview to help me see art, beauty, philosophy, and humanity more clearly.  - Continue to develop pedagogical methods that somehow reveal the image of God in man, and man's need for God, in my teaching of literature.  This will most likely have to be an indirect approach that prods students to think about their own presuppositions and values and worldview, in which a relational follow-up would open doors for me to share the gospel on a personal level, outside the classroom. - Marry an awesome man who thinks integratively and artistically and who loves the Lord, and have a few babies. :) - Love people and see them come to know and love the Lord.  By the time I am 50, I want to be able to look back and say, "Christ Jesus has been and is and always will be the LORD of my life."  What is important in this life?  I love the verse in Psalm 42:    Deep calls unto deep at the noise of Your waterfalls; all your waves and billows have gone over me.     That to me crystallizes what life is about.  The hollow depths of man calling out to the ineffable and beautiful depths of God.  God longing to fill the depth of man's emptiness with the depth of His perfect love.  The "noise of [His] waterfalls" is the abundance of evidence of Him in all the world; "[His] waves and billows [going] over me" is the overwhelming and breathtaking nature of His bewildering grace.    The material world is only the backdrop for a spiritual reality.  The spirit world is what will remain when all else passes away, so that's what I want live for.    Happy birthday to me!   Nevertheless I am continually with You;  You hold me by my right hand.  You will guide me with Your counsel,  And afterward receive me to glory.   Whom have I in heaven but You?  And there is none upon earth that I desire besides You.  My flesh and my heart fail;  But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.   For indeed, those who are far from You shall perish;  You have destroyed all those who desert You for harlotry.  But it is good for me to draw near to God;  I have put my trust in the Lord GOD,  That I may declare all Your works.   Psalm 73:23-28
