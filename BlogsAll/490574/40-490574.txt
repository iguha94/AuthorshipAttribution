         Today people all around the world are celebrating the most important moment in the history of humankind: the day Jesus Christ arose from the dead.  I got a picture of that today at Handong's English Service.  Some international students from Russia, China, and Fiji sang special praise songs in their languages, a student from China's Yanbian University gave an amazing testimony of how she was saved, the president of Handong sang all four verses of the hymn Amazing Grace in English, the head chaplain recited all of Matthew 1 in English, and a korean hip hop group on campus performed the drama of Christ's resurrection in our lives in a most innovative and creative theatrical dance routine.  My eyes kept tearing throughout the service, because the beauty of the gospel was so overwhelming in light of God's work in the world at large.  He IS alive, and the Body of Christ in the world grows in number, in unity, and in vision, as He works in each individual believer's life.  Those international students were brought by God to Handong, just as I was 9 months ago, and it is just such an honor to meet them, if only to serve as a reminder to me that there is so much more than just  here .    God is taking variegated threads of rich colors and rare materials, weaving them together into a special tapestry, splendid beyond imagination. You and I are a part of that.        But he said to them, "Do not be alarmed.  You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified.  He is risen!  He is not here.  See the place where they laid Him." Mark 16:6
