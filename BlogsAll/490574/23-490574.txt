         My last frosh day class is tomorrow morning, 10 am.  I have goodies and fruit ready for them, as well as a song that I am going to teach them.  It's kind of old, called "Your Beloved".  If you want to know why this song has special significance to me, especially in light of being at Handong, please read the following archive:    http://sandita.blogspot.com/2002_06_01_sandita_archive.html   I think it is the perfect way to end my first semester at Handong.    Here are the lyrics:   Lord it was You who Created the heavens Lord it was Your hand That put the stars in their place  Lord it is Your voice That commands the morning Even oceans and their waves             Bow at Your feet Lord who am I Compared to Your glory, Oh Lord  Lord who am I Compared to Your majesty I am Your beloved Your creation And You love me as I am                      You have called me chosen for Your kingdom     Unashamed to call me Your own              I am Your beloved    I guess it's not _totally_ the end tomorrow...this day class and I are planning on hanging out the evening of the last day of finals.  They're so cute...they want to take me out downtown! ^;^  shout out to Allen: Thanks for calling me dude.  You made my day. ^^
