         AAAAGH! I am all set.  Going to Samara Beach in Costa Rica for a language program, Jan. 10 to Feb. 8.  The trip altogether costs less than 2 grand, so I think that I got a good deal.  The best thing about the program: daily latin dance classes included in the tuition! It can't get any better than that. ;)    As for outreach/missions programs in L. America, when I was researching I found out that it's too late to apply.  They all require apps two months in advance, but two months ago I was in the thick of grad apps.  There was no way.  I am sad about it, because it seems like I won't have the chance to go on any mission trips in the near future.  But then again, Allen said something last night that made my calling seem so real: I have a lifetime ahead of me.  True, true.  He also said that being in Korea is something like missions, at least in giving me a taste of what it's like to live overseas, doing God's work, for an extended period of time.  That's true too.      Still, maybe I can go somewhere next summer....although, I have to do a korean language program before entering grad school.  And I am going to Thailand with Inna.  Oh oh oh where are my priorities! :)   Well, Merry Christmas everyone!
