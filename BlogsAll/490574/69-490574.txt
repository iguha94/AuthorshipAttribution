         I just wrote an email to the woman who was my mentor teacher at Menlo School, where I was an intern my first year out of college.    She recently had a miscarriage.  Another  miscarriage.  She had her first miscarriage when I was working at Menlo, and I took over for her full-time for about two months while she was out recovering both physically and emotionally.    The last email I got from her was news that she was pregnant again.  She had sounded so hopeful, so happy.  Her doctor basically required that she stay in bed for nine months, just to be on the safe side the second time around.  I couldn't believe it when I heard that she had lost the second baby.  It was devastating, and I had not been able to write her right away.  But today, almost three months later, I finally sent the email.  I feel desolate inside.  I wrote that email feeling like there was nothing I could offer her, not even true sympathy, because doesn't true sympathy require some empathy? What do I know about what it feels like to lose a baby -- twice???  All I could offer her in all sincerity were my prayers.  And a poem.  I don't know why I felt like sending her the "to dream" poem, but I did.    I did write  Keep dreaming , which might end up seeming trite and like a non sequitur to her.  But in the moment, that was all I could come up with from the deepest part of my heart.  To me, the most tragic thing that could happen was not so much the loss of the child, but the loss of hope.  Life without hope is empty, and when I try to imagine the  emptiness  she must be feeling, I feel immensely sad.     Keep dreaming , what else could I say?
