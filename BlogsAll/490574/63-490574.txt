         I read an interesting blog by a random person that I don't know on Danny's jack.html.  He was talking about "God's complete lack of empathy" and was claiming that "[God] cannot reason with man, nor can they achieve mutual understanding. Empathy between man and God is  impossible ." He goes on to talk about the implications of this as a believer, and that like God, empathy is "contrary to the nature of the believer" since it is often linked to the "communal toleration and glorification of what it is to be human--to sin."  This guy had a very compelling   argument , but I have to disagree completely.    I found a couple of contradictions in his argument.  First of all, if we are made in the image of God (which he does discuss earlier in a different context), then how could we not have empathy with God? The ways in which we bear resemblance to our Creator evince His COMMUNICABLE (a word that implies connection, empathy) attributes, like intelligence, love, creativity, happiness, etc.  Granted, there are aspects of God's character that the human mind can not grasp, such as His omniscience or eternality or timelessness, but this does not make Him completely inscrutable.  This person further contradicts himself in that, if humans can't have empathy  with  God, than how could believers be  like  God in His so-called lack of empathy?  The truth of the matter is actually quite glaring: JESUS IS THE EPITOME OF GOD'S EMPATHY WITH HUMANKIND.  He didn't sin, but He "was tempted in every way...":    Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted.  Hebrews 2:17-18   For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we areyet was without sin.  Hebrews 4:15  The blogger made the point that "empathy is the basis of [human] justice,"  but I would argue that if that's true,  divine  empathy is the basis of grace, and the kind of  holy  justice that mingles love, righteousness, and mercy.  If Christ's death and resurrection within us is not the supreme and most perfect example of empathy, then I don't know what is.  Now how does this look in the real world as a believer? I agree with the blogger that we must reject sin because it is contrary to the nature of regeneration to live in the flesh.  But that is not to say that we do not struggle with sin, and it is the very struggle with sin that allows us to understand and reach out to the unsaved in HUMILITY.  We don't condone sin, but we understand it, or else we wouldn't understand the profundity of grace.  The guy cites Paul as an example of one who lost the faculty of empathy once saved, but I beg to differ.  Paul sees his sin all the more clearly (Romans 7!!!), to the point of despair, but what could follow such a face-off with sin, except the glorious truth of Romans 8?     Those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?...Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?...For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.    Could there be anyone in the Bible who understood the love of God more than Paul?  Did not this deep understanding of God's love, and the godly empathy with humankind which such understanding produced, compel Paul to devote his life to reaching the world with the radical, life-changing truth that is the gospel?        The end of the gospel is not to eliminate sin, which I believe is the fulcrum of this guy's argument.  No, the end of the gospel is to bring unworthy people into an inconceivable  relationship   with a most holy and loving God, through Jesus, who is the quintessential expression of perfect, divine empathy.
