         The swing festival this past weekend was amazing!    Highlight of the evening:  Dancing with Japan's "father of swing,"  who came as a guest.  Incredible! You know that a lead is darn good when he makes YOU feel like a pro.  Charles had videotaped me dancing with some other guys, but he missed this one! What I would have given to get that on tape!  Lowlight of the evening:  Dancing with this one dude and not knowing what THE HECK he was doing and feeling really stupid.  He seemed really good when dancing with other girls, so it must've been me. :(  All in all though, it was a high.  I got over my complex about asking guys to dance and was asking people left and right(guys are especially a minority at swing or salsa events in Korea).  Often it's a "hit or miss" kind of thing....like sometimes the guy dances super well and is an awesome lead, and other times the guy is a beginner who can't keep rhythm.  And sometimes their level is way over my head and I can't follow.  Or sometimes they are so sweaty that it's gross.  I was telling Jean in the car that I couldn't GET swing for the longest time.  And then, one day, swinging at a club in SF, something  clicked .  It was like a moment of epiphany when the movements I had learned and memorized actually made sense with the music.  Once that happened, it was like I could improvise to no end.  The same thing happened to me with salsa.  It just  clicked  one night at CoCoMo.    I still feel really nervous before swing or salsa dancing, especially because in Korea I can go about twice a year at the most.  I always feel like I must've forgotten how to dance, and usually the first dance  is  mediocre. But then it  clicks  again, and I'm seriously flying.    *sigh* I LOVE dancing.
