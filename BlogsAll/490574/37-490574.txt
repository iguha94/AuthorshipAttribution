         Wow, thanks for all the great comments everyone.  You had a lot of valid points and cogent arguments.  I totally understand Slim &co who say that safer is better than unwittingly getting tangled in an unhealthy emotional mess .  But I also appreciate Jan's and Martin's comments-- that there is some refreshing beauty and freedom in letting down protective guards (which jan so insightfully pointed out is often more a product of pride than actual "protection"; in my case I think that I am the one acting on a pride that might be sinful, although jan is probably right that men could be more honest about their motivations too), and in letting another person get just close enough to see the ugly (how did you know that I was a weirdo, Martin? hehe I thought that I hid it pretty well).     So my conclusion? I'm still not quite sure.  Talked to Jess again, and she made a good point that you deal with each person uniquely because everyone is different.  And I think that that's what I am going to adjust. Instead of having a sweeping, rigorous methodology with men, I am going to go with the flow more and follow my natural inclinations a little more.  But just a  little  more, because I recognize that there is always the danger that Slim pointed out of getting emotionally involved in a way that should only be reserved for my husband.  I don't ever want to get that intimate in a friendship with a guy until I meet, you know,  him .  Basically this all means that I am going to keep doing what I have been doing, but leaving more room for what I previously called "exceptions", so that they are no longer "exceptions", but just my clos-"er" guy friends. But my best friends will always be women until I get married.  to the other chi:  you'll be leaving for korea just when I'll have gotten back!  i'll prolly be back june 20 or 21! but you'll still be here in korea when I return, since i should be back mid august. i guess we could hang out in seoul then. miss ya.
