         The weather is acting strange.  It rained all day long, and the winds have been blowing ferociously since midafternoon.  It made for a beautiful sight, actually.  Whenever I would look out the window, this eerie mist was hovering over everything...the trees, now brilliantly green, madly thrashing about, the wet ground shining....  I don't have any classes on Wednesdays, so since my 2 hour departmental meeting ended around 2:30, I've just been chillin at home.  Jess was gone to town all evening, so I made use of the privacy and snuggled up on the couch, dimmed the lights, read for several hours, napped, watched some korean dramas, and read again.  Today I decided to take a break from grading and prepping altogether.  I've been reading the collected works of St. John of the Cross, a Spanish mystic monk from the 16th century.  While I don't agree with the theology he espouses in his prose (you know, arduous ascetism and the disassociation of the spirit from anything earthly) I think that his poetry is absolutely beautiful.  They have the original Spanish in the back, so after I read the poems in English, I began reading them aloud in Spanish.  That, along with the wind howling outside, shaking the windows from time to time, made for quite a mysterious mood.    One thing that strikes me about the mystics was their uncanny ability to grasp, or should I say experience, the ineffable love of God.  This is one thing that their constant removal from the daily distractions of the world could have afforded them, I suppose.  Regarding one of his poems, which a nun asked him to explain, St. John wrote, "I have felt...somewhat reluctant to explain these four stanzas as you asked.  Since they deal with matters so interior and spiritual, for which words are usually lacking--  in that the spiritual surpasses sense-- I find it difficult to say something of their content; also one speaks badly of the intimate depths of the spirit if one does not do so with a deeply recollected soul."     The poem he is referring to is called "The Living Flame of Love,"  which describes the ecstatic, intimate union of the soul with God.  O living flame of love That tenderly wounds my soul In its deepest center! Since Now You are not oppressive, Now Consummate! if it be Your will: Tear through the veil of this sweet encounter!  O sweet cautery, O delightful wound! O gentle hand! O delicate touch That tastes of eternal life           And pays every debt!                In killing You changed death to life.  O lamps of fire!                              In whose splendors The deep caverns of feeling, Once obscure and blind, Now give forth, so rarely, so exquisitely, Both warm and light to their Beloved.       How gently and lovingly You wake in my heart,  Where in secret You dwell alone;   And in Your sweet breathing,         Filled with good and glory, How tenderly You swell my heart with love.  I understand what he means about explaining poetry.  I don't think that I could really fully explain any of my poems to anyone.  I wrote them for the very reason that I could not articulate what I was feeling or thinking at the moment in prosaic language. I write for myself more than anyone, so I know that a lot of times people might read my poetry page and wonder what the heck I am talking about.....oh well. It's a form of expression for me, not necessarily communication.  Of course, if it does communicate anything to anyone, then that gives me pleasure too.   But I  get  his poem.  To me, it is brilliant. While I was reading it, along with his much longer poem "The Spiritual Canticle,"  my heart began to beat faster as the magnificence of the love of God washed over me....especially in the dulcet tones of Spanish...  Oh llama de amor viva, Que tiernamente hieres, De mi alma en el mas profundo centro! Pues ya no eres esquiva, Acaba ya, si quieres; Rompe la tela de este dulce encuentro.  Oh cauterio suave! Oh regalada llaga!                   Oh mano blanda! Oh toque delicado, Que a vida eterna sabe, Y toda deuda paga!  Matando, muerte en vida la has trocado.   Oh lamparas de fuego,   En cuyos resplandores   Las profundas cavernas del sentido,  Que estaba oscuro y ciego, Con extranos primores Calor y luz dan junto a su Querido!  Cuan manso y amoroso Recuerdas en mi seno Donde secretamente solo moras; Y en tu aspirar sabroso De bien y gloria lleno Cuan delicadamente me enamoras!
