         Wow, I won't have time to do even half of the things I had wanted to do in LA.  At breakfast yesterday morning, my mom says to me, "Why don't you go visit your sister in D.C. before she leaves in June?"   I'm like, "Are you serious? I have no money umma; I'm going to Costa Rica, remember?"  She quickly offers to pay for the plane ticket as my birthday/Christmas present, leaving me wide-eyed.    My first impulse was to say, no way, I'll be too tired from traveling so much. But then, after a moment's thought, it suddenly seemed like a good idea.  I mean, I'm completely done with apps, so there's nothing hanging over my head.  I haven't been east in ages, and I would love to check out where my cool sister works (she works with the FBI). I could go see Carm in Maryland.  I could see Harold preach in Virginia and finally meet his wife and newborn baby.  So after scouring the internet for flight deals, I bought the ticket tonight. I'm going! Crazy, isn't it?  My sister was sitting in my room as I was confirming the purchase, and I said,"I can't believe I am doing this." I don't know, as I motioned to click the "purchase this flight" button, I felt all giddy about being so spontaneous, about totally changing my plans in one day.  I had been so completely  un -spontaneous and  super -responsible since June because of grad school stuff, that doing this was like a breath of release.  It hit me, I can do  whatever I want !  For now, I don't have any responsibilities or deadlines looming in the horizon, and it feels GOOD.  Life is good. Wish me fun.  Another highlight: I'll still get to eat prime rib before going back to Korea.  Mon's taking me to a Ruth Chris's by her place! yummmmyum.
