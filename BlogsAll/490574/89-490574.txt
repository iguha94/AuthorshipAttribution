         I just gave my blog address, as well as Scott's, to one of my students! This is my first time doing that.  Michael, you better feel special. ^^    Michael came to visit me during office hours, and we were conferencing about his essay, which is due on Tuesday.  The essay topic is "three characteristics you look for in a spouse."  After working through his draft and finding ways in which he could improve his writing, we just started chatting about how he met his girlfriend and whether or not he was old enough to be thinking about marriage (he's a sophomore).  Of course, he ended up asking me if I was thinking about marriage, and I went ahead and told him all about Scott.  hehe.    It was a different experience from the other zillion times that I've told the story however, because this student actually studied one of Scott's stories, "Garlic," in my class last semester, and wrote an in-class essay on his poem, "Moon in the Trees"!  He was completely shocked when I told him that the author of those works is the person I met and fell in love with just this past January.  It amazed him that I hardly knew Scott at the time we were studying his material in November.  It tickled him that I had met the mother who is the subject of "Moon in the Trees,"  that indeed she is going to be my mother-in-law. hahahahahahahahaha!  I promised Michael that someday I'd show Scott what he wrote about the poem in his in-class essay.    I definitely need to write my own version of our story one of these days.
