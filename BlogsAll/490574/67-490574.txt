         A beautiful winter day.  Not a cloud in the sky, the sun shining brilliantly.  Cold, crisp air.  Elegant leafless trees.  Frosty puddles that take you by surprise.      I am happy today.  I was walking down the hill from my apartment this afternoon, when all of a sudden I realized that I had this stupid grin on my face.  That struck me as unbelievably funny, which then made me laugh aloud!   This week was refreshing and fulfilling.  As I mentioned in the shout-out to James, the sermon last Sunday made me realize how self-centered I've been.  So this past week I have made a deliberate effort to pray more, and to pray more for  others .  Praying has been hard for me for awhile now, but it hit me how urgent it is to pray for the world and for the people in my life.  I also made time in my day to just worship God with my voice and my guitar, something that I used to do so regularly, not out of duty, but out of a sheer overflow from my heart.  Somehow I have lost that, and for the past few days I have tried to recapture the intangible unspeakable in my soul by focusing on who HE IS again.      And now I feel a quiet, fundamental difference.  But it happened all at once, unexpectedly, today.  Walking down that hill.  It's the feeling of changing the lens in an old pair of glasses...you don't quite realize how long you've been seeing things unclearly until you are able to see crystal clear again.  It was as if the video of my life had suddenly zoomed out, almost out-of-body-like, and for a brief moment I saw my life for what it is.  And, in the same astounding and breathtaking moment, I saw God for who HE IS.  An instant.  Gone.    But it was enough.  I feel strangely filled, and maybe I'm in love again.
