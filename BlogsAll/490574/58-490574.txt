         What a week! The first week of classes was quite a whirlwind, but I am really excited about the Reading and Discussion class that I am teaching.  I am excited about integrating worldview, faith, and maybe even philosophy into the discussions of literary pieces in their reader.  This is amazing, because I am actually training for the very kind of thing I will be doing as a comparative literature professor in the future.  I've only been teaching communication classes up until this point, so this is a most refreshing and appropriate change.  My goal this semester is not so much about making the classroom fun, as it is about making my students really think.  I want them to encounter their own culture with a new perspective by being confronted with a foreign one; I want them to engage in the process of discovering their own presuppositions, many of which they might not be aware.    But tomorrow morning I am off again to the States for Eunice's wedding.  It's crazy, because I am only going to be there for a day and a half before I have to fly back!  I am so happy to be able to witness one of my dearest friends get married though.  She is "the first to go" from my inner circle of girlfriends.  It's going to be very weird to see her plunge into marriagedom....
