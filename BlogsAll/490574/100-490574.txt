         I have been meditating on the names of God this week.  The book  Experiencing God  has a great list in its appendix that surveys all the names and titles of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit in the Bible.  That, coupled with a stimulating conversation I had with Scott at the beginning of the week about theological issues, really had me dwelling on the  nature  of God as revealed through  history .  It occurred to me that God had to take all of history to clarify His Holy, Triune nature for rebellious, ungrateful, depraved, blind, yet  beloved  mankind.  The people of God only understood Him as God the Righteous Judge, the Provider, the great I AM in the Old Testament, and it wasn't until Jesus' life that they began to understand Him as God the Father  and  God the Son. "I and My Father are one," was Jesus' special message.  And it was only after Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, that the people of God received the penetrating ministry of the Holy Spirit.     We now have the full revelation of God, and His Spirit  dwells within us .  The people of the Old Testament were also saved by faith, but the difference was that the yearly sacrifices performed by the priests were only "a matter of...  external  regulations applied until the time of the new order" (Heb 9:10).  The first tabernacle was an illustration for "the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the  conscience  of the worshipper" (vs 9).  In other words, the sacrifices were a constant reminder of man's slavery to his sinful nature, since they had to be performed annually.  The law laid the groundwork for the new convenant by revealing the seriousness of sin in God's sight,  the necessity of atonement for sin against the holiness of God, and the necessity of a mediator between God and man.  It was with this indispensable backdrop that Jesus entered the world's stage as the bright Lamb of God, and it was through the offering of His own body that "we have been sanctified once and for all" (Heb 10:10), forever freed from our bondage to sin and death.  It was so that He could "perfect" (vs 14) us in His image by a complete internal revolution that Jesus died and was resurrected.  We are now free to be slaves to God, inextricably bound to Him, which He achieved not by chains, but by making  us  His "temple" (1 Cor 3:16), His "building" (1 Cor 3:9), His "field" (1 Cor 3:9), His "home" (Jn 14:23), His own BODY.  This He could only accomplish by becoming fully human, living a sinless life, dying for the world, and being raised again to life, effectively undoing the cursed Fall of man once and for all.  Jesus had to die because He was fully human.  Jesus had to be resurrected because He was fully divine and completely sinless.  He CONQUERED sin and death by virtue of Himself because there was  no other way .  Love required human free will, and that free will led to sin, but even free will and sin couldn't stop the invincible loving will of God.  He is the ultimate author and finisher of our faith because we couldn't have been saved any other way and still experience True Love.    If He were still walking among us, He wouldn't be living  within  us.                Meditating on the wonderful array of names that reveal who He is, it is evident that the Father's characteristics are distinct from the Son's characteristics, both of which are distinct from the Holy Spirit's characteristics.  Is this to say that God is not One but three? Certainly not! It reveals the immaculate, blinding beauty of holy diversity within unity, the glorious multi-dimensionality and infinite  depth  of God.  Our puny minds could  not  have been able to comprehend God at all, if He had chosen to reveal Himself  all at once .  He is so infinitely and beautifully deep and wide and layered and complex in His Holy, Triune nature, that to know Him in full revelation required its outworking in finite time for finite beings.  So He made it into the greatest story of all, weaving it throughout the history of the world, that we might know Him  intimately .    God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit has always been both transcendent and immanent, but took the necessary time for the full revelation of His Beauty.  He drew closer and closer to man, until finally the day would come when He'd offer up His own life to save us from ourselves.  That God would  die  is profound, but that He would be raised again to life in order to  make His home with us  is utterly amazing.  This is the essence of, as Chesterton so perfectly described it,  the reckless, raging fury of the love of God  that has been relentlessly pursuing us since the beginning of time.    "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance...Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation." (2 Peter 3)  "On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you." (Jn 14:20)
