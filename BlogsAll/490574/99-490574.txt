         I am teaching mostly writing this semester.  Two sections of  Grammar and Composition , four sessions a week in the Writing Lab.  It's ok, but I really miss teaching lit.  Looking back at last semester, my job was my life because it just lit me up to see the minds and souls of my students unravel before me as we plumbed the human condition through literary art.  And because this is Korea, each class was not only a lesson in reading and discussion, but often also a trenchant cultural encounter.    Compared to that, teaching writing is much too technical, methodical, precise, and dry for my taste.  We are going through the process of writing reaction essays at the moment, and I was pleased to find that the textbook unit includes Dylan Thomas'  Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night.   In the book, it's merely presented as an example of a written prompt that can incite a deep and thoughtful reaction from the reader, but I seized upon it to teach a poetry lesson.    I have always loved that particular poem, but I love it more now after having taught it to my classes.  The students absolutely blew me away with their interpretations of Thomas' obscure images and conflicted, passionate elocution.  There was this one girl who took the image of    Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright  Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay Rage, rage against the dying of the light.   and interlaced the sounds and dynamism of the ocean's waves splashing into a bay with its likeness to human frailty and the psychological journey toward death.  She even got up and drew a visual representation on the whiteboard.  It's for moments like that that I dream of becoming a comp lit prof.     Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night  is a decisively difficult poem, but I find that sometimes advanced ESL students are forced to be more analytical with literature than native speakers.  Without even being aware of the conventions of the "close-reading" method in literary analysis, they end up close-reading a poem just because they have to deal with the multiple definitions of words to even understand the poem at a basic level.  This involved analytical process sometimes comes to a thrilling fruition of layered, complex interpretations that are often far more sophisticated than you'd expect from ESL students.  I always seem to learn so much more from my students than they learn from me. . .*sigh* when I'm teaching lit.             Joyce told me today that it seems like I am not fully  here .  "Other-worldly" is the euphemism she used.  She was saying that for her and Ro, their world is as big as Handong, and whereas that  used  to be true for me, it's no longer so.  She's right, half the time my head is in the clouds, dreaming of what is to come.  Half of my heart feels like it is beating on the other side of the planet.  I wish that I could be  here  as passionately and as committedly as I was last semester.  But it's time to go, and everything seems to be signalling that imminent departure.  From the timely life-changing discovery of love in the winter, to my dry teaching schedule this semester, to the fact that all my good friends here are also leaving Handong in June...it's just all one long, drawn-out goodbye.
