         So I'm feeling calmer now.  It's been a productive day and things for my classes are pretty set.  I could always do more, but I figure that stressing myself out is not a good idea.    I am really really REALLY excited about this semester.  I'll be busier than ever, but doing things that I love.  Besides teaching classes I'll be:  - Leading a small group on apologetics. - Singing on the praise team for the international service. - Practicing swing-dancing with a partner using some videos, and maybe even performing at the Festival. - Organizing a North Korea prayer group.  - Training with a missions group on campus that focuses on spreading the gospel through the arts, and helping them prepare for the summer trip.  Lately I've been feeling a little sad that I'll be leaving all of this in just a few months.  I've come to adore Handong, and Pohang feels like home.  I am appreciating every single day, and all the little details that I had taken for granted are striking me as precious.  And yet, a long-distance relationship is not ideal, and I have A LOT to look forward to once I get back to the States.  When it comes down to it, I know that it is time to move on.  This semester feels markedly different; it is very special because of the very fact that it is the very last.    God's timing is truly amazing.  At the end of last semester, I was asking myself, "How on earth am I going to leave this place!?" absolutely horrified at the thought.  But during the three months that I was gone, my life changed completely, and all of a sudden, I am already saying goodbye with my foot halfway out the door.  It'll still be hard to leave, but that my heart has found its home makes it much easier.  These next few months will be a time of savoring and remembering, letting go and passing on, hoping and dreaming.  I really wouldn't have my last semester here any other way, and I guess God knew that before I did.
