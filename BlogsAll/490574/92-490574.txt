         The Korean Parliament voting to impeach President Ro. Bombings in Madrid. The crazy US elections. The crisis in the Middle East. People starving and dying in North Korea. The HIV epidemic in Africa. The list goes on.  What a world, and here I am going crazy in my own world.    My mind has been running in circles and swinging wildly on a pendulum as I try to figure out what's going on after I leave Korea.  Yesterday I was getting married in October and putting off grad school for a couple of years.  This morning I was going to USC in the fall, dropping out at the end of one academic year, and getting married next May.  Now it looks like I might be in Vancouver for a year instead, getting a Masters instead of a PhD, and getting married next July.  Who knows what tomorrow will bring?    I want to take things "one step at a time," but that's not so easy when you feel like there are twenty possible steps you could take for that  next  step, you know what I mean?    Am I any closer to the right decision? Oops, I meant  we .  I keep talking to Scott in the first person.     Lord help me.  I feel so self-centered when I think about the world  out there , and how little I am actually making a difference.  I need to pray.
