         I have laryngitis.  I am croaking around like a frog.  How am I going to teach come Monday???  I started feeling a sore throat on Monday, and it has just gotten progressively worse with all the singing, talking, yelling, and laughing I've been doing this past week.  I need to rest my voicebox and drink a lot of water, so says the website on home treatment for health problems.   The performance on Wednesday night went pretty well, considering that it was raining (perfect for our first piece, I guess...we were literally getting wet as we were singing, "A Little Fall of Rain") and the sound system wasn't too hot.  But Abraham and I were received enthusiastically by the students.  They were woohing and aahing and clapping all over the place, as Koreans love to do. And, it was the first time in my life that I wasn't nervous performing in front of a large audience!  I couldn't believe it.  I felt totally comfortable on stage. Maybe I am finally over the stage fright that has plagued me all my life! In that respect, the experience was quite exhilarating for me personally.  Besides that, the Food Festival was a blast, and our food turned out well.  We sold out of tortilla espanola and ceviche in like ten minutes! But more than our own cooking, the highlight for me was tasting Fijian chicken slow-cooked in the ground.  Delicious.  The MT was cancelled due to bad weather, but my students called me yesterday and I am going to hang out with some of them tonight since it's beautiful today.  Wonder how they are going to understand me when my English speaking friends can hardly understand my croaking? Hehe, it'll make for an interesting experience I'm sure.  Not a very interesting entry, I know, but thought I'd just jot down an update.  I know that my last entry was only four days ago, but it seriously seems like a month has passed since then.
