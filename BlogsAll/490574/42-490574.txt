         Today Ro and I sat under a quaint cherry blossom tree with our brown bag lunches.  There was a pleasant breeze, so that every so often a lone petal would drift onto my head, or my shoulder, and Ro would pick it off.  We had such an easy, comfortable conversation.    Ro is gorgeous.   In the first few months of knowing her I never noticed, but as I have gotten to know her better, her beauty radiates.  Maybe even moreso because she doesn't even know it.  There is such this unassuming air about her that is almost captivating.  Joyce and I were hounding her the other day about what kind of man she'd like to marry someday.  She doesn't know.  Her first experience of puppy love was fleeting and innocent, and she didn't pursue it or any other relationship because she knew that she wasn't ready.  She did say though,  I haven't ever felt that I needed a man, but I know that when I meet him, I'll need him.   I love that.  That's Ro.  Quietly confident, romantic in her own way, the converse of the manipulative archetypal Eve.  Her personality is as feminine and soft as it is adventuresome and bold.  It's spring, and the cherry blossoms are now in full bloom.  What Ro doesn't know is that they reminded me of her, even as she was picking them off of me.   cherry blossom, take off from the bark pure, fresh, delicate dancing with the breeze,  slowly,  gently, wafting  down to the  wide wide earth, ready.
