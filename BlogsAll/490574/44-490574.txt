         Last night I cried my eyes out to Joyce.  I feel better now.  Today I am just going to relax by myself, spend a long time with the Lord, and maybe go into town later so that I can study Korean and read Kant in a cafe.  I wanted to share one quote that I read last night in Ravi Zacharias' book,  Cries of the Heart  (he is quoting Martin Lloyd-Jones'  Spiritual Depression ):   The main art in the matter of spiritual living is to know how to handle yourself.  You have to take yourself in hand.  You have to address yourself, preach to yourself, question yourself.  The essence of this matter is to understand that this self of ours, this other man within us, has got to be handled.  Do not listen to him; turn on him; speak to him; condemn him; upbraid him; exhort him; encourage him; remind him of what you know instead of placidly listening to him and allowing him to drag you down and depress you.   These words were so right on for me last night.  I've been "placidly listening" to the lies that Satan has been telling me about me.  It has brought me down, and yesterday was the lowest.  Everything seemed to go wrong and by the end of the day I felt defeated, useless, and sinful.  Joyce was such a sweetheart-- she really listened to me with empathy and sympathy, which is what I needed.  I can feel her prayers for me.  Today will be different.  I am going to meditate on God's truth and let Him tell me who I am.
