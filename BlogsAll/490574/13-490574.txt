         I'm tired. Midterms are coming up. Just finished writing a test, and typing up a poem. Going home now, even though I told myself that it was about time I updated my blog.  I don't know, I've been sad this week (well, it's only Tuesday).  Just some random things happened yesterday that put me in a strange mood.  And it's too beautiful outside. It's so beautiful it hurts. Really bad. I took a walk today on a trail behind my apartment building that I had not been on before.  It's by far the best trail at Handong.  I think I'll walk there everyday while the weather is nice, because it is restorative. So pretty and peaceful.  Today the air was crisp and cool, the sun shining through the trees, and me all alone. With God, but all alone in body.  It was very very quiet, save the steady chirping of crickets, the buzzing of bees, and the wind rustling the trees. I prayed to Him who loves me and cares for me, the kind of praying where it feels like your heart is reaching as far as possible, and I especially prayed about the people that I love who are struggling.  And then I just felt incredibly lonely.  I wanted to scream and cry at the same time, but all I could do was let my eyes fill with tears.  I feel like this is the same story over again from my last blog, but oh well. Perhaps it's the theme of my life right now.  Because I want to say that at the same time I was sooooooo at peace, and soooooo grateful to be where I am. I would say that if I could draw a picture of how I feel, my emotions would look like a chestnut.  The hard, dark shell is the pain, the white inside the joy.  It's what's at core.  But the shell protects the core, helps it remain untouched and pure......the shell gets the brunt of the elements....it's supposed to be there....This loneliness is good. It is special, if only because I feel it so deeply, although I think it is more than that.  Sorry if I am being cryptic. Tonight I am writing just for myself to understand.
