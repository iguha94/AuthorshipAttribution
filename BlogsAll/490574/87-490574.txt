         Today is my last full day in Playa Samara.  What an experience.  It's been amazing. Things that I will miss:  - waking up to the sound of roosters and a blue sky - passing by the pretty horse pasture on the way to school, the ocean sparkling in the distance behind it - all the people i 've met here, sunbathing with them on the beach, hanging out with them in the bars at night, getting past superficial layers and having meaningful conversations  - walking home along the beach at dusk - the sound of costa rican spanish - mi familia tica, especially playing with my little sister here - the brilliant stars at night - swimming in the ocean everyday -  batidos , blended drinks made of fresh local fruit in water or milk -  gallo pinto , a traditional costa rican breakfast dish that i've eaten nearly every morning for the past four weeks - the feeling of wonder every time i realize that my spanish has indeed improved  - my cute little bug-infested room - the plastic rocking chairs on our porch, in which i like to sit in the cool of morning or at twilight - taking cold showers at the end of a dusty, hot day, and feeling unbelievably fresh  - talking to scott over a broken connection and feeling overwhelming grateful that i can even hear his voice, because it's affirmation that he exists.
