         woohoo! A 1000 word limit, and my essay is now EXACTLY at 1000 words! VICTORY! muahahahahahahahahahahaha  AGH! I am obsessed with my personal statement.  I can't stop fiddling with it.  I work on it before school, in between classes, after school, and I think about it constantly.  I have to STOP.  This is what I am turning in for the first app, which is due on December 1st.  This is it! No more fiddling.   Hehe, unless of course you write me a shout-out telling me that I should change something.^^    Honestly, I think that all I am looking for right now is affirmation though.  My friends have beat up my statement so much (constructively of course), and I've read it so many times now, that it's beginning to seem monumentally mediocre and boring!  Please tell me it's not.  Please tell me that I am going to get into grad school! :(  I know, I know, it's all in the Lord's hands.  IT'S ALL IN THE LORD'S HANDS.     __________________________________ I was an avid reader of my older sisters bookshelf throughout my youth.  By high school, I was reading Fyodor Dostoyevskys  Crime and Punishment , Leo Tolstoys  Anna Karenina , Ayn Rands  The Fountainhead , and the  Holy Bible  for leisure, outside of any school curriculum.  Through such books, I began thinking about the intricate relationships between literature, religion, politics, social mores, and philosophy.  What has always intrigued me about the written word is its power to ignite the imagination, and to allow the mind to experience phenomena beyond the corporeal limitations of its physical surroundings.  The process epitomizes the phenomenon of the connective human experience.    At Stanford University, this fascination with the human experience led me to major in Human Biology, an interdisciplinary field that integrates the sciences and social sciences concerning humans.  For the first three years of my undergraduate education, I studied subjects ranging from biology to psychology to sociology to ethics, with a concentration in anthropology.  These disciplines allowed me to explore a broad intellectual landscape spanning sundry modes of critical thought.  However, after three years of detached objectivity, I longed to explore the face-to-face encounter with human truth that I experienced in reading while growing up, and so began my first academic steps into the realm of literature.    I chose to study English Literature exclusively during my last year at Stanford.  While this complete about-face was one of the greatest intellectual challenges I had ever confronted, it was the best academic decision I had ever made.  Though I enjoyed and learned much in my Human Biology classes, I relished and thrived in the 11 English classes I completed in my senior year and its adjoining summers. Never had I excelled so much; never had I felt so passionate about my studies.  My intellectual journey came to full fruition as I moved from studying human biology, to studying human intra-action (e.g. psychology) and interaction (e.g. sociology, anthropology, etc.), to studying the creative powers of human thought in literature.         Through my teaching experiences at Menlo School in California and Handong Global University in South Korea, I have discovered that teaching is the place where my intellectual passion and my love of human interaction merge in a most invigorating way.  At Handong, my favorite course is  English Reading and Discussion , in which students read literary pieces by essayists and short story writers like Farley Mowat and Edgar Allen Poe.  This course has been the perfect grounds for formulating my personal thoughts on literature and culture, as well as for honing teaching skills specific to the comparative literature classroom.  My students are reading literary works in another languageexactly what I will be doing in graduate school.  Moreover, as their teacher, I have been developing pedagogical methods that focus on how cultures can encounter one another in the classroom, with literature as the vehicle.  When exploring graduate school options, it became clear that studying Comparative Literature would be the organic outcome of my experiences.  The idea that the written word can alter individual lives, affect ones identity, and perhaps even shape national consciousness is fascinating to me.  However, studying only one national literature would offer too narrow a perspective on such themes.  Studying several national literatures would give me more freedom to explore interdisciplinary angles.   My current interests for graduate study focus on Korean poetry in relation to the representation of nature in British Romanticism and Latin-American modern poetry.  The ancient Korean philosopher, Po-U, taught that nature is an extension of the soul, while Yi-Ih taught that the reason for reading is to put into practice what one had learned.  I am interested in looking at the combination of these ideas as a possible framework for the poetry that would deal with the horrors and sorrows of imperialism, war, and national division centuries later.  Like Romanticism, Korean poetry about nature often suggests a radical political subtext.  Chon Sang-Byung, for example, depicts a landscape that seems to transcend history, producing an effect that liberates historys destructive aspect into an imaginative sense of future.      In addition, the Korean we ubiquitously woven throughout the poetry seems to encapsulate the collective memory of a cruel historical reality and provides a rich perspective that I would like to investigate.  Starting with the Japanese occupation, in which the Korean language was anathema to Japanese imperialism, the very act of writing in the Korean language became an act of defiance and expression of hope.  Many patriots expressed themselves in literary creation.  The trends of this literature have yet to be analyzed sufficiently to link its spirit with the spirit of social and political movements.  Ko-Uns poetry has a wealth of riches to uncover along the themes of political resistance and collective memory.    It would be fascinating to look at such Korean themes alongside Latin-American poetry.  Latin-American consciousness also has been deeply affected by the cruelty of a colonial history.  In Pablo Nerudas  The Heights of Machu Picchu  ( Las Alturas de Machu Picchu ), the poets self-identification with a past people, the Incas, demands the finding of a historically resonant and indestructible place.  Indeed, Nerudas  Canto General , the larger work encompassing  The Heights of Machu Picchu , begins by conflating human history and natural landscape. Such imagery suggests that culture lives on as nature, an idea resonant with the ancient Korean idea of nature as an extension of the soul.  My professional aspirations include becoming an inspiring teacher of literature at the university level, publishing as a thoughtful and compelling literary critic, and disseminating the long-neglected literature of Korea as an innovative and culturally astute translator.  With all that is happening in current events, the country of Korea is squarely on the world map.  A page is turning in history, and the global community needs more than ever an understanding between the East and the West.  As a bicultural Korean-American, I am cognizant that east meets west within me.  My knowledge of Korean, Spanish, French, and Latin only enhances the unique perspective that I can offer to academia.
