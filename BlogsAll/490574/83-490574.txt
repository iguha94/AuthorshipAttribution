         I didn't know that Mark Wang read my page, until I got that shout-out from him a couple entries back. Hi Mark. :)  Anyway, I went to his page, and was struck by the entry:   "US immigration-- With friends like these, who needs enemies?"    My response to him, which I thought was too long to post on his comments page: _______________________________________________  Oh my gosh Mark! The same thing happened to me, just a few weeks ago when I came in from Korea! Can you imagine the culture shock? In Korea, they always assume that I am Korean unless I open my mouth and speak, or I tell them that I am American.  And then I come "home,"  where they assume I am some foreigner trying to get into the States with a fake passport.  I got the barrage of rude questions at the immigration checkpoint, too, but the lady even went so far as to take me over to the Immigration and Naturalization Services Desk for further "investigation." gr.   She went behind the counter, whispering to her superior, all of which I could plainly hear.  "Her passport looks two-toned to me, I've never seen anything like it. . . she  seems  to speak English fluently but . . . she says she's from Pasadena . . . etc."  After five minutes of this, I got so angry that I got up out of the designated seat to which I had been relegated, and stomped up to a pair of surprised faces at the counter.  "I can hear everything you are saying, and I think that this is ridiculous!  I was BORN HERE, do you understand??? I have other forms of evidence for you...here's my CA license, my STANFORD ID, my credit cards," one by one throwing the cards emphatically on the counter. "Go ahead, ask me anything.  I don't know what it's going to take to convince you."  They were definitely taken aback by such aggressive behavior coming out of such a "passive"- looking Asian girl who was clearly trying to sneak oh-so-quietly into America.  The male immigration officer coolly asked me a few more idiotic questions (What's the Stanford mascot?  Cardinal . Who's the point guard of the basketball team?  I have NO idea.  What's the nearest freeway to your house?  110.   Who's playing at the Rose Bowl?  I don't KNOW .) and then nodded at his coworker to stamp me in.  "Happy Holidays!" he said cheerily as I left. gr.  I was in such a state of shock for the next hour or two that I couldn't even have a decent conversation with my dad in the car for fear that I'd burst out crying. ____________________________________________________  I can understand that they need to be viligant during Orange Alert, but do they have to demean you and treat you as if you're guilty just because you don't look the part?  Like Mark, I also saw the blatant racial discrimination, whites or other clearly "American"-looking men and women being waved on right through.  What does it mean to look "American"???? For crying out loud! And what happened to "innocent until proven guilty" anyway?  Sure, the immigration checkpoint at the airport is not necessarily the court of law requiring due process, but it's the principle of the thing.  Just treat me like I'm innocent, with respect and civility, UNTIL you've proven that I'm guilty. Geez.    Sorry, got all fired up about that one. But, I did learn a profound lesson from the whole thing: it just made me realize that  I'm a stranger anywhere I go .  Whether I'm in Costa Rica, or Korea, or the U.S., or anywhere, I won't fully fit in...but I think that I like that, because it reminds me of my true citizenship anyway.  For me, being a missionary isn't about just some duty to God, some sacrifice I need to make for Him.  It's about the fact that the whole world is my home and not one localized place.  No one place is more HOME to me than another.   I wrote about this in a previous entry, but I think that it's worth recapitulating here.  Home is people, not a place.  And people are everywhere.  I love people, I love experiencing different cultures, I love traveling, I love learning languages, I love God's world, I love God's plan, I love the gospel...you can see why I couldn't stay here, in one place, my whole life.  I was telling Inna last night that I didn't have to use the word "missionary" to describe who I want to be.  It's just the same to me as living overseas, doing what I love, and faithfully following Christ wherever I am. Ultimately, there's only one place where I BELONG, only one place that I can truly call HOME, and that's in heaven with God Himself.  So even now, while I live this life, I just want to be with HIM, following HIM, because that's the closest thing to home there is.
