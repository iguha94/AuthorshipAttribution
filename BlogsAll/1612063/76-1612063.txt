JUST BACK FROM AUSTIN   Alright, so i just got back from Texas. It was loads of drunken fun and loud music and bbq and little boys. Thanks to the readers of this blog who came up to say hi to me. it was so fucking awesome meeting you all.   Franz Ferdinand  put on the best show i've seen in about 5 years, if not ever. My memory is such crap, but i've never felt so much joy as when I danced to "Take Me Out" while the floor below my feet bounced and two people stage dove. The chemistry between Alex and Nick is unbelievable -- totally homoerotic and sexy, you could cut it with a knife. Mind you, they played the first night i was at SXSW, so they managed to raise the bar really fucking high for everyone else. Oh, and they played "The Dark of the Matinee" aka "Hava Neglia", which was extra fucking special.   The Hives  were absolutely amazing at the SPIN party, as were the Killers, the Von Bondies and the Bronx. It was one of the Hives' first american shows in a long time and the crowd was totally mental. I think i'd enjoy the hives even if i watched them on mute since Pelle is such a great frontman.  The Vice party was pretty fucking special as well. Set at some house just outside of the center of all the sxsw activity, death from above, the fever, and the stills played the backyard as cute people walked around everywhere drinking pabst and dancing inside the house to a great dj. it was like a high school party that you might see in a john hughes movie. thinking about it makes me want to cry.
