Thank you   Megadork  for posting   The Game of Mash  on your blog. So many hours in high school were spent playing this game. Most notably back stage during the Spring Musical and the Fall Play when I was doing tech crew and trying to figure out ways to entertain everyone.   Anyway, i did mash twice with two different numbers cause I couldnt decide if I liked the number nine more then three.   Here are my results:   Using the number  3  as my favorite number:  You will live in  Apartment . You will drive a  red hummer . You will marry  Ben  and have  5  kids. You will be a  dj  in  paris .  (I know about 40 Bens, so really, this could be anyone and they're all cute.)    Using the number  9  as my favorite number:  You will live in  Shack . You will drive a  pink subway . You will marry    Brian Montouri   and have  1  kids. You will be a  A&R  in  Paris .  (I was a bit more specific about which Brian. Coincedently, this Brian just stopped by my office to give me a drawing he made me of Neil Diamond ... he used his own pubic hair for Neil's chest hair. so sexy).   Please post your results in the comment box.
