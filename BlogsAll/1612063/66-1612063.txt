HOLY FUCKING AWESOMENESS EXPLODED   The Aquariuspotting birthday party was the fucking shit. Best party ever. Thanks everyone for helping make it so awesome. So much going on. Nobody got hurt. Nothing went bad. Everyone smiled and sang their little hearts out. I love people so fucking much. Details forthcoming, but until then,   Nick 's got photos on his site and a round up.  Oh, BIG THANKS goes to:   Brian Battjer  for allowing all of us crazy kids to have a party at his loft and for not freaking out when the place held more people then i would've imagined who were all drunk and having fun and also for not freaking out that Pablo Escobar's wet dream exploded in his bedroom. Also, because Brian is easily the nicest human you'll ever meet in your entire life... no matter how long you live and where you live. Also, thank you for being the object of desire for all my girlfriends who were swooooooooooning by the end of the night over you.  Victoria, Brian's roommate for being awesome and letting us have a party at her home.    stellastarr*  for SAVING THE MOTHERFUCKING DAY by letting us borrow their PA amp and speakers. Holyshit, that would've been one whack party otherwise. Not to mention, the band came throught on the 11th fucking hour when i called an hour before the party and said "OH MY GOD I NEED YOUR HELP!" That's fucking friendship.    Laura  and   Dan  for sharing a party with me despite my retardation.  Everyone, for coming.
