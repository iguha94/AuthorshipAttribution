AWWWWW!   I know that it might be really super uncool of me to totally fucking love Gwen and Chris Martin, but I think they make an adorable couple and their baby, Apple, is gonna grow up to be a totally upstanding knockout. Throughout her pregnancy, Gwen looked picturesque and Chris was a total doting husband/father-to-be. What isn't there to admire about that? Also, Chris is just a really nice guy. He's like the type of guy you're happy to have around, but don't necessarily make plans with because you think he's doing something way more fun and would think that what you're doing is so lame, but it's actually just all in your head and he really wishes you'd call him every once in a while to make plans to go to the park or something. Gwen is sort of that pretty girl who is friends of a friend and you remember every conversation you've ever had with her and what she was wearing at the time.  I'm home sick today and have been watching loads of TV and finding out some interesting things:  One of the twins from Sweet Valley High is totally on a teeth whitening commerical.    They played a Grandaddy song on the Today Show this morning.   Honda is using a Ween song from  The Mullusk  (sp?) album and nobody's said anything? I've been like dancing around my room whenever it's on, and i refuse to believe that nobody else noticed it.   To those who felt like everyone knew about the beheadding of Berg and didn't think I needed to bring it up in  my  blog, i'd like to point out that there are people in Germany that don't know that they need to   have sex  in order to have babies.    that's all.
