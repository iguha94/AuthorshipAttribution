Oh, no, here we go again....  The promoters of sexual perversion are    trying to co-opt Tolkien .    Mr. Shea   and    Mr. Lams   have good comments to make on this. I was disappointed, but not surprised, that the actors 'played along'. Par for the course in today's Hollywood. It's from a secular perspective, but the classic article on the topic is    And in the Closet Bind Them  by Quickbeam over at   TheOneRing.Net .  Sad though it is that people have this bizarre need to give fictional characters sexual twistedness, it's only to be expected. After all, the same types do this with historical people who are safely dead and unable to defend themselves. ( I once thumbed though a library book in which the clueless author speculated that  St. Philip Neri  was 'gay'. After all, he had a lot of young, male followers. They couldn't really have been drawn to his holiness- it must have been a secret homosexual clique.I've never defaced a library book, but in this case I was severely tempted ! )  I do have great respect for those who deal with having those particular temptations and overcome them by the grace of God. It must be a terrible cross to bear, particularly in this insane society, and particularly now that there are even those who claim to represent the Church who urge those so tempted to give in. But I'm afraid it's difficult to have much respect for those who drag reputations into the mud without a shred of solid evidence.
