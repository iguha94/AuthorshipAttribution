Christmas Music  Advent is here, which means our choir is going to start rehearsing Christmas music soon. One of the choir pieces we almost always sing at Christmas, but which nobody with any ear at all could possible tire of, is  O Magnum Mysterium  by Vittoria. There's a link    here , as well as the same link on the left under "Sound files".   However, one of my favorites is this hymn,  which for some reason doesn't seem to be as popular in most parishes, but which we sing every year.    Of the Father’s love begotten, ere the worlds began to be, He is Alpha and Omega, He the source, the ending He, Of the things that are, that have been, And that future years shall see, evermore and evermore!  O that birth forever blessèd, when the virgin, full of grace, By the Holy Ghost conceiving, bore the Savior of our race; And the Babe, the world’s Redeemer, First revealed His sacred face, evermore and evermore!  O ye heights of heaven adore Him; angel hosts, His praises sing; Powers, dominions, bow before Him, and extol our God and King! Let no tongue on earth be silent, Every voice in concert ring, evermore and evermore!  Christ, to Thee with God the Father, and, O Holy Ghost, to Thee, Hymn and chant with high thanksgiving, and unwearied praises be: Honor, glory, and dominion, And eternal victory, evermore and evermore!
