All Souls  I'm not sure that I will be able to blog tommorow, so I will post for All Souls Day now.   The Golden Prison - Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  WEEP not for me, when I am gone,  Nor spend thy faithful breath  In grieving o'er the spot or hour  Of all-enshrouding death;   Nor waste in idle praise thy love  On deeds of head or hand,  Which live within the living Book,  Or else are writ in sand;   But let it be thy best of prayers,  That I may find the grace  To reach the holy house of toll,  The frontier penance-place,—   To reach that golden palace bright,  Where souls elect abide,  Waiting their certain call to Heaven,   With Angels at their side;   Where hate, nor pride, nor fear torments  The transitory guest,  But in the willing agony  He plunges, and is blest.   And as the fainting patriarch gain'd  His needful halt mid-way,  And then refresh'd pursued his path,  Where up the mount it lay,   So pray, that, rescued from the storm  Of heaven's eternal ire,  I may lie down, then rise again,  Safe, and yet saved by fire.       The Dream of Gerontius  , also by the Venerable, is too long to blog here completely. IMHO, it would make fine reading for All Souls Day.
