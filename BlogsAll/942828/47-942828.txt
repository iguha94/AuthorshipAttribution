And in Oratory news....  We are coming up on the two big days, Christmas and the ordination. I stopped by, and Deacon Michael was busy trying to get the programs ready. Everything needs to be pretty much set before he goes on his pre-ordination retreat....  The booklets from    the Catholic Truth Society  have arrived. I picked up the ones on St. Philip, Blessed Joseph Vaz, C.O., and Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O. I am only halfway through the St. Philip one, but it is quite good. It is organized around Venerable Newman's wonderful  Litany of St. Philip . It takes each of St. Philip's 'titles' in the Litany and uses it to comment on his character and life.    Litany of St. Philip  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Christ, hear us.
