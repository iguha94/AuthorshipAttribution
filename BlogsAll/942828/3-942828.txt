My 100 things about me- Fourth 20  61. Most of my ancestors came from Ireland and Wales. One great-grandfather came from Italy. 62. I belong to the local St. David's Society, a group for people of Welsh ethnicity. 63. As far as I know, I'm the only Catholic member. 64. My favorite hymns to sing in Welsh:  Cwm Rhondda  and  Calon Lan  65. Every time I attend a  Gymanfa Ganu  (hymn-singing), I enjoy the singing, but then get a bit sad that Welsh Catholics are such a minority, both in Wales and here. 66. I have medals of Our Lady from two shrines: the Rue de Bac and Walsingham. 67. I wish I could visit the Holy Land but I have no money, and no desire to get shot at or blown up. 68. The first factor prevents me from visiting Rome, either. 69. Ditto for England.  70. I agree with Dr. Janet Smith that Pope Paul VI spoke prophetically in  Humanae Vitae  .  71. One of my favorite movie lines, ever..."It's not going to bed with a man that proves that you love him..It's getting up with him in the morning ! " - Henry Fonda, in  Yours, Mine  and Ours  72. I have a weakness for 'nature shows'. 73.  Part of this may be because when the subjects start acting like animals, at least they have the excuse of actually  being   animals. 74. I like Flannery O' Connor's fiction. 75. Favorite short story: "The Lame Shall Enter First" 76. Runners-up: "Revelation" and  "Parker's Back" 77. However, her letters in  The Habit of Being  make me  uneasy at times. 78. I think every artist or writer, but especially Christian ones, should read "Leaf by Niggle" by J.R.R. Tolkien.  79. It's not a bad idea for average Tolkien fans either. 80. I hope that maybe something I write, or do, will help to give someone a glimpse of the Mountains....
