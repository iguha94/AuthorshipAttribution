Oh, dear....  Tolkien mentions are multiplying in the Blogosphere. For example there's    this post  , and    this one   which actually links to my blog as well. I should be happy about this, and I am. But there is one thing in these two posts which makes me less than thrilled...messed up Tolkienean spelling.  The first says "For you Tolkien fans, this is like worshiping a Valor instead of Illuvatar who created them! "  The group of beings referred to are, collectively, the  Valar , not the Valor. The singular form is "Vala".  The Elven name for God is Ilúvatar, "All-father".   The second commits the granddaddy of all Tolkienean errors....'Tolkein'. This one was a problem for the Professor himself in his lifetime.   "My name is TOLKIEN ( not -kein ). It is a German name (from Saxony), an anglicization of  Tollkiehn , i.e.  tollkühn . But, except as a guide to spelling, this fact is as fallacious as all facts are in the raw. For I am neither 'foolhardy' (ed. the meaning of  tollkühn ) nor German, whatever some remote ancestors may have been. They migrated to England more than 200 years ago...." - J.R.R. Tolkien to his American publisher, 1955 "My surname is now usually misspelt TOLKEIN in spite of all my efforts to correct this-even by my college-, bank-, and lawyer's clerks !" - J.R.R. Tolkien to Graham Tayar, June 5, 1971 (Both quotes are from  The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien  ed. Humphrey Carpenter.)  I know, I'm turning into the Nihil Obstat of Arda here......
