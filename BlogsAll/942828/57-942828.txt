Lots of things connected with this date....  Besides being the traditional (and international) date for Epiphany, today is also feast of    Blessed Andre Bessette.    Also, on this date, in 1982, Fr. William Clancy, C.O., Provost of the Pittsburgh Oratory, went to his reward. Prayers for the repose of his soul would, of course, be appreciated. I never knew him personally, since I did not encounter the Oratory until a good many years after his death, but the affection and respect with which he is remembered by the priests here who did know him speaks a great deal.  One of these priests gave me permission to recount this little anecdote. When he was a novice, (and still an undergraduate in college, I believe)  he went to see a movie... The Exorcist . He was deeply disturbed by the film, and Fr. Clancy noticed that something was troubling him. After he admitted that he had found the depiction of demons terrifying, to the point where he was having a bit of difficulty sleeping, Fr. Clancy gave him some advice, which included this little quote.  "Demons climbing up the side of the Oratory to come get you aren't the problem. If they did come like that, what would happen ? You'd pray- and why on earth would they want to make you do  that  ? The problem is demons climbing up the side of your  heart , tempting to pettiness, jealousy, lack of charity, and so on... That's the everyday Enemy."  Finally, this is also the date of the triennial Election of the Provost and Deputies for the Pittsburgh Oratory. It seems it has been held on this date since Fr. Clancy went to his reward, since the community needed to elect a new Provost upon his death  . Please pray that the Fathers may be guided by the Holy Spirit in this matter.
