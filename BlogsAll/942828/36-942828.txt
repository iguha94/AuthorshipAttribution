Vespers for Friday  Translated by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  Hominis superne Conditor.               WHOM all obey,—  Maker of man! who from Thy height  Badest the dull earth bring to light  All creeping things, and the fierce might             Of beasts of prey;—              And the huge make  Of wild or gentler animal,  Springing from nothing at Thy call,  To serve in their due time, and all             For sinners' sake;              Shield us from ill!  Come it by passion's sudden stress,  Lurk in our mind's habitual dress,  Or through our actions seek to press             Upon our will.              Vouchsafe the prize  Of sacred joy's perpetual mood,  And service-seeking gratitude,  And love to quell each strife or feud,             If it arise.              Grant it, O Lord!  To whom, the Father, Only Son,  And Holy Spirit, Three in One,  In heaven and earth all praise be done,             With one accord.
