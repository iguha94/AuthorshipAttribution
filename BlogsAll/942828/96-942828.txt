Jesus, Conqueror of sin and Satan,                    " Jesus, triumphant over Death, Jesus, the Holy and the Just, Jesus, the Resurrection and the Life, Jesus, the Giver of grace, Jesus, the Judge of the world,  Who didst lay down Thy life for Thy sheep, Who didst rise again the third day, Who didst manifest Thyself to Thy chosen, Visiting Thy blessed Mother, Appearing to Magdalen while she wept, Sending Thy angels to the holy women, Comforting the Eleven, Saying to them, Peace, Breathing on them the Holy Ghost, Confirming the faith of Thomas, Committing Thy flock to Peter, Speaking of the Kingdom of God,  We sinners,  Beseech Thee, hear us,  That we may walk in newness of life,         We beseech Thee, hear us.  That we may advance in the knowledge of Thee,              " That we may grow in grace, That we may ever have the bread of life, That we may persevere unto the end, That we may have confidence before Thee at Thy coming, That we may behold Thy face with joy, That we may be placed at Thy right hand in the judgment, That we may have our lot with the saints,  Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world,  Spare us, O Lord.  Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world,  Graciously hear us, O Lord.   Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world,  Have mercy on us.  Christ, hear us.  Christ, graciously hear us.  Lord, have mercy.  Christ, have mercy.  Lord, have mercy.  Christ is risen, Alleluia.  He is risen indeed, and hath appeared unto Simon, Alleluia.    Let us Pray   O God, who by Thy only begotten Son hast overcome death, and opened on us the way to eternal life, vouchsafe, we beseech Thee, so to confirm us by Thy grace, that we may in all things walk after the manner of those who have been redeemed from their sins, through the same Jesus Christ our Lord .—Amen.
