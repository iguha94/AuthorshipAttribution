Gee...  I post a Tolkien quote on Saturday and it gets quoted on    two      other   blogs, one of which is in Spanish. The Blogosphere is amazing.  I would recommend  The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien   to anyone, of course. Not only do many have information on the Third Age of Middle-earth which is not contained elsewhere, but they reveal a man who had some interesting things to say about other subjects as well, from language to war to the Faith. To me, perhaps the most moving one is a letter he wrote to his son Christopher after the death of his wife Edith.  "I have at last got busy about Mummy's grave... The inscription I should like is :                                                                        EDITH MARY TOLKIEN                                                                               1889-1971                                                                                 Lúthien  ; brief and jejune, except for  Lúthien  , which says more for me than a multitude of words; for she was (and knew she was) my Lúthien." J.R.R. Tolkien to Christopher Tolkien, July 11, 1972.   It was   done  , of course. (The emblems are those of Lúthien and Beren, and were placed there for a special occasion.)
