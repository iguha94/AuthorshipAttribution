Hymn for Vespers- Wednesday   Translated by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   Cœli Deus sanctissime .   O LORD, who, thron'd in the holy height,      Through plains of ether didst diffuse          The dazzling beams of light,              In soft transparent hues;   Who didst, on the fourth day, in heaven      Light the fierce cresset of the sun,          And the meek moon at even,              And stars that wildly run;   That they might mark and arbitrate      'Twixt alternating night and day,          And tend the train sedate              Of months upon their way;   Clear, Lord, the brooding night within,      And clean these hearts for Thy abode,          Unlock the spell of sin,              Crumble its giant load.   Grant it, O Father, Only Son,      And Holy Spirit, God of grace,          To whom all praise be done              In every time and place.
