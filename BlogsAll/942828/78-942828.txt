Litany of Penance   by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.   Lord, have mercy.  Lord, have mercy.  Christ, have mercy.  Christ, have mercy.  Lord, have mercy.  Lord, have mercy.  Christ, hear us.  Christ, graciously hear us.   God the Father of Heaven,                   Have mercy on us.   God the Son, Redeemer of the world,               " God the Holy Ghost,                          Holy Trinity, one God,                        Incarnate Lord, Lover of souls, Saviour of sinners,  Who didst come to seek those that were lost, Who didst fast for them forty days and nights, By Thy tenderness towards Adam when he fell, By Thy faithfulness to Noe in the ark, By Thy remembrance of Lot in the midst of sinners, By Thy mercy on the Israelites in the desert, By Thy forgiveness of David after his confession, By Thy patience with wicked Achab on his humiliation, By Thy restoration of the penitent Manasses, By Thy long suffering towards the Ninevites, when they went in sackcloth and ashes, By Thy blessing on the Maccabees, who fasted before the battle, By Thy choice of John to go before Thee as the preacher of penance, By Thy testimony to the Publican, who hung his head and smote his breast, By Thy welcome given to the returning Prodigal, By Thy gentleness with the woman of Samaria, By Thy condescension towards Zacchæus, persuading him to restitution, By Thy pity upon the woman taken in adultery, By Thy love of Magdalen, who loved much, By Thy converting look, at which Peter wept, By Thy gracious words to the thief upon the cross,  We sinners,                                                                      Beseech Thee, hear us.  That we may judge ourselves, and so escape Thy judgment.           " That we may bring forth worthy fruits of penance, That sin may not reign in our mortal bodies, That we may work out our salvation with fear and trembling, Son of God,  Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world,  Spare us, O Lord.  Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world,  Graciously hear us, O Lord.  Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world,  Have mercy on us.  Christ, hear us.  Christ, graciously hear us.  V. O Lord, hear our prayer.  R.  And let our cry come unto Thee.    Let us Pray   Grant, we beseech Thee, O Lord, to Thy faithful, pardon and peace, that they may be cleansed from all their offences, and also serve Thee with a quiet mind, through Christ our Lord.—Amen.
