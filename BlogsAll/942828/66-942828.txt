Day of Mourning  Thirty years ago, on this date, the members of the Supreme Court of the United States (with several honorable exceptions) legalized the slaughter of children in the womb from conception to birth. (Actually, this license stretches slightly beyond the beginning of separation from the mother. A child may be taken from the womb feet first, with the head remaining inside the mother, his/her skull may be punctured with surgical scissors, and his/her brain may be sucked out, without the law saying anything about such an utter monstrosity.)    This     anniversary    of     horror     is      being      remembered     with      sorrow      all     over      the      Catholic     Blogosphere  ,    and      it     certainly      should     be  .    Our     nation     is      stained      with     innocent     blood .     Kyrie  ,    eleison  .    Upon the Infant Martyrs  by Richard Crashaw (1613-1649)  To see both mingled in one flood, The mothers' milk, the children's blood, Makes me doubt if heaven will gather Roses hence, or lilies rather.    At the Pittsburgh Oratory, besides mourning the loss of the butchered children, we are also mourning with one of our own in his personal loss. Fr. Bryan's father passed away early this morning. Prayers for the repose of his soul and the comfort of his family in their loss would be a great help.
