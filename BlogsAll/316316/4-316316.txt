Today's big news is that I got my assingment for my PRP. PRP stands for Policy Research Project, and it's a year-long project, culiminating in the publication of a book or articles or professional report, on any one of several subjects. Yesterday we had a PRP Expo in which all of the faculty who are leading PRPs told us what their specific projects would be about. Then we turned in preferences and today we got our assingments. I got my first choice.  Have I bit off more than I can chew?  My PRP is called Regulation of Gender II, and the sheet I have in front of me has this to say: "In 2003-04 we hope to have team members author creative policy proposals by developing a series of political analogies that could apply to people who don't perfectly fit the enforced binary gender system. Current policies might be addressed in terms of: treatment of visibile minorities (un)equal opportunities for persons with Disabiltiies protection of human research subjects separation of Church and State Freedom of Expression and Association (1st Amendment)"  Basically, the course is about how to best make policy concerning intersexed individuals when "gender binarism is actively maintained by public politics."  I'm so excited I could just wet myself.  Tomorrow at 8am I register for my other three classes. I am hoping to get into Political Economy, Political Financial Management and Political Administration.   Between this and my job interview on Tuesday (yay!), I feel like I am really doing quite well. Life is good.
