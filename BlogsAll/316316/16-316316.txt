I had the strangest dream last night. I was walking alone down Henderer Road in Elkton. I was just at the mouth of the road. I can see it so clearly, it's like I was really there. As I was coming up the road, a yellow SUV of some kind came up over that little hill. Then, all of a sudden, a person on a motorbike darted out in front of the SUV. The SUV hit him and he flew into the ditch (and oddly I don't think it was the ditch there, I think it was the deeper ditch, like on Mehl Crick, but I'm not sure. Anyways, he stayed on the bike and came up out of the ditch, only to lose balance and fall again. He didn't come back up, so I ran over to see what had happened. He was lying at the bottom of the ditch, across a big rock, as if maybe his back or neck were injured. Then a car full of people who were coming by on Mehl Crick (right by where our paper box is) stopped and jumped out to come help. One of them was a doctor and he sort of took over, asking the  man where it hurt, etc. I said, "does anyone have a cell phone to call an ambulance?" and the doctor-guy snapped at me, "We already did that!" Then some police came, only they weren't in uniform or anything, but I somehow knew they were authorities. They asked the people from the car what had happened and assuming it was the SUV's fault (the SUV had somehow disappeared at this point). I kept trying to break in and tell them I had seen the whole thing and it was not the SUV's fault, this guy on the bike had darted out in front of them and there was nothing they could do. First I couldn't make the words come out of my mouth (as often happens in dreams, symobolizing impotence supposedly...?), but then I could and they were just ignoring me. They kept talking to the people in the car (both men and women, and there were like 10 of them for some reason) and completely brushing me off when I said I had seen it close up and could give a full description.  Now tell me, what the hell does that mean?
