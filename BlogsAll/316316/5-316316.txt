Hrm. Orientation starts tomorrow and I should be excited, but I'm not. I really would rather just stay home, paint some more furniture, etc. Hopefully I will be more into once I get there. I am interested to see what my class schedule is going to look like, what sort of research opportunities there are going to be, etc., but I don't want to get up early and have to be there and all that.  How did I get so fucking lazy in only a couple of weeks?  I'm noticing that I am posting a lot of self-centered blah blah blah and no real substance here. Hopefully that will change with time. I really do have thoughts, I just have gotten way way out of practice at recording them. (And and writing without excessive :) and :( all the time).   On the message boards I post to, someone is being really mean and vile to me. This has happened before and it will happen again, but my skin doesn't seem to be getting any thicker. I always come back to questioning myself, even though I am positive that I'm in the right. I have to cultivate some sense of not caring about things and people that don't matter, but I haven't done it yet.  If you haven't done it yet, subscribe to Bitch. It's a good publication and it needs help.  Yeah, right. Like there is someone reading this.  I need ideas for a really spectacular birthday present for Mark, followed by a really spectacular anniversary present. Anybody got any ideas?   Speaking of anniversaries, it was the one year wedding anniversary of one of my very favorite couples on Earth this past weekend. Just the thought of that makes me giddily happy for a moment. I love people who are in love.
