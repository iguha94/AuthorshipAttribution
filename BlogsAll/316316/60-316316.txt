Do y'all remember the part in   The Goonies  where   Chunk  gets captured by the   Fratellis  and recounts everything bad he's ever done in his whole life?   In third grade, I cheated on my history exam. In fourth grade, I stole my uncle Max's toupee and I glued it on my face when I was Moses in my Hebrew School play. In fifth grade, I knocked my sister Edie down the stairs and I blamed it on the dog... When my mom sent me to the summer camp for fat kids and then they served lunch I got nuts and I pigged out and they kicked me out... But the worst thing I ever done - I mixed a pot of fake puke at home and then I went to this movie theater, hid the puke in my jacket, climbed up to the balcony and then, t-t-then, I made a noise like this: hua-hua-hua-huaaaaaaa - and then I dumped it over the side, all over the people in the audience. And then, this was horrible, all the people started getting sick and throwing up all over each other. I never felt so bad in my entire life.    Remember?  Well that was me last night. When I was trying to sleep. From about 2am until morning. Going over and over every wretched thing I've ever done. And there have been some pretty amazingly awful ones. It was an experience I'd prefer never to repeat.  Where the fuck did it come from, though?
