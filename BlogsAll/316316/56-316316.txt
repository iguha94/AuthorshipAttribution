So I've been curled up on the couch reading the latest edition of Harper's for the past hour or so. Not a bad way to spend a Sunday evening. I'm especially amused by the story about high school journalism that mentions my very own little teeny alma matar, and even refers to a letter written by my own mum.  However...  There is a reason I should not read the left press, or the "left" press, as may be more appropriate. Every article makes me want to change my life, start a campaign, march on the capital, DO SOMETHING, and I just don't have the energy to DO SOMETHING about everything. For instance, in this edition, there was a piece on Bush's Medicare "reform"--I already knew about that, but this piece reminded me what a fucking nightmare it was. Then there was an article about how much energy we use to feed ourselves, from the domestication of grain all the way through high fructose corn syrup and feed lots--terrifying. I knew a lot of it already, too, but that doesn't make the terror any less real. Then there was something else, then something else. So now I'm like afraid to go to bed, afraid to eat anything, knowing that my very existance is killing the planet, that my government is raping the world, etc. and I'm not doing anything about it.  A bit more objectivity and a bit less melodrama would probably be a really excellent idea. That or just no news, ever. And I think a news moritorium would probably be bad for my career.  Today's word of the day was irenic, which means peaceful or concilliatory. I like that a lot.
