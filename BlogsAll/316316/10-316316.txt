I am back at work and I am not really planning on doing much work today. Hopefully I will be able to put together my Powerpoint presentation for PFM next week and maybe do some more HPV research, hang out on The Phoenix, send silly emails, and generally waste time. I do have a few little projects here I'd like to finish up, but nothing too pressing.  My first waking thought this morning (well, other than "Chance, get your butt out of my face!") was "It will be OK. Tomorrow is Saturday." It's getting that bad. When I look at the list of things I have to do between now and Thanksgiving I just shudder. I have no idea how it's all going to get done. I pretty much informed Mark this morning that he's going to be on housework duty for next month. He took the news well, but we'll see what actually happens.  It wouldn't be so bad if I weren't so fucking tired all the time. I managed to not take a nap when I got home last night, but I was in bed by a bit after 11 and fast asleep in like two minutes. To be fair, though, getting up at 7:15 this morning wasn't much of a problem, so I guess maybe I just need 8 hours of sleep. My tiredness at work yesterday may have been boredom as much as actual fatigue.  Anyway, blah blah blah. Told you I didn't have anything interesting to say.  Woo-hoo! Today is allowance day! And I have an extra-large paycheck to deposit! I'm rich!
