Given where my readership seems to come from, it's probably very passive aggressive for me to write about this here. Be that as it may, I'm going to do it anyway, because this is my blog, dammit, and I get to say what I want:  The Phoenix is officially giving me a headache. It's obvious there is no fucking way I can win. "More moderation but let me say whatever the fuck I want!" just doesn't work. I'm doing the best I can to be fair and objective and to read nearly every thread (which is getting tough, by the way, the way the place is growing and with pesky school and the pesky job and all that) and to keep my eye on everythign and make the changes that everyone asks for and please everyone.  Which really comes back to the problem: you can't please all of the people all of the time. I ought to know that by now, but I still INSIST on trying, thinking I am going to find a new way and magically be able to be everybody's best friend.  I don't know when I got so fucking eager to please. For a while there I was thinking it was a good trait, but now I'm not so sure. I don't want to lose what I think and what I feel in my quest for the middle ground. I've NEVER been a fucking moderate--why would I be starting now?  I really love The P, and I really want to see it grow and flourish, but I can't be everything everyone wants. Solutions to that are welcome. :(
