From Les, Em, Dana, Dea and Frog  Here's how this works. Frog had a list of 100 statements that she got from Les, who got it from Em, who got it from Dana, who got it from Dea. The list Frog got had some things bolded--those were statements from Ems list that were also true for Les. Anything that was true from Les' list, Frog bolded.
