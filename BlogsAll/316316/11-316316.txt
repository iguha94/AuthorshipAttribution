Exhale. The big school week is over. Now just two relatively calm days of work, then a weekend. Good stuff. I am definitely in the mode of wanting to play. I'm going to hang out with Susan tonight, which should help considerably. I'm giving myself tonight completely off work. I'll start back up again tomorrow night. Or at least I'll make a new list.  Or maybe I should make a new list tonight. That's not really work.  Budget be damned, I just ordered three tshirts from Northern Sun. One is the old standby "Keep Your Laws Off My Body" (it was on sale for $8), one has a red handprint on black and says "The Death Penalty Makes Killers Of Us All," the final one says "I Read Banned Books" and has a banned books list on it (I've wanted that one forever). Something about living here really makes me want to wear my politics on the outside. I guess that's not a bad thing.   I have to start thinking more about internships. I have to redo my resume. I have to...god, I have so much to do.  The Phoenix is kicking ass, though. 90 active members in less than a week. No complaints from me about that. And people seem to be having actual conversations and everything.  I wonder if anyone aside from Susan and Emily read my blog? If you aren't Susan or Emily and you're reading this, would you let me know? I'm just curious. avengingophelia@yahoo.com
