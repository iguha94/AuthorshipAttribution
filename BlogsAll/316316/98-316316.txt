I am bopping back and forth between message boards this morning, though I really should be doing something a bit more productive with my time (and really, any use of my time, including sleeping or replacing the grout in my shower, would probably be more productive). And the same thought keeps crossing my mind: why are people such  assholes ? There has been some relatively heavy shit in message board land these past few days (someone I didn't know/don't remember having been around apparently killed herself), and people's reactions to it, on multiple sides/multiple boards, are fucking appalling! It's like it's nothing more than today's excuse for attacks.  You know how there is often that one person that you just don't fucking like, even though you try to like them or see the good in them or whatever? Well that person has been on my last nerve for a long damn time now, and I'm just about fed up with the whole thing. I don't like his friends, I don't like his enemies, but most of all I just don't like him. So there. Why is it so hard for me to admit it when I just don't fucking like someone, end of story? It isn't a misunderstanding, we're not in a fight,  you're just an asshole!    This is both a rant and a ramble, so I'm going to sign off now and go try to find something more productive to occupy my time. Perhaps I will do the dishes and the laundry for the man I live with, cuz I'm oppressed like that.   Blah.
