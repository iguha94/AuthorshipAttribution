I'm done with the Warbird, the Ms. boards are becoming a less and less friendly space...I'm thinking maybe it's time to start some boards of my own. Susan says she's interested, so we're going to talk about it tonight (we are going to see Kill Bill). I am trepidatious--what if nobody wants to post on my boards? What if moderating is really hard and puts me in horrible positions all the time? I am not just looking for a place to house my clique, you know? I really want to find a place where women can meet and talk and support and discuss and yeah, even argue, without completely disrespecting each other and treating each other like dogshit. I want a community, the kind that I keep trying to make out of Ms. with damn poor results.  Is it even possible? If I post about this on Ms., how many of the people from there will come over and hang out? Is there a way to make it easy to use/user friendly? I know I can use Ezboards, but I really dislike that format. I'd much rather have something that looks more like Ms. or like the Warbird. Is that expensive? It can't be that expensive, since Rich can apparently afford it. But does it take a ton of technical know-how? I have next to none. I know Susan (and especially Tony) have some...  I don't know why this is so important to me, but it is. I really want this space to exisit, and it has become more and more apparent that's only going to happen if I get off my ass and do something to create it.
