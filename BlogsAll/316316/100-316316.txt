I am an agnostic. Agnostic, according to   dictionary.com , is a noun meaning: 1. a. One who believes that it is impossible to know whether there is a God.      b. One who is skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism.  2. One who is doubtful or noncommittal about something.   I'd say I fit strongly into 1a and 2, and 1b really depends on the day. I used to describe myself as an "I-don't-care-agnostic," or someone who not only doesn't know whether or not there is a God, but doesn't particularly care, either.  But that is so, so far from true.  There are few things in this world I want as badly as I want to believe in God. And I don't just want to believe in some god, I want to believe in one with a religion already set up. I want the ritual, the community. Most of all, though, I want to experience faith. And I really try. I am, and have been for several years now, looking for God.  What I mean by looking for God is this--every time I see or hear of something I find truly amazing, I wonder if that was supposed to be my sign that yes, there really is a higher power, and I was just too stupid to recognize it? But then I second-guess myself, thinking that if I really had an epiphany, there'd be no question about whether or not that was the sign. It's like love, right? If you have to ask yourself whether you are in love or not, then you're not? Something like that.  And so I haven't found God. I've had people try to show God to me, though not in anything but the worst possible ways and never from anyone I actually respect. And I've tried not to look before, too, but now that I am looking, I want to know where the hell God is hiding?  This has the potential to disintegrate into serious rambles, so perhaps I should cut it short. This is a subject I've really been wrestling with lately, so I'll probably come back to it at some point.
