Today on "things overheard while Mark is watching TV in the next room":  "I'm never going in the water. The ocean can suck my ass."  He seems to be watching film of sharks attacking people. His viewing habits are...strange.  I've renewed my love of Ebay. So far, the damage is slight, but I'm having increasing trouble restraining myself. Why is it that whenever I have the least money, I feel the need to spend the most money? It makes no sense.  I wonder if anyone is reading this? I somehow doubt it, yet the idea that someone might be does sort of keep me on my toes with regards to putting periods at the ends of my sentances and making some attempt to spell correctly. Which is good, I think.  We've moved our furniture painting operation out on to the front porch because things dry so much faster outside, so I really should be trying to clean up the sunroom (where we were painting before). Once it is cleaned up and put together, the whole house will be in some semblance of order. Not a bad place to be with less that two weeks' residency, I think.  But I'm blathering on here rather than actually cleaning it up. Funny how that works.  I'm hungry. I'm hungry all the time now. I know it's because I am not eating enough or often enough, yet I do nothing to remedy it. I'm actually in some sick way sort of starting to enjoy the feeling of being hungry. That has to be a bad sign.
