I got my hair cut on Monday, for the first time in months. This time, throwing caution to the wind, I got it cut into an actual "style," rather than just getting the ends trimmed. I now have what I believe is know as "long layers." It looks vaguely like   this .The bottom layer of hair is about two inches longer than the next layer up, and the top layer is probably 1.5 inches longer than that. No bangs, but the sides are shorter than the back. Thankfully, it is all still long enough to go up, so I have that going for me.  The problem with me having a hairstyle is that I don't really know HOW to have a hairstyle. So far I've been putting some straightening lotion stuff in it when it's wet (my first use of "product" in at least five years) and combing it out straight. My idea was that this would keep it from being puffy on the top  layer and frizzy at the ends. Results have been very mixed. It looks a lot better a day or so after being wet (I let it dry naturally and even with the straightening goop it's frizzier than I'd like). So my question is this: is there anything I can do to give it that flatter, day-after washing look every day? I can't just not wash it on most days, because of the whole working out and sweating thing.  Also, I want some color advice. What I have now is pretty basic dark brown with some splotchy leftover highlights. I want to do something funkier, but still look employable. Ideas?
