Ug. I should be very happy about today--all I have is an hour or so meeting at noon, the rest of the day is completely free (well, I have to drop the car off at the repair shop and then walk home, but other than that). But I feel very ugh this morning. I'd like to go back to bed. Showering didn't even make me feel better. Maybe walking Chancey will.   This period thing just fucking sucks. The problem with only having a period every three months is that I forget what a collosal pain in the ass it is and then I am surprised when it comes. It hurts, it's messy, I have a headache, I have cramps, and I just don't feel like myself. Most inconvenient.  I was reading an essay last night about periods and PMS and how they have been pathologized, etc. It was interesting, pointing out that if we lived in different kind of society, women might be able to see their periods as giving them times of enlightenment, creativity, etc. I honestly don't feel any more creative or sensitive or anything, though. I just feel put out. I wish I could make it go away completely, or just hibernate until it's over.  That is probably not a very healthy feminist POV, but there you have it.  As has been the case for awhile, I have an extremely large amount of shit that I really need to get going on, and I'm not doing a goddamn thing. My excuse has been that Mark needs to use the computer all the time until his NSF application is done, but that excuse is going to run out today. I wonder what my next excuse will be? I really just need to buckle down and get to work, but I don't feel like I have it in me right now.  Yuck. This is a depressing morning.
