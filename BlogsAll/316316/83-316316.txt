Some facts: 1. It is four-thirty in the morning. 2. I am awake. 3. I have been awake, more often than not, since I went to sleep, at about midnight. 4. One of my cuticles is bleeding.  I have insomnia. It's unpleasant. The little bit I did sleep was peppered with increasingly strange and violent dreams, however, so I guess this is a bit better than that.   It's bizarre the things you think about when you have insomnia. For instance, I have been fixated for several minutes (hours? I'm not quite sure.) on this book that was on my mom's shelf when I was a kid. She had this weird little section of "self-help" type books up in the top lefthand corner of the big bookshelf in the living room. Titles I remember include the ubiquitous   The Difficult Child . Anyway, this particular book had a blue cover and was called .  I touch the earth, the earth touches me . I never knew what that book was about, thought it had an odd title, and wondered. It just occured to me that I'm an adult now, and I can find out what that book was about--read it, even--if I so desire.   Incidentally, did you know that you can make contributions to presidential campaigns using Amazon.com? That disturbs me, but I'm not quite sure why.   Some more things that have crossed my mind in the last minutes or hours: 1. I don't know what  Les Miserables  is about. I have no idea.  2. There is a line in a song from Hedwig that says, "decorate me with blood, graffiti and spit." I thought it was "blood, graffiti and shit" until I looked up the lyrics. 3. I've somehow lost the links section of my blog and I can't seem to get it back.   I feel the need to remedy #1 and #3 immediately, but I think I'm too brain-dead to try to do so.
