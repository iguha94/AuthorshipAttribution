Signs I have seen in the last 24 hours that I am probably going into a manic cycle: 1. I got my hair cut for the first time in six months 2. I spent $100 at Target on Valentine's Day crap, and I have grand plans of turning it into cute little Valentine's packages to send out to friends and family 3. I'm not cold 4. I had class for 1.5 hours and had to leave twice because I couldn't sit still 5. I talked throughout the entire class, using lots of phrases such as "this pisses me off..." 6. I'm seriously considering taking the dog for a run 7. I dyed my hair once last night and am wondering if I have time to do it again this afternoon 8. I'm not hungry 9. I drove really fast everywhere I went today, even though it is raining 10. I have a craving for very loud music  So here's the thing. I'm not bipolar, at least not that I know of. However, I have very obvious up and downswings, and this is the first time I've gone up in months. I've been tired and lazy and semi-depressed since before Christmas. Is this better? Well, if this is just a bizarre beginning rush and it's going to even out, then it's definitely better. If not, though, it's not. Depression sucks, but at least I don't get into fights and spend money when I'm headed the other direction.  Does this happen to anyone else, or is it just me?
