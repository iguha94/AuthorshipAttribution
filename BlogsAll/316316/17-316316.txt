Why is it that no matter what time I get here on Wednesday, there's never any place to fucking park? I always have to park illegally in the library lot during my first class. Makes me crazy.  Susan and I went to see Ani last night. She was good. I've seen her better, but she was good. Very mellow, just her and her guitar. I think I liked her best with just Andy, or maybe with Andy and Sara Lee. I certainly like her better by herself than with the full horn section and all that crap, but she loses a bit by not having a rthymn section.  Someday, I will learn to spell rythme. Rythmn. Was that right?   Anyway, I think Susan enjoyed the show and I was really  happy she came. I had been worried for days that she wouldn't like it, and with the tickets being so spendy, etc., I was going to feel terrible if she didn't. She did though, so all is well.  I honestly don't understand how anybody could not like Ani, but I'm biased.  I really don't want to be at school today. Wednesday is always like this.  Next semester's class schedule is up, so I'm trying to figure out what to take. There are several interesting sounding seminars. Maybe I should email some professors...I have one extra space in my schedule, so I can take something fun, rather than a core course (because I didn't take AQA last semester). I'll pay for it by having to take PE II and AQA II next year, but whatever. Spread that nasty shit out. :)  I'd like to take something in the women's studies department. I keep thinking about joint degrees...but then I realize that I have already bitten off more than I could possibly chew and really I should just leave well enough alone.  I have a lot to do, school-wise. I should probably be stressed about it, but I'm really not. I am too freaking tired to be stressed right now. I have no idea why, but I'm exhausted.   I think changing my work week so that school and work are seperate (school Mon-Wed, work Thurs-Fri, weekend Sat-Sun) will help. I hope so...
