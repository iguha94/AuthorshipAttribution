In honor of the impending holiday of doom, today's play list includes some of my favorite lost love songs:   My lover's gone,  His boots no longer by my door,  He left at dawn,  And as I slept I felt him go  Returns no more,  I will not watch the ocean,  My lover's gone, No earthly ships will ever bring him home again.   Dido, "My Lover's Gone"   It's been seven hours and fifteen days Since u took your love away I go out every night and sleep all day Since u took your love away Since u been gone I can do whatever I want I can see whoever I choose I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant But nothing I said nothing can take away these blues `Cause nothing compares Nothing compares 2 u  Sinead O'Connor, "Nothing Compares 2 U"   And the years have proved  To offer nothing  Since you moved  You're long gone  But I can't move on  And I miss you-  Like the deserts miss the rain   Everything But The Girl, "Missing"   This borrowed dress --  It doesn't do much for me, but it's doing it's best This stolen purse --  it's got a bad history, but mine is much worse I've been down on my knees drunk While you're out doing standup You're making love to your punchline, baby  When this just ain't my town I'm just another luxury liner going down And I guess we're through Well lucky you  Heather Eatman, "Lucky You"   See the stone set in your eyes See the thorn twist in your side I wait for you  Sleight of hand and twist of fate On a bed of nails she makes me wait And I wait without you  With or without you With or without you  U2, "With or Without You"   And I'm here to remind you Of the mess you left when you went away It's not fair to deny me Of the cross I bear that you gave to me You, you, you oughta know  Alanis Morrisette, "You Oughta Know"   well we put a thousand miles on that beat up forign car whenever weather would permit we'd make love under the stars our happiness completed by being attached and being free we would each take turns being bobby mcgee we were headed for salinis, but we hadn't got there yet some girls you don't remember, some girls you don't forget  Adam Brodsky, "Some Girls"   maybe the moral higher ground ain't as high as it seems  maybe we are both good people  done some bad things i just hope it was okay i know it wasn't perfect i hope in the end we can laugh  and say it was all worth it  Ani DiFranco, "Hour Follows Hour"
