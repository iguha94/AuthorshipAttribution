Those of you who have never lived with me (which, by my count, would be all of you) do not realize this about me: I have a bit of a food obsession problem. I find a food I like and then I want to eat nothing but that, and I eat it gluttonously until I am so sick of it I never want to look at it again. Inevitably, I pick really awful foods. This has happened with both Entemann's coffee cake and Entemann's chocolate covered donuts, for example.  Frozen strawberries (pre-sugared) were another favorite, as were strawberry and lime all-fruit popsicles. In my coffee cake prime, I ate three a week, easily. Between Halloween and Thanksgiving it was frosted sugar cookies from the bakery at H.E.B. I ate five at a time. I'm not even kidding. Two or three ten-count cartons a week. It can get ugly.  Right now, Nocello (so, so so much better Italian version of Nutella) and raw apples is my food obession. Because I am calorie and weight and nutrition concious now, unlike before, I am holding myself to only having my snack (one sliced up raw apple and two tablespoons of Nocello, and yes, I measure it out) once a day. I'm very proud of my restraint. The problem, though, is that my theory about this has always been to let myself have as much as I want, and eventually (usually in two weeks or so) the craving runs out and I don't 'want it anymore. If I only have apples and Nocello once a day, though, is that going to happen? Or I am going to be a maintence apple-and-Nocello-holic, having to have my one apple and Nocello a day to survive?   (Note: After some time passes, my relationship with my previously-obsessee foods seems to even out. For example, I am now able to eat small(ish) quantitites of coffee cake and donuts, or have ONE popsicle, rather than one box of popsicles. I'm not ready to test the sugar cookies yet, though.)
