It's Friday the 13th, the rain has turned to ice, and today's play list has a special meaning to me that I'm not going to share. Just the songs. If you can pick out the common thread, good for you.   'Cause I've got a little one who loves me as much as you need me And, darling, that's loving enough For a hiking boot mother who's seeing the world For the first time with her own little girl.  Holly Near, "Started Out Fine"   One night while I was out a ridin'  The grave yard shift, midnight 'til dawn The moon was bright as a readin' light  For a letter from an old friend back home.  And he asked me  Why do you ride for your money  Tell me why do you rope for short pay You ain't a'gettin' nowhere  And you're loosin' your share  Boy, you must have gone crazy out there.  Jerry Jeff Walker, "Night Rider's Lament"   Daddy Frank played the guitar and the french harp, Sister played the ringing tambourine. Mama couldn't hear our pretty music, She read our lips and helped the family sing. That little band was all a part of living, And our only means of living at the time; And it wasn't like no normal family combo, Cause Daddy Frank the guitar man was blind.  Merle Haggard, "Daddy Frank (The Guitar Man)"   I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the sky Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies Turning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes  Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I’ve been Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend Loving her was easier than anything I’ll ever do again  Kris Kristofferson, "Lovin' Her Was Easier"   It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat And Mama hollered out the back door y'all remember to wipe your feet And then she said I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge   Bobbie Gentry, "Ode To Billy Joe"   But I'll hang around as long as you will let me I never minded standing in the rain You don't have to call me darlin', darlin' But you never even call me by my name  Steve Goodman and John Prine, "You Never Even Call Me By My Name"
