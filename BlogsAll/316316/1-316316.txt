OK, so I suck at this...  Today is a very exciting day in the Mitchell-Harnett household. We just got our dog, Chance. His name was Champ at the rescue, but we figured a small change would be OK. He seems to be doing OK with being here so far, though he's only been here for about an hour. He is already asleep on the office floor while both Mark and I click away at our computers. That can't possibly be a bad sign.   I'm apprehensive about having a dog--the mess, the responsibility, the cost, all that. But it is already making Mark so happy that I'm glad we're doing it, and I think I am going to grow very attached to this dog very quickly as well. He's just so damn likeable. He is a big boy (103 lbs), tall, well proportioned, gorgeous. And he's so mellow and kind, at least so far. Reminds me quite a bit of my stepmother's old dog, Kahn, and that is definitely a good thing.  Other than that, not much going on. We did a lot of home repair type stuff this weekend (finally painted and covered the bench, moved some stuff around, put some pictures up) and I'm very happy with the results. This place has really come together.  And I'm worried about money, of course. I got my financial aid check and it seems to have rapidly disappeared. It didn't disappear, of course--I put some in savings and paid my credit card bill and all that fun stuff, but I'm still apprehensive about how much I have to live on in the next year. I'm sure it will be fine, but I can't help but worry. I really hope the internship at Texans Care for Children works out, but I am very much lacking hope currently.  I am going to apply to whatever private scholarships I can find, though, especially if I am not working. Even a $500 scholarship will make a lot of difference. Someone on the Ms. boards posted a link to a Third Wave Foundation scholarship, so I'll start there.
