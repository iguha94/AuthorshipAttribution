Well, we made a valiant attempt. Here's what we actually accomplished: 1. 18 pages on the PRP paper 2. No studying calc 3. Vague conversations about ordering computer 4. Made lentil soup 5. Played with Chancey in the yard 6. Set up the new printer 7. De-cluttered office and organized shelves, as well as putting up new stuff on the walls 8. Didn't vacuum because we have no bags 9. Didn't get a bird feeder 10. Didn't pick up poop 11. De-cluttered large bedroom table, Mark still hasn't done his nightstand 12. Didn't write any thank you notes  All in all, not terrible.  I'm realizing, as I do periodically, that I am guilty of great financial mismanagement. Surprised? Didn't think you would be. Mark and I are overspending our joint account every month and having to keep it alive with mid-month transfers, and I'm not sticking to my weekly allowance (or even getting my weekly allowance out of the bank). It's all falling apart. Christmas does that, I supposed. Anyway, I need to look at the numbers and develop a new plan, pronto. Now that the holidays are over and I really don't need any new clothes until summer sets in for real, I should be able to decrease my weekly spending. As far as decreasing our joint spending--I'm sort of at a loss as to where that money is going. Well, not totally at a loss--it's going to the grocery store. We have GOT to spend less on groceries. It's fucking ridiculous.  Anyway, that's my project this morning. Figure out the financial crap. Then it's off to work for the afternoon. Yippee.
