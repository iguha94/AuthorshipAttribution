So this is one of those things I should not be admitting in public, because I will probably never live it down:  I am upset about the breakup of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. Well, not upset, exactly, but disappointed. I have been pulling for them through their engagement, their wedding-that-wasn't, etc. I wanted them to get married and be happy.  Why would I care about something like that? Well, that's a good question, and it is one I'm not sure I can answer. I think I just have this romantic notion of both of them being po'-kid-makes-good stories, and I liked the idea of them building something out of that together. Plus there was so much tabloid bullshit about their relationship, I wanted to see them prove everybody wrong and make it work.  Isn't that lame? Neither one of them are celebrities to whom I am particularly drawn. Though I've had a soft spot for Affleck and Matt Damon ever since I found out they wrote  Good Will Hunting  themselves, and their performances in  Dogma  made me even more sympathetic towards them, Damon has always been my favorite. And Lopez mostly annoys me, at least she has since she lost weight (I used to like her just for being a teeny bit bigger than the average Hollywood waif, but anymore she's really not).  Anyway, so they broke up and it makes me sad. And given the nasty presents they give each other (a Bentley, a pink diamond ring) and their bizarre male-female dynamic (he goes out to strip clubs, she learns to cook, WTF?), I should think their break-up is a good thing, but...I don't know. It disappoints me. I wanted a Hollywood fairy tale.  Gah. How humiliating.
