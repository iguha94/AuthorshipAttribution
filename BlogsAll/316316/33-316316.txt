It is a rainy drizzly Sunday morning, which is just perfect. It only compounds my desire to curl up in the papasan and read all day. True, I will have to read economics and stuff for my PD paper, but you can't win 'em all.  I'm in an interesting discussion about school dress codes and uniforms on The Phoenix. I'm not sure where it's going, and I'm not 100% sure I'm right, but it's an issue that deserves some real feminist analysis, I think. The subject of young female sexuality is one that most of us won't touch with a ten-foot pole, and I think that is a failing. It only serves to make young women more confused and stigmatized when we try to protect them in this way.  What else is going on today? We took Chancey for a nice, only slightly drizzly walk a bit ago. Mark is on the phone with Nace now, talking about his stupid NSF application. I will be SO glad when that thing is done.  Strangely, I am really looking forward to Mark being gone for a few days. I'm sure I will miss him like crazy and I will hate taking care of Chancey all by myself, but I really feel like I could use the time alone. Maybe it's just all the academic pressure and shit, but I just feel very compressed right now and like some personal decompression time would be just what the doctor ordered.  I am sad it's Sunday already. Weekends go too fast.   Still haven't heard back from Jenny or Natalie. Man do I ever feel lame.
