Another very mellow day. Read my econ, did some grocery shopping, made enchiladas to eat for lunch this week. All in all, I'm doing quite well with crossing things off my list and not spending any money (well, besides the groceries, but that doesn't really count--that was joint account money and those are sort of necessary). It's a bit after 4 now though, and I am bored and restless. I have more work to do, but I've been so well-disciplined for the last few days, I am losing my drive. Maybe I'll watch one of Tony and Susan's movies or something.   Mark is beginning preparations for dinner. Mustard-crusted pork loin and roasted baby red potatoes with mixed greens, I'm told. My stomach is upset and has been all day, so hopefully by the time dinner rolls around I'll be up for eating it. I think I fucked up the enchiladas by making them with sharp cheddar cheese rather than a mild cheddar/pepper jack mix. Stupid store didn't have any pepper jack. Guess I should have just gotten regular jack. Oh well--they'll be edible anyway, I'm sure.  I should really call a bunch of people, but I don't really feel like talking on the phone. I should also get some work done on that damn scholarship application essay, but my dreams and how I plan to accomplish them (in 500 words or less) is pretty much the very last thing I want to write about right now.  So maybe I'll go watch TV. I intervened in Mark's TV watching this morning, though, so I will feel like a total hypocrite if I turn it on myself (even though I shouldn't, as I barely ever watch it anymore).  Blah. I love the laziness of Sundays...why am I jumping out of my skin?
