Party In a Bottle   Last night was Evermean's last day of work for a few days.  She worked all thru the holidays and was definitely spreading herself way too thin.  Last night we were bored and decided to do nothing else but polish off a big assed bottle of champagne and another big bottle of white wine.  WHY WE DO DAT?  lol  We tried to watch Shrek, but didn't last long cuz both of us were drunk as skunks.  Drunk is an understatement for how we were last night.  LOL.  I haven't been that pissy drunk in a while.  Champagne gives you a different high, unlike hard liquor.  I think it's the bubbles that make you all silly and UNINHIBITED.  Lawd, help us.  Needless to say, it was a blast *snicker snicker* and right now she's passed out on the couch and I'm sitting here trying to deal with this headache I've had all morning.     So I got to thinkin'.  How do different types of liquors affect me?  Let's see:  Tequila - makes me get naked, dance on tables, freak people and not remember shit  Champagne - makes me turn into Tom Jones'.  I will perform for anyone cuz THIS IS THE LAND THAT I LOVE..LOL  Vodka - makes me tell all my business and talk shit Gin - makes me a cheap date..lol Beer - makes me mad...I can never get drunk with beer cuz it makes me full Vodka & Red Bull - Be WARNED!  This shit is crazy!  That definitely makes me party like a wild woman.  That beast can't be tamed  Everclear - OOH!  I've been drinking this stuff since college.  Um...it makes me extra crazy.  I think I'll take anything home awf diss..LOL   Anything brown (Rum, Bourbon, Whisky) - makes me throw up..lol.  I can't stand it. Plus, Vida Verde and I once got nabbed by the cops for being pissy drunk on the FBI Building steps.  That's what Jack Daniels (straight) will do to ya!  Thug Passion (Remy & Alize) - put it this way, I haven't drank it again since the first time..LOL  Wont share the results.  Extra scary.  Ever seen Me, Myself, and Irene?  Then you know!
