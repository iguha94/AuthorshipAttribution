Thank You      I spend a lot of time writing on this site from a funny perspective.  But on a more serious note, I think I'd like to say thanks to a couple of people because it's been on my heart for a while now.  I say thanks you to all police, firemen, doctors, and scientists out here for protecting us everyday.  Even though everyone may not agree or even see eye-to-eye all the time, I still appreciate you choosing this job.  Our military folks, thanks yall!  Oh my goodness!  Thank you thank you thank you for putting up your "dukes" for lil ol' me.  Thanks to all of our youngins in ROTC who still want to serve and thanks to the babies, our militia men between 18-25...wow..thanks!  And a personal thank you to my sweetie, Mrs. Evermean Martini for being a for real cop.  I think every jurisdiction needs an officer like you for all these "fuck the police" types out here (I know, I'm a reformed one) and for all of the crooked/racist/sexist cops to shame themselves.  I know you chose your job unselfishly and you would do anything to help people. I can see that in your work and the way you take care of me....your housewife.  Thank you baby!  Thanks to Mr. Bin Laden and his homeboys for bringing American people closer together and closer to a higher power (whatever you choose to call it).  Lastly, thank you to my parents for raising me with an open mind about religion.  Thanks for helping me appreciate the teachings of Islam, Christianity and Hinduism because that helps me strengthen my personal relationship with The Creator and not descriminate against others.
