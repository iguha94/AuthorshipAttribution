Playing House Gone Bad   My honey and I got the idea to get my neice last night and keep her until this afternoon.  Well the shit just went miserably bad to the point where I think that Evermean and I may wanna reconsider this baby madness.  My neice is two years and 28 days old and one would think the terrible twos were waiting at the gate for her name to be called.  She's a controlling, manipulating, wild baby now and it's not pretty.  First, let me say that she's the friggin' cutest thing you'd ever want to see and her little face just makes you wanna hug her all day.  But her attitude (that was distributed to her once she turned two) is out of control.  She must've gotten papers from the terrible two fairy with instructions on just how to manipulate and control grown folks.     The original plan was that I was supposed to go to work this morning leaving her with Evermean to play with during the day.  How bout I didn't go to work today.  Guess where I am?  Over Evermean's house with my niece in charge.  Drill Sargeant Tayah has taken 35 bux from us (we went grocery shopping for fun foods), deprived us of sleep (she went to sleep at 2am last night), I have horrible back spasms (from picking her up when SHE DIDNT FEEL LIKE WALKING), and knocked Evermean out cold (Evermean is the peacemaker and Tayah doesn't think that's cute).  DAMMIT JIM!  Now I have to stop typing my story because she's standing behind me demanding that I get off the computer and play with her and the doggies.  Gotta run before Sgt. Tayah makes me do pushups!  DRATS!!
