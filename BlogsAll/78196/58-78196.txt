In Love     Yesterday Evermean took me to a pet shop and I, not knowing it was a setup, went in and fell in love with a Shih-Tzu!  Her little face was soooo cute..man.  I couldn't let her go.  So of course Evermean saw my face and asked if I wanted the doggie.  Guess what I said...LOL  So it looks like I'll have a new baby at the ranch (Shayde will love this one).  I have to run things over with Tini first or our doggie will be living with Evermean.  I looked at about 4-5 pups until I saw this one that was soooooooo adorable.  We played for about 30 minutes and the attendant had to snatch her out of my arms and threaten my life.  "Back away from the dog, big girl!"  The only thing is, I may have a problem having a female dog because I can't stand the "heat"..ICK!!  So I think we'll contact the breeder and settle for a male.  Shih-Tzu's are so much cuter as girls because then you can dress 'em up and fix their hair.  Imagine doing that to a male dog..LOL  He'd be bitter, no doubt.  If we do get a male, I wanna name him Chance.  I think that's way cute.  If we get a girl (after weeks of weighing pros and cons), I have no friggin idea what to name her.  Tess sounds nice.  I really don't know yet though.  Me with a dog...LOL.  Call the law.  If we get a girl, that'll mean I'll have 1 bitch and 1 pussy at my house...NOW THAT'S A PARTY!
