I am so hungry I could eat my own tongue.  I swear, slap some bar-b-que sauce on it and take it on down.  Maaaaan it's a shame to be broke AND hungry.  That's me!  My stomach is growling so bad right now.  I'm on my way home but I swear I wont make it if I don't get me a bite to eat.  I don't think I can handle going 30 more minutes with no food!  It wouldn't be so bad if I even had a stick of gum, but I don't.  This cherry coke is looking back at me so sadly.  I think he feels sorry for my big ass.  Would I survive if I knawed the label off of this bottle?  Maybe I'll ask someone for a stick of gum (suga!!!!).  The security guard (bless his heart) has the moonies for me so maybe I'll arch my back and beg!  "um..can a git 5 dollas so I can holla at Wendy before I go home?  Can you give me some money for Subway?  Not THE SUBWAY, but Subway, Jarrod's place!!!".  I think that would work.  Maybe I can give him a fake URL and tell him I've got naked pictures of myself online, me and my chick friends.  Nah, I wont be able to face him on Monday.  Maybe I'll pawn my gators!  LOL!  I do have on gators today.  Mules.  If I pawn my gators for a Subway sammich, fuck Jarrod!  I'mma be the next upcoming star on the commercials...LOL  I'm going home now.  I'mma take my growling stomach and my pasty tongue and march!  Me and my gators...
