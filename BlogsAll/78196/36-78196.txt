Post Thanksgiving Meltdown   Well goose and turkey day was a little interesting.  First of all, my mac and cheese was the bomb but it didn't matter because once I finally got to our dinner location (my brother's house), there was another huge pan of what?  BAKED MACARONI AND CHEESE.  So off the break, I had a 'tude.  You mean to tell me, I slaved over an oven I had to wait for only to find that someone upstaged me on Thanksgiving?!!  That's painful.  So what did I do?  What any other deranged, freak-out would...I made an announcement that MY mac and cheese had arrived and there was plenty to go around.  Yes!  Right in the middle of dinner (cuz yall know I showed up late) I belted it out.  Evermean accompanied me to dinner and she met my extended family members she hadn't yet.  Though my immediate family knows our M.O., my extended family has not one clue that I, Ms. Nona like da wimmens...lol  So of course, Evermean with her bubbling personality and magnetic vibe wins over the ONE PERSON I never thought would break, MY GRANDMOTHER.  While I'm afraid to leave Evermean alone for my family to dissect, she's over there kicking the Willie BoBo with grandma!  My grandmother likes NO ONE!  She's like worse than the Weakest Link lady, very direct and very cut-throat.  But ol' Officer Evermean was over there kee kee'ing with grandma like they were old friends so I'm thinking that's a setup.  Grandma is gonna zero in for the KILL sooner or later.  UM...DIDN'T HAPPEN.  Once Evermean got finished with her, she had everything from her kindness to her Christmas list and I was stunned, trust me.  So yeh, after breaking a world record with my grandmother, Evermean had a nice time with my disfunctional-on-holidays-and-sometimes-other-days family.
