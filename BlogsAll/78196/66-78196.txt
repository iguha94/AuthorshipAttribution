Black National Anthem   Marvin Gaye was the MAN!!!  His song, "Got To Give It Up" should be the new Black national anthem.  You know the one, it starts off "I used to know how to paaaaaaaaaaaaaartay!".  I don't care what Black folks are doing when this song comes on. It will make you stop what cha doin', swallow what cha chewin man, I'm tellin' ya.  I bet at least 80% of Black folks (my family included) will dropped plates, push kids aside, and even forget about grandma to dance to this song. You wanna see folks cut a rug?!!!  Put that song on and see what happens in your household...lol.   I propose this should be our new anthem.  No one really remembers or even listens to the real anthem anyway.  I couldn't remember the words if my life depended on it..LOL.  That's so sad, really it is...BUT WHO GIVES A FUCK!     I remember back when I was short, my family would have a party or cookout, whatever and they'd put Marvin's song on (back then he was on wax) and it was all over.  Ray-Bud and Hubert Earl could be fighting over money.  Aunt Shirley and Cousin Sandra could be arguing over the last game of Pitty Pat.  It doesn't matter when Marvin comes on.  They will jump up and snap their backs out, me included.  I live for that song doe.  Fuck Frankie Beverly's Before I Let Go (him let go 'long time ago), to hell with the Cha Cha Slide (ghetto assed shit), and the dayum Electric Slide (If I ever run into Marcia Griffiths imma wet her ass up for dat), Marvin got dat yall.  Just my $.02...sorry...lol
