Chunky Butt   I knew there was an underlying message.  Will explain later.  I go to the grocery store when it all started.  The golden arches were staring right at me.  I saw them cuz I had on my glasses (they never fail me).  I figured I'd go to buy groceries instead of eating junk food.  Hmph.  4 cans of tuna, a box of oatmeal and some friggin Pringles, that's what my spendthrifty ass bought at the grocery store.  How's that for nutrition?  McDonald's had me by the throat and I ain't see 'em comin'!  I tried so hard to resist the urge for that crap, but I could hold on no more.  I'VE GOT TO GET TO DA REGISTA!  I've gotta get outta here fast!   As I'm approaching the double glass doors of a fat woman's dream, I notice something.  No men have hollered at me today.  It's gotta be my glasses!  Gotta be!  Construction men, painters, UPS men, garbage men were all around and no one noticed me!   That never happens!  Men dont make passes at big girls in glasses (and holey sweatpants and a trenchcoat).  I'm losing it!  My flavor, my suaveness, my THANG!  Lawd jeezus!  Not even my Salvadorian papis.  THEY WILL HOLLA AT ANYTHING!  Not Nona..  fuck!     Back at Ronald's pad, I order my usual Value Meal while I'm standing there in disgust.  What's up with homeless people and senior citizens and McDonald's?  Do they have a VIP card that we don't know about?  I don't know but they freak me out.     This morning I go on my tracker account to see what types of searches people do to get my blog listed at the top of their results list.  Some fool put in  chunky butt  and Endless Calamity came up first! LMAO.  I knew it!  A message to millions!  Nona needs to lose weight.  I gotta put one of my chins up for adoption.  Any takers?
