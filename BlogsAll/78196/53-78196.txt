Today's Dedication    Today belongs to Wile E. Coyote yall!  Why? One, because he's always getting fucked up (that would be me) and two, he keeps coming back for more.   The Coyote is always more humiliated than harmed by his failures.   Ain't dat the truth!  Last night was bad.  Too much...TOO MUCH!  Put it to ya this way, after shopping at the mall, getting deluxe security (I'll explain later), and then passing out at around 2 am, I think I need to take a minute. I woke up this morning at 9:40 am (i should've been at work), with my head faced down on the pilla awf da, "Where I'm iz!?"  So now here at work, I feel awful.  Thanks to a half o' box of Crunch Berries, I got stomach prollems.  Thanks to the consumption last night, I gots me a headache.  To top that off, I've got 4 kids tonight (all my nephews and neice).  What was I thinking yall?  Why did I volunteer to play "auntie" tonight?     When I first started thinking about who I was gonna dedicate today to, I figured it had to be someone who never wins.  Wile E. was the first on my mind.  He definitely needs to find a new job, considering his   background .  Gih'd up for Wile E.  I guess just like him, I'll be able to survive this weekend.  Just like they say, if you can look up...you can GIT UP..dammit.
