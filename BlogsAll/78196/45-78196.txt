Today's Dedication       I'm going to dedicate today to Smurfette cuz a bitch it BLUE mkay?  Not only did I wake up on the evil side of the bed, I had a headache, another braid fell out, and I ain't seen my woman in days.  I'm so blue, I wouldn't even crack a smile if it was my turn to "jump in" playing double-dutch.  I bet you Bernie Mac couldn't even lift my spirits right now.  Janet Jackson could rub her butt on my forehead and bring Busta Rhymes with her and I'd still feel fucked up.  I just wanted to slam my head back on the pillow this morning, take my fallen braid and choke the shit out of my cat. His fat ass was the first thing I saw this morning and he had the nerve to give me this whiney meow.  I swear, if I could get away with it and not feel horrible, I would've gone Petey Pablo on his ass and taken him by the tail  like a helicopter.    Today must've been squeeze your big ass in little bus seats day.  Cuz I swear every wide hipped skank wanted to sit down in them li'l seats!  AGGGHH!!  Then I get to work, headache and one-less braid, and one of my techno dwarves wants to debate about who should take our timecards up for signing.  I could've snapped his little neck then.  If my job wasn't like Fort Knox, I would go my fucking self, but niggas need a passcard or a key to get anywhere in this sick assed building.  What's next?  Will I need a keycard for the toilet?  Awf da "you can't flush bigumz cuz you needs a key!"  Thank you Lord that it's Friday cuz I can't last any longer in this miserable place.
