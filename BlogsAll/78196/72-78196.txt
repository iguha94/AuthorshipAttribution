Giving In   Even though I despise Christmas, I decided to go ahead and participate in the shopping frenzy this year.  Two reasons. My neice and nephews are getting older (gifts mean a lot more), and two, Evermean and I had a really good year (excluding past relationship drama) so we decided to exchange gifts.  Lemme tell you, this shit was hard!!  I can't tell yall what I got her b/c she reads this stupid blog and would find out.  I'll put it to you this way, she'll never guess what it is...LOL.  I saw so many things that were extra cute, but too typical during Christmas, so I opted to go a little nuts..lol.  I'd buy this woman the world because she so deserves it.  Everytime Tini and I stopped in a store, I'm like "Yeh!  I'll get her this!  And THIS!!" Thank God Tini was there with me or I'd be selling my ass on the curb (I'd be broke).     The good thing was that Tini and I got to joke around with the store employees (I always do that for a hookup..lol) and that was a hoot.  We met Keisha at Hecht's downtown, who moonlighted as a stripper.  GO KEISHA!!!!  Then we met these cute little French boys and yes...we spent a lot of time in there with them.  OUI OUI!!  And yall know I had to buy something for myself!  I found a Kenneth Cole purse and after the discounts/coupons, I only paid 8 bux!!!  WOW!  Being a shoe and purse whore, that means a lot to me beelee dat!
