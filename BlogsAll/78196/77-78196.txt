I Will Not Conform!!!     Fuck Kwanzaa!!  You read it right, I said it!  Fuck Kwanzaa and the bozo who invented this stupid assed holiday.  For the record, I'm Black...not African-American (not born in Africa so to hell with that label), not colored, not Negro.  Dammit, I'm Black...let's keep it simple folks.  But seriously, why the hell does this so-called holiday even exist?  From what I've read thus far, it was created by (the still living)   Dr. Maulana Karenga  who was also the founder of the Black Power Conferences in the 60's (RED FLAG).  This fool looks like one of those old dudes at the casinos with a pocket full of change, pressed for hot slots and a shot of Remy.  Don't get me started on this bullshit.  Nothing makes me angrier than shit that makes us look extra stupid and pressed.  KEYWORD: KWANZAA!  How come I didn't learn about this shit from my own fucking grandparents huh??  How come my late great grandmother hadn't heard of this dumb fucking holiday?  Because some "scholar" decided he wanted to make up some bullshit cuz he got bored.  Why is it that his bio does not reflect where he was born?  Probably because this assneck was raised in an inner-city and has been pissed all his life.  FUCK HIM AND HIS 7 PRINCIPLES!  Another thing...why must the Kwanzaa symbol look like a minora?  That's original folks (sigh).  Piggyback on someone else's faith....there's a clue!     And God help some of the White people who are trying so very hard to consider our sensitivities regarding culteral issues.  Well listen up!  I refuse to celebrate Kwanzaa.  I wouldn't be caught dead in Kinte cloth because I'm not a fake assed wannabe Afrocentric Black person who loves to wear it to church on Missionary's Day.  Furthermore, call me Black.  Aight?   What sparked this?  My house sister,   Tini has been attacked at her job ...LOL and we ain't gonna stand for this foolishness.  It's just not right dammit.  Friggin' Kwanzza!  WHY I OUGHTTA!!!!!!!!
