Pills 'N Sauce   Last night was the worst.  I can't really describe how I felt. NUMB maybe?  Extra tired and emotionally raped.  So I needed immediate solitude. As if to go inside of a pod and not come out until you were "done".  I felt like I was in a mental   prison  because I cared.  But I didn't like   who I had become .  I hated where my heart was versus where my head was. They just didn't click so I decided to shut down, not reboot, but shut all the way down.  So for dinner I had a   pill  and   chased it.     Not very smart I know, but trust me...I used to live by this behavior so I was cool with passing out.  My nap, unfortunately only lasted like an hour or more because my phone kept ringing.  I can't even pass out properly cuz my dumb ass forgot to turn the ringer off.     Although I do not claim that this behavior is smart or safe, I need a "minute" fast!  If I hadn't, I probably would've had a breakdown something fierce!  I would've gone out like a madwoman so I chose to slumber with a little help.  Some of you may think this is sick, but I don't really give a poot.  I just know that when I wanted to "check out" temporarily, I meant it.  Keyword: temporarily.  For all of you nutball paranoid freaks, I didn't plan on pulling a Marilyn or a Dorothy.  I just wanted to pull my famous Nona.  Got Pills?  Then pass out bitch!!!!!      By the way, I eventually went back to sleep after crying for over an hour, dumping my problems on my roommate (thanks Tini!!!!).  I woke up this morning feeling like the lead chick from Alien when she finally realized she was alive.  But instead I felt like the walking dead.  I don't know what's better...feeling like the walking dead or actually being a suffering live person.  I do know this, I'm glad "checking out" temporarily was an option.  And I can't even express the love and appreciation I have for my roommate.  I love her to death.
