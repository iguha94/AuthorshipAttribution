Cackling Roosters   Boy I could snap somebody's neck!  We always hear the term  cackling hens .  For all you city folk (above the Mason-Dixon Line), that means women who gossip and "kee kee" about other people's business.  But one thing we never hear of is men doing the same shit!  It pisses me off!  Okay now yes..I do have a bit of baggage, unfinished business, whatever the fuck one wants to call it regarding my ex, and the last thing I need is somebody in my shit!  Yes!  I freely share my personal episodes online, but I am very careful how I express myself considering myself and other folks' feelings, identities, etc.     My sister's baby's father (sounds so ghetto, I know) is also my ex's close friend.  So basically he's in my family but a double-crossing gossiping freak!  He asks me questions about how I'm doing throughout this whole getting-over-this-fool process only to go back and tell my ex what I say.  AGGGGHHH.  I could grab him by the throat and slap the piss out of him!  So now this asshole decides that since he isn't getting any information out of me, he'd go to my fucking roommate for info.  What's his deal?  Is it so important to him how this whole "new news" has affected me?  Or does he have a sickening obcession with my shit?!!  At any rate, I hope this punk finds my web log so the next time he wants to know how the fuck I'm doing, he can get his motherfucking read on!  Then he'll have all the answers to his questions.  Besides, my ex has my URL and if his ass wants to fucking know he can do the same.  Both of those bastards can bite my ass and choke off the chunks of my flesh until they fucking gag for dear life.  Fuck 'em both!
