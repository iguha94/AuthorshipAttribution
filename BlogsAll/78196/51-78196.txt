Bright Eyes   I'm still up, wide a fucking wake.  What's wrong with me?  Lots on my mind, I do know that.  Had a long conversation with a best friend today.  Good news.  Way good news.  Thinking about that now.  Interesting... very interesting.   But glad.  I need to stop smoking, I swear.  If I do, I'll be big as a house (already the size of a condo).  That's too risky..(go figure)  I wanna talk about how I survived having 4 kids on Friday, but I'm not inspired.  Christmas bites!  I hate this time of year man.  Christmas lights?  WORSE.  Tell me something.  Why do people waste their precious time putting up lights if they're not going to do them right?  I can't tell you how man extra ghetto displays I saw this weekend.  And wussup with the hanging icicle lights?  I hate them!  Why bother anyway?  Those friggin lighted reindeer make me sick too.    Rain has a way of reminding you how fucked up it is to sleep alone.  That's prolly why I can't sleep.  Plus my bed isn't the same without my comforter (RIP) and I've gotta break this new one in.  I still have to shop tomorrow.  That's gonna suck bigtime because all the freaks and criminals will be out.  Can't think about that right now.  I've finally accepted that my cat is overweight.  I used to think he was big boned..lol, until I compared his body to my leg.  He's bigger than my whole thigh.  THAT'S BIG!!  He's prolly got high blood pressure from being so fat.  Anyway, my back hurts and I have nothing more to talk about.
