       SNOW WHITE SYNDROME  I've realized now that my job is way way wierd.  Even though as a youngster, I've always imagined myself a  TECHIE , but this is , crazy.  Today I took a look around my "teamroom" only to discover that I'm suffering from SNS!  My goodness!  Snow White Syndrome.  See, I'm the only female in this room of 6 people so that would make me a crack-pipe Snow White cuz I only have 5 dwarves.  Let's see, we have the dude next to me on the right,     Sleepy   .  All he does is take short naps all day and the fact that he doesn't care how loud he snores tells me a lot about this job.  During his wake breaks, he reads the news and sells comic books on EBay.     Okay next there's the dude on my right.  He plays friggin Slinko all day...ALL DAY.  If I remember correctly, Slinko is the game on The Price Is Right.  So we'll label him     Dopey    cuz he's a big dope.  Extra tall, bad clothes, and a bad accent, playing project Slinko.  Yeh..definitely Dopey.   Let's move one chair over to Doc.  He's a real pill (no pun intended..lol).  This dude studies 24/7!  Cold Fusion 4.0, English as a Second Language, How to Improve Your Anger, Computer Ethics, Calculus for Dummies, just to name a few.  He's obcessed with learning.  So I figure he'll end up as either a doctor, or just extra smart for no damned reason.  We know plenty of folks like that, walking encyclopedias who are perfect for parties, cuz they seem so smart!  He's a bone head/brain who has a sick book fetish.  I certainly hope he does something productive with all of his new knowledge or he'll end up being the first classified case of deadly TMI.
