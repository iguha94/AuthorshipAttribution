Special Forces  - Big Shoulders, The Saga Continues     Big Shoulders  is on the hunt again.  I think she's trying to take me out.  She can't stand me man and I aint do shit to her.  I tried to be nice the other day and not rag on the fucking mule dress she had on, but nah...she wanna play dirty so I'm gonna let it rip!  This bitch wears flowered dresses all the freaking time!  So I swear she had on a dress that looked like she special ordered it from a botanical catalog. What is her obcesssion with the flora family?  She needs to wear monkey wrenches on that bitch and have duct tape as a belt because she looks like Bookman on steroids.  Plus her shoulder span and   halloween-quality snatch back  are phenomenal.   She has the nerve to send her   "special forces"  after me today.  See, I don't go over there to the coop where   Big Shoulders  manages her team.  Not since I moved over here with my "techno dwarves" and she never comes over here nor do her "hens".  Well the other day, she spotted me (and my new hairdo) outside, basically rolled her eyes and kept on marching.  But she was with a couple of the other extra big, vile women over there.  So today these bitches peeped their heads around the corner JUST TO GRIT on me!  What the hell?!!   Meanwhile, she's   marching around  with her big ass making sure they rate high on the hateration scale.  "Good job piglets!  Off with her head!"  Maybe I should punch her in the belly and that'll solve my ashy hand problem. Saturated fat?  Hmmm.....that should make my paws glisten!  Wait a minute!  CORRECTION: That would be POLY-saturated fat cuz she rocks polyester, knee-length dresses with Peter Pan collars.  She prolly bought them from Dart Drug back in the 70's when they sold clothes.  If   Big Shoulders  keep messin' with me, imma punch her in her blowhole.
