Christmas Update   As promised, here's my Christmas update (as much as I can remember).  This was the first time in about 5 years that I spent Christmas with my immediate family.  I hate Christmas...everything about it, I freakin' hate!  But this time, I decided to NOT GET HAMMERED, NOT BE DEPRESSED, and hang out with the family.  Every Christmas Eve my family exchanges gifts at midnight.  Yes, we did just that.  My neice and nephews made out like fat rats man!  They got at least a thousand dollars worth of gifts from us.  They're little eyes got so big and they were so overwhelmed, they just stood there with blank stares on their faces.  I got the boys a foosball table, Amir got his gifts on Eid (earlier) and Tayah got dolls and nightgowns.  Meanwhile, my sister decided to play the Temptations Christmas tape during the festivities.  I coulda choked the life outta her right there!  I HATE THAT ALBUM!  Hate it!  Especially their rendition of  Silent Night  when that fool starts singing in a high falsetto.  ICK!  Destroy them now!     Tayah and I got into a fight (again) cuz her little pissy attitude is too much for me.  So she and I were beefing cuz I wouldn't let her open up ALL of her doll babies (she got like 6 of them).  My mom and dad got really cute gifts as well.  I got my dad a crystal chess set and also a knife set (he loves weapons..lol) and I got mom PJ's and a crystal cross (she's a little church lady).  My sisters got handbags, cuz they never spend good money on purses.     Other than that, I chilled for Christmas.  Evermean and I exchanged gifts as well and that rocked.  On Christmas Day, I spent half of it with Tini and the other half with Evermean.  Nothing big.  Even though I wasn't depressed, Christmas still sux to me.  I tried hard not to have a negative attitude about things, but it's no big deal to me.  I'm just glad the kids were happy.  That was my main goal.
