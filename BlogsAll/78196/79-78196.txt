Today's Dedication      I dedicate today to the one and only Jimi Hendrix.  I think I was possessed by his spirit this past weekend.  Either that, or I have some sort of sick desire to live like him.  I almost killed myself Friday night and if that wasn't enough, I continued to "party" on Saturday night.  What the hell is wrong with me?  Isn't it bad enough that Marilyn, Dorothy, Janis, and Jimi all have this common denominator?  Am I continuing this trend for this millinneum?      Friday, Tini, Magenta and I go out to a little laid back spot to chill and have drinks.  Tini and Magenta were just fine but NOOOO my dumb ass had to push the envelope and take all I could.  So what happens?  I almost passed out right in front of the bar!  Yes!  That means fall on the floor, pass out.  That means fuck you knees up, pass out.  And....embarrass yourself and all of your friends to the point where security kicks you out, pass out.  That's what almost happened to me.  I started getting tunnel vision, I couldn't see, and my breathing was all fucked up.   So before I hit da flo', I took a walk outside (Magenta had to help me) and then realize that big girl wasn't gon' make it.  So I shuffled my ass 5 blocks home alone only to realize that OH NO!! I don't have my keys.  Do I pass out on my front porch or do I hoof if back to the bar and get Tini's keys? First things first...I had to bring myself down a little so I went out for a YooHoo.  Don't ask me how I paid for it and even how I got back to the bar with Tini but I made it dammit!   I was so glazed over though it wasn't even funny.  The irony of it all is that there is a fire station literally across the street from the bar we were at.  Go figure.   Okay so I survived that and if that wasn't enough, I did it over again on Saturday but this time I wasn't as hammered as the day before.  Either my ass is way too old to party like that or I need to pump my breaks.
