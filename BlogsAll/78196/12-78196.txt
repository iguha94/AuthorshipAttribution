See, I made a vow to try as hard as I could to not talk about people and show love.  But you can't do that with some folks.  Let's take my job for example.  BIG SHOULDERS.  Ring a bell?  For those of you who aren't familiar, I work with a member of "upper management", who in fact really is an overpaid senior secretary/ex-file clerk.  But some bozo had faith in Ms. Shoulders and put the title, MANAGER in front of her name.  WHY?!!  Some folks just don't know how to manage a dayumed thing.  They can't even manage to find a piece of what's left of their miserable personalities and be nice.  So yes, I'm going to talk about her.  And I don't care.    I call her    BIG SHOULDERS   and that's because Ms. Thang has incredibly large shoulders and a wide back.  Not to mention the fact that she's 6 feet tall.  Okay so the buxom-backed bitch has done it again, pissed somebody off, myself included.  Over here in the DC area, we've had a series of scares and evacuations.  So last Friday there was a fire/bomb scare and most folks were told to evacuate the building.  NOOOOOOOOO not    BIG SHOULDERS   and her Amistad (thank God I've moved from that department).  She tells the ladies in her department that they cannot leave cuz they'll be "aight".  What in the HELL is that?  So when asked about it she said, "Give me a minute, I need to make an  executive decision ."  Somebody please help me understand this.  Is it just me?  What kind of decision does she have to make?  "um..i decided that i'm too stupid to realize thousands of people died this week so um...gimme a minute." or how bout, "Yeh ... see I seen this type of shit before on Profiler, they always get the bad guys and innocent folks don't finish dey work if dey run."  Let 'em off the boat BIG ASS.  Free me people dammit!  Okay, I see getting my suga up, so imma bounce for now.  Yall keep it tight.
