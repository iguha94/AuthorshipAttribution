The Savannah Project   It's almost that time again folks.     St. Patrick's Day in Savannah  .  Woo hoo!  For those of you who don't know what I'm speaking of, understand this.  THEY PARTY LIKE MANIACS IN SAVANNAH ON ST. PATRICK'S DAY!  See, Tini had been telling me about the mayhem for so long (she's been going for 9 years), I decided to go with them last March.  Why did I do dat?  I've never ever seen anything like that.  Except for that year I went to Hedonism II (dont ask).  It's a time when you are encouraged to drink,   party , have sex with whomever you please, expose naked body parts or   perform sexual stunts in front of crowds of people for beads ,   drink ,   take pictures with other insane party animals ,   drink , and pass out.  Everyone from the hotel staff to the hot dog vendors, invite you to make a complete fool of yourself.  It's a four-day heathen fest.  Basically, that's what it is.     It's sort of set up like Mardi Gras with the beads, parade, floats and stuff.  But just done up in full St. Patty's Day style.  So I went.  I drank.  I made an ass of myself.  I fell down the steps, drunk.  I   got on the front page of the newspaper .  Part of my crew got into a fist fight (my sister included).  I passed out two nights in a row on the same bench in front of the Savannah Grand Hyatt.  Ya followin' me here?    This town throws down yall !  Tini and I went with about   14 other girls  (all functional drunks) and I'm telling you.  It took me about three days to physically recover from that place.  A place where big country white girls (with black girl butts) can talk swear, throw one back, and back dat thang up at the same time.  Yall dont hear me doe.  A place where little blue haired old white women will do the Electric Slide better than your family reunion's star dancer.  Where people don't see color, they just wanna see which of your   body parts they can kiss  (for beads)..lol.   This place is nuts!  Not to mention the fact that Savannah is a port town.  A  Navy-ships-dock-there-fully-stocked-with-fine-men  port town.  Claude hamercy.     We just booked rooms to go again this year.  So far, we've gotten about 9 brave ones to go along with us..LOL.  There are exactly 67 days left before we head off to Savannah.  Yes lawdy.
