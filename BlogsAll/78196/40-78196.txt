BCD, Benita and B Angie B   First thing's first.  I have a new OCD (obcessive compulsive disorder)!  YES, I have an OCD with BCD.  What's that?  Butt Crack Depth!  Besides being a germophobe, I now have issues with butt crack depth.  I confessed to Tini this past weekend that I cannot orally copulate from behind with a woman who has serious BCD.  I can't!  Not that I have a problem with my current woman (cuz I don't), but I do have a phobia of big but cracks.  I think they're disgusting and quite frightening to be honest.  If my hand makes it past the third knuckle, the bitch gotta leave!  I'm telling you.  I'm way too scared to deep, unpredictable butt cracks.  Sorry, I am.   Another thing Tini and I discussed was that we're looking for a new member for the House of Martini (our house).  We drew up the profile and figured she'd have to be our House Whore.  We have a little bit of everything else in the HOUSE, but not a freak!  So we were thinking of a name and came up with  Benita ....YES...BENITA MARTINI.  How we came up with it?  It's confidential house info...can't share.  At any rate, we're going to interview a few subjects, in search of a new "sister" for HOM.  I think we have a person in mind.  We just have to make our proposal and see if she's willing to be in it for life.  Benita Martini will be like none other.  And I think Persia, Magenta, and Evermean will be pleased with our selection.     And finally, my house wife, Officer Evermean has been working so hard for the past two days.  So I figured I'd wear something sexy and cute for her when she came to visit.  I did wear something skank and definitely giving curbside hoochie, but I WAS HOME DAMMIT.  So Tini teased me all day saying I looked like an oversized   B Angie B  and she chased me around the house singing "I dont wanna lose your love!!!".  I felt violated and definitely underappreciated.  To heck wiff you Tini!!!  I was feeling saucy and cute so don't hate BEEEEYAATCHH!!
