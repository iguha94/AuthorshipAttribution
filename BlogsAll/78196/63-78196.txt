Awwww Shit....   I'm feeling like Glen Frey right now:   The heat is on, on the street Inside your head, on every beat And the beat's so loud, deep inside The pressure's high, just to stay alive 'Cause the heat is on   Remember his song from the 80's? Urry movie used it.  Well I'm proud to announce that we gots heat!  Yessir!  The radiator has a heartbeat once again and a big girl don't have ta freeze no mo'.  Yay!! Now, home alone, I can run bucket nekkid through my house.  My teets wont freeze!  My teets wont freeze!  What should a girl do?  I think I'll rest my toes on top of the heater so they can finally thaw out.  I won't have to figure out where to hide my landlord's body if I kill he!  Yay!  I can sleep in the buff, put grandmas PJ's away, oh! I feel so alive, so high, I could touch the sky cuz I......GOTS HEAT!   Ooh I have a list of things to do in a warm apartment all alone.  I can play hard-to-get with myself and not feel ashamed (yes!).  I dont have to smell old food spewing out of my oven (yes!) I don't have to think of a way to sneak into Tini's bed and cuddle under her duvet (yes!).  Shayde will live!  I wont have to make a parka out of him!  Thank you.
