Death Becomes Her   If anyone knows me well, he/she knows that I'm deathly afraid of spiders.  I can't even look at a movie with them, let alone see one live.  I'm washing clothes so I had to go back downstairs to dry my last load.  As I get to the bottom of the stairs, right before my eyes is a big assed black spider.  Let's say his leg span was about the circumference of a silver dollar.  I FREAKED RIGHT THERE.  Almost busted my dome wide the fuck open because "spidy" wanna chill where I got to go.  Mind you, I'm only wearing socks and the floor is that new-aged matte lanolin type shit.  My choices are, do I buss my head or do I let this little black fucker take my bravery away?  Will I bitch out in front of "spidy" or will I slip, fall, and die right there in a laundry room basement with dirty socks on, some wrinkled sweatpants and a Army shirt (in the heart of gay DC) on a Thursday?  Not the best idea.  So I close my eyes (cuz imma jump over this muhfukka), tense up and jump my big ass as far as I could.  How bout I slip into the laundry room door and just cleared my skull.  My heart was beating out of my chest.  At this point I was proud of my feat, but a sista aint think that she had to make it back (upstairs).  Fuck!  Jump again big girl!  Jump again!  I did.  And slid (but I aint hurt myself that time).  When I turned around, that bastard was right behind me!  Why did I haul ass (two steps at a time) upstairs until I got up to my door, which is two stories up.  I got back inside and figured I had to tell yall.  I almost died playing Jackie Joyner Kirsey in the basement fucking wiff "spidy's" ass.  That's funny yung.
