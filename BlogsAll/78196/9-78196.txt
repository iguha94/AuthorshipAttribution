  There are some fine men in jail!!     I went to see one of my dawgs on lock down after work yesterday.  First of all, I had no idea (up until last week) that she was there.  So during my visit, the girl's visiting area was full, so they had to put me on the men's side.  I'm sitting there for like 20 minutes waiting for my friend to be "processed" and sent thru.  I've never seen so much eye candy in my whole entire life!!  It's a dayum shame how fine the men are in that place.  I'm sitting behind the glass, perched no less...lol, getting an eyeful of the male species.  I couldn't believe my eyes!  Black, White, Hispanic, it didn't matter.  What?  Are they all required to keep fresh hair cuts and tight bodies?  Is there something in the water over there?  Oh my goodness!  I remember thinking, "Now, if it was guaranteed that the men on the streets looked like this and payed as much attention to their appearance, I'd be straight as a board!"  To hell with women (yeh right)..   I'd at least consider it.  So the next time I go visit my friend, I'm gonna make sure I look extra cute.  Maybe set up an email with prison numbers like 700167@yahoo.com.  Then I can yell my number through the glass cuz I'm sure they can easily remember numbers..lol  That way I can get emails from some of these fine as muhfukkas..LOL
