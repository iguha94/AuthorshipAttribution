Why can't I ever get up earlier than 8:00 am?  Is something wrong with me?  Everyone else in this country gets up before that time, I'm sure with no problem.  Am I disfunctional or challenged or maybe I didn't pay attention in get-your-ass-up-for-work class.  I don't know, but it really seems strange.  If I ever get lucky and rise before let's say 7:30,  I always feel like I'm part of some foreign country.  People running about, trains packed, coffee shops are out of control.  But when I get up at 8:30 and leave home at 9:30, it feels so much better.  The world is much more comfortable at that point.  You've got your no-line coffee shops, the train is all yours, and practically NO PEOPLE.  Just housewives, students, and dog-walkers (you may run across a couple of the "I'm too spoiled to work" types) but still....I think it's fabulous.   The morning where I can hold back from busting someone across the skull for being rude.  I don't have to walk defensively at intersections.  And I don't have to stand behind some lawyer or intern who got an A in latte 101.  NO!  It's just me!   My job is pretty laid back and that's why I can come to work so late.  I swear this is spoiling me.  I'll probably end up in second-shift hell after this gig is over.  Yeh...the 11am-7pm crew.  Folks who can't take responsibitly and are okay with getting up late and coming home late.  Hell, quitting time is just before prime time so it's all gravy.  Imagine it..people would be hating on me cuz my job is cool and I don't have to be at the water cooler by 8:30.  Hmph.  Nice thought, but probably will never happen.
