Fetishism   I think I found my fetish..lol!  Okay first, Big Reds and I went to   this  a couple of months ago.  We saw some crazy shit, lemme tell ya, but I got to thinking....what's my true fetish if I had to choose one?  I finally figured it out last night.  I like having sex in places I aint got no business!  That's it!  Now I admit,   Asian girls & old men (LMAO) , constuction workers, firemen, policewomen, yes...I'd say those are just mere fantasies.  But my TRUE FETISH, I think is not necessarily sex in public places, but sex in places where I know I'm just WRONG.  That goes for Officer Evermean too (sorry honey)..lol    Considering our history, it didn't take long to figure out that we git off on this shit.  It all started back in Georgia where we got freaky in the bar bathroom.  Since then we've gotten freaky in other places like the really nice restroom   here , while a bunch of lil old ladies were teasin their wigs in the mirror, at a wedding reception   bridesmaid suite , and of course most recently IN THE MIDDLE OF TINI'S BDAY PARTY, while Tini banged on the door and Evermean yelling, "Five more minutes man!  five more minutes, go away!"..lol  Sorry Tini!  So now I'm wondering where's the next place we'll do it..lol.
