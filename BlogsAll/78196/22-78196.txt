Take it To Da Hood   Okay so last night I go visit my parents and sisters to catch up on a few things and help make plans for my neice's 2nd birthday party and I couldn't believe some of the shit I witnessed...lol.  On my way there, I had to take Metro to a station that I don't fancy too much.  First of all, ghetto ain't the word mkay?  You have anything from pipeheads selling their wares to school kids as young as 7, with pagers and smoking ciggarettes.  I'm like "Don't the adults see these chirren?"  Obviously they don't give a rat's ass.  I begin to think, is it just me?  Am I just a stuck up, old fashioned, prissy bitch?   I think not!     So I'm waiting for my mom to scoop me from the station and start to look around.  Can I just tell yall that ghetto big girls are another breed?  Fuck that!  Yes!  I said it.  Big ghetto girls are awf da chain!!  Let me clear something up.  If you are black and bigger than size 14, you're BIG.  If you can fit a size medium top but gotta squeeze in a pair of sized 20 jeans (for yall bottom-heavy broads), you're considered BIG.  I know, cuz I am two sammiches short of a 16 myself.  So I know.  For my white and asian girls, yall know..if you are in double digits, your ass is BIG.  I say all of this to say that my poor black sistas c'mon now.  I know the little ghetto fashion stores sell all sizes but cut yourselves some slack mamas!  Printed and painted-on jeans are the fashion craze right now.  I am aware of that.  But if your ass and thighs give you back prollems, you need to raise up out dem jeans.  I saw at least 6 BIG girls in those painted-on stretch jeans.  And they have the nerve to wear baby tees and tie knots in the back so their butts can stick out.  That aint cute yall!  Especially if you're 5'2".  I know Ray and 'nem tol' you you wuz phat2def and that may be true (I know), but let's try to ease up on that look a little bit k?
