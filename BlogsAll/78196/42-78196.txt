Pussy Control    Something's definitely wrong with my brain.  I had the wildest freaking dream last night.  I dreamt that I had "relations" with my cat.  How awful is that?  In my dream, my cat morphed into some subhuman catperson and chased me around my apartment.  Once caught, I was clawed to the ground and my cat actually licked my butt and then I ran for my life.  AAAGGGGHH!!  WHAT KIND OF WORLD IS THIS!!  Am I crazy??!!!  I've NEVER EVER had a hint of a thought about doing anything with animals okay so this was an intrusion of my REM sleep.   Dammit Jim!  To make matters worse, why was his fat ass outside my door this morning gazing into my eyes as if to say, "Didja like dat Big Stuff??"  His meow made me wanna kick him in the belly just based on principle.  I cannot believe I dreamt this sick shit!     Has anyone else dreamt about cat rapings?  I doubt it.  Now for the record, I'm NOT undersexed, my love life is close to perfect, and I can't stand my cat.  He and I have a love/hate relationship and he doens't even like me anymore for real.  I've read about cat people before.  Maybe it was a partial abduction in my sleep and they made me think I was dreaming so this cat creature could "have at me".  Oh my God, I need prayah!!!   I'm scared to go home for fear that my cat left me a love letter on the bed or cooked dinner for me, some sick shit like that.  How will I face him tonight?  Maybe this is my punishment for liking pussy or for treating him so terribly bad.  Whatever the reason, I swear it wasn't premeditated.  I think instead, I need to get PREMEDICATED before I go nite nite.  This cannot happen again or I'm gonna turn myself in.  Claude hamercy!!!
