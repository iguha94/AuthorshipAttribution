Today's Dedication   I'd like to dedicate today to my buddy,   Kyi .  I met her online a little over a month ago and she and I were at the same nightclub on Friday.  Not only is she a cutie, but she is very sweet.  But here's the funny part.  I was so fucked up that night!  I went with my good friend P_Lady but before we left, we decided to get drunk first.  So I came up with a brilliant idea..lol  Why pay the bartender when you have hella booze at your house?  We both went to the store and bought big bottles of punch, poured half of it out and replaced it with vodka.  Needless to say, we both finshed them and then hung out with Kreg and Nem so you know a sista was KRUNK!!!  And it was BAD!!  I can't tell you how much I partied that night.   So yeh, Kyi and I chat on the daily and I told her I'd be at the club on Friday.  By the time she saw me, I was 2 sheets to the wind!   Why was I sitting in the corner trying to keep my eyes open and she walked up to me with this big ol' pretty smile.  I tried as best I could to compose myself and not look like a rock star gone bad.  She's really sweet and has a warm personality in person (usually Internet chicks are scary). Not to mention the fact that she's prettier than her pic.  So I'd like to dedicate today to Kyi for being so nice to my drunk ass.  Hugs Kyi!!!
