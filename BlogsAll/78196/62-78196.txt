Today's Dedication   I dedicate today to  Vida Verde , one of my best friends in the whole world.  I love this girl to pieces man (even though I aint seen her inna month-a-Sundays).  Today is dedicated to her because she rox.  She really does!   She informed me that she hasn't been laid in a minute.  Translation: months.  And to think, she's a knockout!   I told her I'd do this because anyone that fine who can hold out that long..hmmmm...needs her own day.  So Ms. Vida Verde!  (drumroll please) Today is yours, the world is your canvas, and I love you to pieces!  Imma put my feelers out there to see if I can score you some ass.  Maybe we should hang out or hold auditions for the most phattest, fantabulous ass in the citay!  Work aint hard for Ms. Vida she's "connected" with a really interesting way of looking at life.  Her blog would blow mine out of the water, but I can't seem to convince her to do it!     See, we go way back to when I was a straight girl caught in a sick dick trap.  Oh it was so awful (please, no).  We bonded quickly and I took her on an orgasmic tour of a lifetime (no I didn't do it to her - freaks).  I simply "shared" some of my self-loving secrets (lol that sounds like one of those silly books).  How to love yourself, blow your own back out, and share with your friends.  Ever since that moment, we've been bosom buddies (evil laugh - I miss my buddy).  Now, she has her own key to THE GATE.  I was never invited, but not bitter.  I love you Vida!  Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
