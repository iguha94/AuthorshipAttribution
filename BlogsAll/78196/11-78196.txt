Okay, across the way from is is     Bashful    and I'll tell you why.  I've never heard this dude say one word.  PERIOD.  He hasn't uttered a thing since I've been here, which would be right after I got a pink slip from my dotcom cake job.  So for almost 5 months now, he's said nothing.  I'm afraid to bless him when he sneezes.  Would that make him a schizophrenic dwarf if this becomes an obcession?  No words, sneezes a lot.....Bashful Sneezy?    And lastly, my favorite:     HAPPY   !  That would be my boss.  WIth his overjoyed ass.  First of all, we are pals.  When I say that, not only do I mean we're cool but have a blast here at work AND have been known to   party like animals ! This fool is awf da leash!  We both turn 'em up and then burn 'em down on the regular, not to mention have excess recess while on the clock.  It's nothing for us to go outside and "play" for two hours and then come back and send jokes to each other via email.  He's just one happy guy.  I'd say a cross between (here I go wiff da half-breed shit) a wannabe pimp and a white collared college boy.  He's funny as hell.  So he'd definitely be my HAPPY.  The good thing is I can get away with murder here cuz "upper management" (minus BIG SHOULDERS) loves our work.  Our production is through the roof.  GO TEAMWORK!     So yes, I'm the broke down Snow White.  Let's see...my name for today?  Hmmmm...  Nona Snow and the 5 Midget Lovers.  Hell.. I don't know.  Maybe Doc can drop some knowledge on meh.
