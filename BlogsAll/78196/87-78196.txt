The Ex Factor   Oh lawd, my ex girlfriend is on her way to see me.  This should be a real blast (sigh).  I was just sitting here thinking of how I was gonna post my weekend update when I get THE CALL.  She's been in Florida for the past 6-7 months and has now returned here for a while.  The last time she came to visit me, it wasn't nuttin' nice (sigh again).  Now I'm here alone, Evermean's at work, and the Ex is on her way here.  DRATS!  Why oh why did I say yes.  Yall should see me sitting here with the   blown face , knowing good and dayumed well this meeting isn't gonna be smooth.  I know she's gonna give me the sad face and make me feel extra bad for finding another partner.  FUCK!     She's such a sweet person and honestly, our relationship did have it's good points.  But there's something about the whole EX FACTOR that makes your former partners turn into evil beings.  She took me to hell and back and then back again, gave me a VIP pass and left me to rot in hell, yes she did.  I didn't even know she had it in her to be so conniving and manipulating.  So what did I do?  I turned my bitch guage on HIGH and refused to take anymore of her bullshit (and then came Evermean..lol).  The truth is, she couldn't take what she'd dished out and bounced on my ass.  We had our good times, yes, but she took me through the RINGER and then abandoned me (and ran off to Florida).  Since she left our conversations have consisted of the following statements:   I hate you   You should've known I was coming back   But you left ME, dammit!   You never loved me   You're way too immature to understand   I hate you   But you left ME, dammit!   Are yall following me?  Well this will be my first time seeing her since August.  This should be a real treat.  Dammit Jim!!!!!
