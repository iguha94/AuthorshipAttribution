Okay, yall remember I was hungry last Friday right?  Well, I thankfully I didn't have to rob any birds or anything like that.  I simply went home, got my paycheck taken care of and bought myself a hot plate.  Speaking of a hot, there's another product I'd like to complain about today.  Okay last night I was feeling pretty domestic, so I decided to cook for my sweetie.  Moonily, I was wisking about in the kitchen, feeling the love as my honey watched me, TV, and drank beer.  Figuring my dish was complete, I opened the oven to get it out.  I felt a rush of heat on my eyelids and upon closing my eyes (after taking the food out), the heat grew more intense.  My friggin eyelashes were piping hot and they felt like they singed my eyes.  So I take a wet paper towel and try to cool off my lids and that's when I realized what the problem was.    This is the culprit!  I've lived by this stuff since Stacy Lattisaw was the shit.  I cannot leave home without it and last night it let me down.  The funny part is I was going down in the kitchen and my sweetie was looking at me all sweet sweet thinking I was flirting with her by blinking and my frigging eyes were on fiyah!!!  Love really makes you do pitiful things. I'm mad she had no idea I was picking up burnt up eyelashes off the floor.  That part's not funny cuz it hurt like hell, but I kept it together.  Today, my eyelashes are extra thin, not cuz I'm protesting one of my favorite products, but because I aint gots no mo man!!!!
