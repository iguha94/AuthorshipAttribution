Tie the Knot, Glad I Didn't   Song lyrics really make you think, man.  I'd like to dedicate these to Mr. W.P.L.  I'm glad I chose the path I did, or that knot woulda asphyxiated me.  And I'm not too fond of choking to death....physically or emotionally.  Thanks for these words,   Ms. Costa .       Mr. Nothing's got a lot He's got a lot to say He's good at being what he's not Gives nothing away Another day goes on by And he never speaks his heart He takes his chance with what he's got It's too late now to stop  You push and you pull and struggle with the knot It's tying you up while you're fadin' You give and you take and take what you got Round and round 'till it breaks and You push and you pull and struggle with the knot It's tying you up while you're fadin' into your lie  Mr. Nothing is late He's running out of time He questions whether chance or fate will ever show a sign Looks to the sky above For a glimpse of what it means And never never never make Make no sense to him  You push and you pull and struggle with the knot It's tying you up while you're fadin' You give and you take and take what you got Round and round 'till it breaks and You push and you pull and struggle with the knot It's tying you up while you're fadin' into your lie  You push and you pull it    10+ years down the tubes, but a sista can breeve easily right now...TODAY (damn right).  Cleansing can be so beautiful.  (evil laugh)
