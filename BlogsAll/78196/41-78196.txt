The Comedy Academy     Public Service Announcement     Some folks wonder where I get some of my comedic talent from.  Well truthfully, since I graduated from the Comedy Academy, I've been able to hold it down awf da ha ha's.  I have my roommate Professor Tini to thank because had it not been for her, I'd still be a dry bean from C.O. City.  But now that Professor Tini gave me my papers, my imagination is out of control.   See last night's episode made me think.  First of all, Officer Evermean and I were on the computer cuz she was helping me design the logo for our "house" and Tini walks in frustrated and drunk.  Just so you know, Tini is awf the hook sober so imagine her drunk.  My roommate is the funniest person I've ever met in my life.  She can give Bernie Mac some go man I'm tellin' ya.  Anyway, she stumbles in last night and Evermean and I proceed to tell her something that a friend of hers did.  Angry, she goes on a tangent about how she was going to beat his ass and he would walk to work tomorrow morning.  She went on to say that he would have corns on his feet by the time he got there cuz she was gonna make him walk.  That his corns would be so bad, he'd have a vegetable medley in his boots.  (lol)  Then how bout she said that Ben Gay was going to be his best friend cuz she's gonna make see to it that Authur Rytiss was gonna KRUNK his joints up.  So then, she got angrier and asked Evermean for her pepper spray cuz she was gonna go and "season his ass up" by going out like Emeril and "KICKIN' IT UP A NOTCH --- BAM!!!"  When I say we laughed until we cried, that's an understatement.   I just HAD to give Tini a shoutout cuz that shit was funny.    You too can be funny.  Just send a self addressed stamped metal box with rubber gloves, a mask, goggles, an Antrax testing kit, two packs of Top Papers, and a cornflower blue crayon to:    The Comedy Academy c/o Emeril & the Pee Wee Pips Attn: Tini "the Kracken" Martini 5000 LOL Lane ShitBFunny, Maryland 20000-5555
