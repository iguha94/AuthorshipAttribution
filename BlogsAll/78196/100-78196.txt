Today's Dedication     I've decided to dedicate today to Swan Brooner.  Okay, before yall bite my head off, lemme explain why (this is funny).  Yesterday I was bored, so I watched  Living Dolls  on HBO.  Why?  I don't know, it just seemed interesting.  Saw the whole thing about little pageant girls and how their parents push them to the limit for these stupid titles.  I know most of you think of Jon Benet Ramsey..blah blah blah..Yeh I know.  It's sickening how they do these children.  Some of the southern mothers are SICK!     Anyway, I felt so bad for this little girl.  I saw how stressed she was and so young (5 years old), practically forced to wear tons of makeup, hair extensions, compete against other little girls, and deal with her trashy assed mother's put-downs.  So I'm sitting there deeply saddened cuz she kept trying and at the end when she won...I BUSTED OUT CRYING.  Awf da, "Awww..go Swan!!!!"  Can yall see me crying out loud in the house by myself?..lol When Swan won the Miss Gingerbread title, I cried like a bitch.  For some reason, I was touch and really happy to see that she finally won a big title.  At the same time, I wanted to bitchslap her mother.  I can't believe I actually cried yall.  I'm not talking about just tears falling down my cheeks, I was crying like the Cowardly Lion.  It was so funny, I had to call Tini and tell her, then I decided to blog about it.     For the record, I don't agree with pushing and exploiting little girls in this pageant business.  But at the same time, it really touched my heart to see this little girl receive something that she worked so hard for.  I still can't figure out why I got so emotional.  That shit was just sad man.
