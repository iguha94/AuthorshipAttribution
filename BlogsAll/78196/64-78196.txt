Home Alone   Why am I at home today?  Why?  Considering it's Friday, I stayed up to the wee hours of the night, and it was so dayumed cold in my room this morning, I STAYED THE FUCK HOME.  Man, I saw my breff when I woke up.  I did.  Plus I was awf da teef chatta like a mug.  Last night was a nightmare!  My toes almost fell off b/c I don't own a pair of real socks.  I'm a girl okay? I wear only trouser socks so yall know I was wearing about 8 pairs last night and they didn't do any good.  So I wake up awf da bittas b/c my breff is in my face, my toes are cold and my nose is numb. I had an attitude and said no worky for me.  I couldn't bear to get in the shower as cold as it was and I wasn't going to work stale.  No way.  So I called in stinky.  Told my boss that it was cold, I couldn't move, and I'll holla at him on Monday.     What am I doing now?  Well, I just got finished talking to my ex-bf.  He's a real pill sometimes.  Men.  They get all moony with you one day and then they find a sick way of reminding you that your pussy was all that keeps them thinking about you.  They reel you in just so you open your heart up to them and then they stick a blade in your chest.  That's him.  I think he's bipolar really.  Either that, or he's finding himself.  Why is that?  I'd say the common denominator for all of my past relationship break-ups was......they FIND THEMSELVES after me.  Where the hell were you when I came a knockin'?  Why couldn't you FIND YOURSELF before you met me?  Is it me?  Am I that intense?  Do I suck the lives out of these people?  Am I too much, pumpkin?  Got Indigestion?  Leave Nona's ass alone and find yourself!  Fuck it! Go!  Find yourself motherfuckers!  Go on!  Beat it!  Like MC Lyte says,  "I gots feelinz inside, I know who I am!"   I guess I'll start taking that as a compliment. Maybe I can FIND a reason to give a fuck about this.
