So Smelly and I just finished IMing and we made plans to go out for a few drinks this evening to catch up.  Like how her new name is Smelly?  Cuz really...my new name should be "Joe CuttheSmelly".  I reak today.  My pits are fully loaded and I am ready to take a motha out.   We are going to have drinks at Cosmos, our new hometown hangout.  $5 Stoli/Vanillas, not a bad bargain.  Although, last week, when I went with Reets, I spilled my complete first drink down my leg and into my bookbag.  It was nice.  And now I smell like a walking drunkard. I guess I have to put off cleaning more of my room until tomorrow.  I am really a crazy mother fucker.  The minute I knew that I would be having drinks instead, I immediately formulated a new plan as to how to still not miss out on the evening I was planning on having.  I am still going to empty out some of my drawers and organize some papers.  I will just wait to do my trunk tomorrow.  Its ok.  Not the end of the world.   I always have to have everything timed by like the minute.  It's a sick habit that I need to quit asap.   It's making me go quazy in my head. I am so hungry for lunch today.  I know I should have a salad and/or a cucumber.  But what I really want is a pineapple.   COVERED IN CHEESEBURGERS. It's just that my body accepts fat so much more easily than it accepts exercise or health food.   I gotta lose my gut someday, k?
