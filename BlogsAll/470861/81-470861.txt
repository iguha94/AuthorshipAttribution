30 minutes until MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND! I remember when I was younger, this weekend used to be a huge family weekend for picnics, outings, etc.   Now that I am older, it is really only a weekend for getting fucked up and sleeping.  My how priorities seem to change. Paul just called me at work.  It was a very base conversation.  I couldn't open up to him at all.  I couldn't get past this week.   He was fine on the phone.  He was joking around with me and being kind of sarcastic.  But to be honest, I definitely wasn't in the mood for HIS sarcasm or humor.  Everyone else is fine.  But his just grates on me today.  I miss him and I still feel weird about this week with him.  I got off the phone as quickly as I could. He did seem upset that I wanted to get off the phone.   At least he feels something. Today after work I am going to get pizza with Rizza and then off to Penelope's where I plan to get as fucked up as possible.   It is Friday night afterall.  Time to do it up.  I haven't been over to her house in a couple of weeks.  It has just been so hectic.   Rita is leaving for Corning.  Kelly has to work most of the weekend.   It will be a blissful time of sleeping, eating, cleaning my room, watching movies, sleeping, eating, masturbating, playing on the computer, eating again. Edward is supposed to call too.  Fun. Maybe going out for drinks tomorrow and Sunday too.  Yikes.   My body screams stop...but my need for illusion screams GO.
