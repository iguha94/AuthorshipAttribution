Another day spent shoveling shit.  In actuality, my shit is in the form of data entry and answering the phones.  People are just fucking rude sometimes.  Most of the time...in NYC.  At first it really scared the piss out of me.  But now, I almost welcome the unwarranted aggression of other people.  Those are becoming my favorite calls to field.  It's kind of a game.  Like, how can I handle what this other person is throwing at me while still making them feel like an asshole for trying to talk above me?   In other words:  You're FUCT! Today I had egg, cheese and bacon on a roll for breakfast.  BACON IN A JEWISH PLACE.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Then I strung the Rabbi up from the ceiling.  Ahhh...the satisfaction of being a Goyim. This girl I work with, we shall call her Penelope...she and I have become good friends and brother and sister in turmoil.  She is working on this project for the Development Portion of our office...it is fucking hysterical.  These ladies that are supposed to be the PR group that raises all the money for our non-profit organization...they are, for a lack of better words, mentally retarded.  They can't form sentences, dress well, or possess any sort of sense of humor.  Whatever...it is so hard to explain how absolutely ABSURD these women are.  And I sit back and laugh.  Laugh cuz these are the people telling ME how to conduct myself at work.  Penelope gets on the verge of smashing the fax machine sometimes.  One time she slammed it on the counter and I ran for my life.  My job is a cross between WWF Smackdown and a fucked-up Jewish version of the slow class in highschool.   Hee?  Hee. BUT IT'S MOTHA FUCKIN FRIDAY!  I love the weekend.  Especially Friday nights. Staying up until the crack of dawn and then sleeping through the shitty part of Saturday.  Alright, must go shave my pubes in the bathroom before I go home.  Later...
