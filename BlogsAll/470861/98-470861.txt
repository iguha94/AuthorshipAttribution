Back.  Didn't you always hate those people that when writing in your yearbook or a letter or whatever, they are like: "Gotta go shower, be back in a minute."  And then it would be "Hi...so I am back". I think you understand the point I am trying to make. So I gotta drive home today.  I am very excited to go to my place in Albany.  My parents have planned some very fun things for my birthday.  Holy fuck I am going to be 25!  Um.  Yeah...at 25 I thought that I would DEFINITELY be piss ass broke working for a Jewish organization.  Hmmm.  yeah. Tonight, my parents and I are going to drink some wine, smoke some bowls, eat tacos, and just enjoy being in eachother's presence.  I don't get to see them nearly enough.  Tomorrow, we celebrate my birthday and I have no clue what could be in store for me.  Kind of fun.   Lies. REAL fun.  I just wish I could take a quick nap before I drive home.  That would be ideal. I feel like as I type, my brain just goes soft and here I sit dumb and brain softed.  No headache, but no intelligence either.  Kind of a horrible trade off if you ask me.   Also, my eyes go lazy after two seconds of not blinking.   I might be tired. Yeah, that's it.   OK, so I gotta go.  I feel like I am in outer space right now. Ian is in Rita's office talking and talking and talking and talking... Should it annoy me? cuz it does.  He is just so....so...so...oh I don't know.  Nice? Yeah...he is just so nice.   Balright...goodnight and goodmorning.  HAPPY GAY PRIDE ALL!
