Rita and I just had lunch together.  We went to this little restaurant called "The West End".  Rita had a diet coke with lemon and I had 3 glasses of chardonnay.  We split the nachos.  Then we both came back to work.  Totally enjoyable.  It was nice to sit and just talk the two of us.  Doesn't happen all that often these days, even though we totally live together.  You know how it is. Penelope and I are trying as hard as we can to get through today.  Both of us want to up and quit as soon as feasibly possible.  I say feasibly, cuz hell...we don't get unemployment unless we get canned.  So here we sit, plugging away at our nonsense.   I feel a little bit better today than yesterday.  I am a wee bit more controlled.  But only a WEE.   Paul hasn't contacted me in days.  I fucking hate long distance relationships.  He sent me a text message from his cell phone this morning, which was sweet...but get on the fucking horn.  He had all weekend to call me and didn't.  It just bothers me.  My brother is leaving for 3 years and he hasn't even called to check up on me - to see how I am doing.  I need him to see how I am doing.  And I guarantee that he won't ask me a single thing about the situation, unless I prompt him to do so.  Which I definitely won't.  I hate having to teach him a lesson.  In fact, I am not really teaching him anything.  I have tried that in the past and it never works.  He...OH...fuck it.  I have had enough.   A fucking student...who is rather cute...needs some help with something.  He just pulled out a laptop and now I jizz.  He has a personal laptop?  That is kinda hot.  Especially when he is not hideous.   "I gotta go".
