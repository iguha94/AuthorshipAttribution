Just want to say one more thing: Paul told me over and over this week how much he "truly loves me".  He very rarely said it first in the past.  And now he is saying it all the time.  I can see it in his eyes, feel it in his touch.  He gives me everything I could ever ask for and more.   You know, I hate those people that gush and gush about their boyfriend.  Especially when I went through my period of not having one.  But it is so hard not to gush when after 2 years and some odd months, we can just fall deeper and deeper in love.  He is the one person that I really never get sick of.  He makes me laugh.  He makes me feel special.  He makes me feel smart, important, and safe.  I could never have asked for someone better than him.   It's such a pure and innocent love.  And because of all this, it is so difficult NOT to gush.   Rita said to me something that stuck in my head.  It was this: "I think you are 'it' for Paul.  I think that, given the right circumstances, he could commit to you forever."   At first, I was shocked by this.  But the more I thought about it, the truth I see in it.  Could he really want to settle down with me?  I could NEVER do such a thing.  Not that it wouldn't work, but because I am way too selfish still to even ponder the idea.  It just got me thinking...I am 25.  My parents had me when they were 26.  So...is this the time when I should be starting to think of these things?  When all of my friends are thinking of marriage and babies...is it crazy for me NOT to be thinking of these things?  Gosh.  I want to be 21 forever.  Or even 22 or 23.  At 24, things start to get too serious and real for my liking.   Oof dah!
