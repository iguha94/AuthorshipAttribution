"Stop and smell the roses."   This is a saying that I wish I could apply to my life.  But I just don't know how to re-train my personality to do so.   Kelly, Rita and I were having a convo. the other night about how I am always "rush around" and they are always "can we please just take our time".  I wish I could just slow everything down so that I didn't always feel like there is more fun to be had.  Know what it is?  I have to work on MY schedule.  I am one of those people that never just ups and does something.  Everything I do has to be thought out and planned.  For example, if a friend invites me to lunch at 10am that day...I will always say no.  Even if I don't have plans, I would still rather not do anything, cuz mentally I didn't have time to prepare myself.  It is becoming kind of an obsession. I love going out and getting drinks.  But if you don't ask me to do it at least 2 days in advance, the odds of me going with you are slim, but mostly slim to none.  With a focus on the none.   "Stop and smell the roses." Spontanaiety and I are good friends.  But only when I am ready for it a week in advance.  Hmph.  I need to lighten up a bit.
