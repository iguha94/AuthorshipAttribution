Gosh.  It is so busy at work today.  It is Passover time and my job is run by the Jewish.  ;) With it being Passover, there are students here selling their Chametz.  I don't even know if that is the word.  Plus, we are planning Seders and also taking care of the normal business.  Penelope and I are out of our minds today.  But it makes the day go faster and I like that. Mariah just called and firmed up the plans for my trip to Boston tomorrow.  I am very excited.  She is actually leaving for Colorado on Thursday.  I am bringing her to the airport and waiting there with her until she gets her scared little ghouls on that plane.  Poor thing.  I would be terrified, but I know she will be ok.  How exciting!  She never gets to go anywhere.   Has anyone heard the new song by Vanessa Carlton?  I love her!  I believe that she is supposed to be my new girlfriend, but I had to break her heart last night.  You see, it is about 11pm last evening and the phone rings.  This is what happened: Me:  Hello? Vanessa:  Hi.  Is Joe there? M:  This is Joe.  V:  Joe, it's Vanessa.  How are you? M:  Vanessa!  Wow.  I was just listening to your new song.  What's up with you?  It's been too long. V:  I know.  I have been so busy, what with the new music career and all. J:  Yeah, I know how it is.  I had to do this duet last week with Mariah Carey.  Oh, she can be such a pain in the ass. V:  Right?  I try to avoid her as much as possible.  Look, I need to talk to you about something. J:  Sure, go ahead.  I have a few minutes. V:  Well, you see...I was kind of thinking that we could be boyfriend and girlfriend. J:  Oh Vanessa...I...um...gee...well...the thing about it... V:  What Joe?  What are you trying to say?  Don't you love my new song????? J:  Well, uh...I actually do.  But Vanessa, I am-  V:  Not interested?  What?  Am I too young?  Am I too pretty?  Am I not worth your time? What is it Joe?  WHAT IS IT? J:  WOW!  Vanessa, can you just hold on a sec? V:  Fuck you Joe.  Fuck you. CLICK! Then she just hung up.  Damn.  Girl's got a temper.  I was just trying to tell her that I am gay.  But she just wasn't having it. Please, still go out and buy her cd.  She didn't mean to act the way she did.  Bitch just fell in love with me.
