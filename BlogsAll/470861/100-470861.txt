So once again my mom is the most amazing woman on the planet. I have been researching car rental places for Paul and I for the big vakay.  The best deal I could find was $300 for the week (insurance included) for a shitty cavalier.  That is an impossibility.  Paul and I are not spending all of our money on a car rental.  Cuz then the only fun we would have would be driving around town.  And then driving some more.  We'd probably take a break for a bite to eat and then jump in the car again to do some more driving. I call my mom and explain to her that I don't want to spend my vacation driving around town and doing nothing else. She's like: "Give me 5 minutes". I sit patiently and wait for her to call back. When she does, she informs me that she has reserved us a car for $167 total.  (insurance included) UM!  Is this woman an angel sent from God?  Cuz I think maybe.  Now, not only do we have a phat place to stay in, we have a car to drive around wherever we want.  The beach is about an hour away from where we are.  We would have taken a bus, or ridden bikes.  HAHAHAHA But now...eh, we jump in our ride and cruise on down to the sand.  I might even park it right on the beach.  :-D And the best part of the whole thing is....WE PICK IT UP AT THE AIRPORT!  AWESOME!  No cabs ever! I love you mom.  You are constantly saving my ass.
