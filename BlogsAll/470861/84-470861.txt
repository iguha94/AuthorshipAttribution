The day is almost over!   Not a horrible day today.  It went by a little faster than yesterday, but that is only because I had more work to do.  I think the highlight of the whole day was when I had grilled cheese and fries for lunch.  I just love it.  I think it could be my favorite meal on the planet.  The only thing that would have made it better would have been less grease and more pizza. :-() SNARF I am exhausted.  I definitely need to get some rest tonight.  But I also have to get a bag.  No, not a bag.  A FUCKING BAG! You get it now. My eyelids are what I like to call...heavy.  But my attitude is pretty good.  Rita said, last night after my breakdown, that today would be a "light day" for me.  And she was absolutely right.  I have no need for the super-absorbance pads.  I will stick with the lighter days.   Nothing could be as bad as last night was, so really I didn't have much worry.  The only thing that could have been harder to deal with would have been getting hit by a bus...and even that has its advantages.  (getting out of work you goons!) The guy that cut my hair today was the nicest man alive, but I think he gave me a shitty haircut.  What is with me and shitty haircuts lately?  After he finished...he spikes my hair to the ceiling and is like: "How is the length?"  I say: "The LENGTH is perfect."  He's like: "Great!", removes the plastic cover from my clothes and lowers my chair. "Um, aren't you going to style it at all...or are you just going to leave it sticking straight up?" Leave it sticking straight up obviously cuz my hair looks like it did in 8th grade.  So does my body.  I ate grilled cheese and fries today.  :( So glad the weekend is coming.  So motha fuckin glad. Alright...I gotta go pack up my shit and get ready to leave.  It is 4:42pm afterall!
