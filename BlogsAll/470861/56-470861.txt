So...random disgusting moment of the day... I typed in www.blogger.com in the address box of Internet Explorer.  Unfortunately for me, I forgot the period and typed wwwblogger.com instead.  What popped up was the most horrifying thing I have ever seen.  It was an abortion site.  I couldn't believe the main page and quickly tried to cancel out of it.  When I typed in www.blogger.com in the address box of the abortion webpage, another abortion page popped up and there was a picture of a black baby that was aborted and tossed in the dumpster.  It's arms, legs, and body were chopped off and the top of the skull was fully disconnected and smashed.  I about threw up and burst into tears.  OMIGOD.   I suggest you do NOT forget the period in your web addresses folks.  What may pop up will scare you for the rest of your life.   SO! In other news...well, i guess there isn't any real other news.  I was going to just wax-philosophic in here, but instead, i sit here trying desperately to get the image of little black babies murdered out of my head.  DAMN that shit was sick. I got a couple slices of pizza for dinner.  Imagining tonight to be a very low key, lay in bed kind of evening.  I got some shit to do and luckily feel so much better.  Otherwise, no shit would get done.  Honestly, I can't guarantee that shit will get done anyway.   Rita was just washing her face and accidently sucked a drop of soap into her nose.  Then she went to blow out the soap drop and a huge bubble emerged from her nose.  HAHAHAHAHA.  I just wish I was in the bathroom to see it.  Alright dawgs....that is going to be it for today.  HOW EXCITING was my blogger today?  On a scale of 1-10, I would probably give it a 2.5 and  the only reason it gets that good of a rating, is cuz of aborted black babies and random soap bubbles. The end.
