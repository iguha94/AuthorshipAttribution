So the best thing just happened.  Rita and I just went upstairs to decorate Angie's door.  We put posters of graduation, quotes, pictures, cards, etc.  As we finished, the buzzer rang and she and I snuck down to our apartments; covertly hiding from FUCKFACES' friend Jen who was waiting outside.  When we got back into Kelly's room, Rita and I waited for them to clear the stairs and then opened the door and listened to CUNT MOTHER FUCKER STUPID FAGGOT ASS FUCKFACE say: "Look at this, it kinda makes me want to puke". Now...are we fucking kidding?????? How DARE he?  I mean...HOW DARE HE?   Being fair, I realize that I say shit about fuckface all the time behind his back.  But he has never heard it.  Actually, even if he did hear it I didn't care...but it just wasn't the same.  He said that comment, insinuating that we are no where near the friends with Angie that he is.   Sorry...but are you a fucking retard?  Fuckface...you have been around 3 days.  I have known Angie for 5 years.   Faggot...you ain't NEVER gonna be to Angie what I am.  I don't care if you are the last two lesbos on earth.  You will NEVA BE!   So I go to my journal and I say hurtful things cuz that is the only way that I know how to vent.   If he has the balls to say the same comment to Angie...then so be it.  But I am sure he doesn't.  And I DREAD the idea that Angie would entertain any such remark.   She wouldn't right? Whatever...Rita and I did what we could for this occassion...and hopefully Angie understands that.   As for Fuckface...well this whole thing will go no further...but just so we all know...I hope this kid comes into some major trouble in his life.   And if not...I will cause the trouble.   ;) I feel better now.   It's just that I spent a good portion of my day putting this shit together...and then having this ass say something flippantly about it actually hurt.   I guess the main question is...why does it hurt? I really need to get some tougher skin.
