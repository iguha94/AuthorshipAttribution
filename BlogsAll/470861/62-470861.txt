I have two major goals for this summer.   The first is to obtain, through whatever means necessary, a flat stomach.  It is imperative that this happens.  I can't believe that it is already April 16th.  What have I been doing???  Shoving my face with everything I can get my hands on??? Oh yeah.  That is exactly what I have been doing. The second goal is to get a WICKED tan this summer.  Darker the better.  I have started tanning and now with the beautiful weather, I will be at the park soaking in the rays every single day.  I want to be African American.  Black, if you will.  Last summer, I kind of gave up on the whole "looking good" thing.  This summer...I MUST make up for lost time.   I guess I have a third goal...but this goal only happens if I accomplish goals one and two.  I would LOVE to go to a beach this summer.  I haven't been to a beach since like high school.  I don't go to pools, the ocean, the lake, or even a pond.  I will NOT be going to any sort of beach-esque place unless I have a flat stomach.  Not necessarily a 6-pack stomach, although that is ideal.  It simply has to be flat.  All I want to do is go to a beach, so can I keep up with the damn sit-ups???  I just have to keep reminding myself how wonderful it will be to be a part of the beach community.  CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH.  (This is me doing crunches at my desk.  And if I really do get this flat stomach...I get to buy an actual bathing suit!!!!  That is the best part.  I know the exact kind of trunks that I want...I just need to look decent in them.  I am hoping to have this all together by the beginning of July.   I should probably stop eating garbage one of these days too.  That would help.
