Good morning...GOOD MORNING!  I only have to be at work today until 1pm.  AAAAAAAAAAAAMAZING!  It is this holiday I like to call Purim.  Some celebration of sorts.  I am celebrating by getting drunk at 2pm in the afternoon.  What a day. I came up with a great idea last night while I was laying in bed playing with myself.   One night, I am going to smoke a bowl and sit at my blogger and type for 15 or 20 minutes straight.  I realized that so much goes through my head at night when I am sitting around stoned, blankly staring at the tv.  I love the solitude and peace that comes along with a late night smoke.  But quite often, my mind races and there are so many things that I want to quickly type into my blogger.  So, coming to a blogger near you:  Joe CuttheShit waxes philosophic while under the influence of marijuana's evil control.   Rita and I drove to work today.  THOROUGHLY enjoyable.  And we got a parking spot basically in front of the building.  The only down side---I have to leave every hour to put quarters in the parking meter.  hee. Lately, I have had so many damn boogers in my nose.  Like dry, crusty boogers.  Weird.  But fun to pick and eat.   YAH!  NEVER EAT!  NEVERNEVERNEVERsometimesNEVERNEVER.  (barf) Time to go home yet?
