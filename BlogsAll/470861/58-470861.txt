So I just took the test.  (insert humiliated face here) I am losing my skills.  I thought the test was pretty easy...HOWEVER...it had the exact words on it that I have the hardest time spelling.  I am good with most words.  Even if I have never heard it...but you give me some of the age old common words and I will fuck it up consistently.  The other day Rita says to me: "Joe, spell the word discusting".  I immediately burst out laughing, cuz discusting is one of those words that I believe I know how to spell, but also believe that I get it wrong every time.  I have been spelling it wrong for years.  Discusting is actually spelled DisGusting.  Hmmm. I am not good with the "definitely's", the "absolutely's", the "ly's" that may or may not have that "e" before it.   But either way...I won my 5th grade spelling bee.  And I moved to the next round.  It is one of my best personal stories.  Remind me to tell you sometime.  One funny part of the story is...when I won the 5th grade bee...my parents got me a present.  Anything that I wanted.  Of course I got the dinner of my life and a movie or something.  But the one thing I WANTED was "The Babysitter's Club issue 9, I think.  It was called  Dawn and the Haunted House .   And my parents didn't know that I was from homo-city.   So imagine my suprise when I took the spelling test and this is what I saw:  Not bad. But you probably won't win the big spelling bee.  You got 10/15 correct.  I got some brushing up to do before our big home spelling bee!
