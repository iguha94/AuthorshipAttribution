Blogger...this is your mother....blogger honey, I don't get your entries... A little  Rent  to start the day...imagine if Rent had a song about Blogger?  That would be the lamest thing on the planet. WHAT UP????????????? The weather outside is two things:  Frightful and Delightful all at the same time.  It feels good to have the sun shining down on my face.  The only real downfall to this whole thing is that I stink.  Actually the other downfall is that this weather is just the beginning.  Soon it will be much hotter, much muggier, and much more stink will exude from my pits.   And tits. But I LVOE it and the sun beaming this heavily on me makes me feel good inside.  Good and toasty.   Roti Boti. The "Roti Boti" is this little hole in the wall Indian (or some shit) restaurant near our house.  They have skewers of meat and chicken by the dozens.  It usually smells good there, but I don't know if we are fully allowed inside to eat.  It is all cultural and shit.  Rita promised me that she and I will go there at some point this summer to chow down on this ethnic, greasy, fried food.  We want Kelly to come too, but she has to PROMISE to eat a skewer of beef.  Hey, give the girl a nice full bodied glass of red wine, and she will eat the skewers by the pound.  ROTI BOTI here we come! Another night of not talking to Paul.  Yeah, that makes me happy, especially since he had all last night off from work.  I called him yesterday during the day and left a message, assuming that he would call me at some point last night....um......nope! So anyway... I just love elipses.  I use them always. I guess I don't really have much to say today.  Maybe a little bit later.
