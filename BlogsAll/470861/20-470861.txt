I woke up in the middle of the night last night to find myself doubled over with the worst cramps?  Was it the first case of male period?  Male pregnancy?  Intestinal cancer?  No.  In fact, it was a mad case of the diarrehea explosion.  I ran to the bathroom and had the worst time.  Then this morning, I still feel like I gots to go, but there is nothing left.  And I feel that if I push hard enough, my liver and kidneys are bound to plop into the toilet.  ugh. Today I have to have lunch with my new boss.  He has been hounding me to do so for weeks now and I always cancel.  So I bite the bullet and do it today.  I am sure it will be better than expected.  It just sucks that I have to give up a lunch break to be with people I work with.  I hate that.  My lunch break is my free time away from this place I call BS. The Real World (Chicago) is fucking amazing.  It is quickly becoming my favorite Real World of all time.  And no, not cuz of the gay guy in it.  He is actually the weirdest shit I have ever seen on tv.  I, for the first time in a while, am obsessed with the straight characters, Kyle and Kerry.  They are struggling to not fall for each other, but it is only inevitable.  Kyle has a long time girlfriend, and refuses to cheat.  But whatever, Kerry is throwing everything at him that she can think of...and it is working.  He follows her around like a dog in heat.  Or maybe more like a gorilla in heat, cuz this boy has got a great body.  I love this season. OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  The cramps are killing me.  If I do turn out to be pregnant, I am giving the baby away.  I just can't fuck up my future like that.
