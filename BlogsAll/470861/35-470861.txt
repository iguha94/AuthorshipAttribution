So I came in to work today and got the most amazing suprise ever.  Paul called me at like 9:15am.  Which he never does!  If he calls me at work at all, it will be around 4pm.  But this morning, the phone rings and its him.  I was very shocked.  He was actually on his way to work a double.  Ugh.  I remember those days.  For the am shift he will be shift leading the floor.  Which means he will be a waiter.  And on top of that, he will be in charge of the entire morning staff.  He hates working on the floor and I don't blame him.  Once you go bar you never go back.  Or something like that.  Tonight he will be shift leading the bar.  GOSH!  What a good boy.  He like runs the store.  But anyway...he calls and I say to him, "So when are you working this week?"  He says: "Actually I took the week off so that I could be with you."  WWWWWHHHHHAAAAATTTTT?  I don't think that has happened ever since he and I have been together.  The kid works ALL the time; even when I come for a visit.  I usually get one night with him and one night with Mariah.  Or one night with him and one night alone.  But this week...something happened and he is going to spend the majority of the time with me.  It made me feel so loved.  I couldn't stop saying "thank you".  YAY!
