HOME SWEET HOME.  It feels so good to be home today.  I have done nothing but putter around with my dick in my hands.  I actually spend the first half of the day completely naked.  Talking on the computer naked, making phone calls naked, eating fried eggs naked.  What a day.  Why can't this blogger take off and support my nakedness?   Back to work tomorrow and that sucks.  But at least the week is almost over.  Gotta take more sick days in the future.   Cept next time, don't want to get sick for real. Tonight Kelly, Rita, and I are having dinner together.  We still haven't decided if we are going out for dinner or if we are staying in.  I must admit that I am partial to going out.  Cuz if not, it will be my sorry ass that does the cooking.   Gums bothering me again today.  Why the fuck won't this disease just go away forever???   I dread the day when one of my teeth feels just a little loose.  And then I play with it until it pops out all bloody.   And then I eat it. The cat has been bathing himself for like an hour.  What a priss.   I spoke with Mariah for awhile today.  I miss her like crazy.  She wants me to come visit soon, but there just isn't any time.  She is going through a rough patch right now.  I hate that we don't get to talk as much as we used to.  I hate not knowing every detail in her life.  She is a good girl and an even better singer.  She is the next, well...Mariah.  She has had a wicked case of tonsilitis the past couple of weeks.  She may have to have them removed.  That would be horrible. Mariah tells me that Paul is going crazy without me.  Bout time.  I have been waiting for him to be up my ass for 2 years now.  But once he is...will I still want him to be?  I hate being without him, but I hate not knowing if I can truly commit even more.  Nothing is ever perfect in the life of Joe CuttheShit.  Or for anyone for that matter.
