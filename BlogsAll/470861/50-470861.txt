So the coolest thing happened at lunch today.  I was sitting at the West End   (The West End, 2911 Broadway (@ 113th St.), 662-8830  M-Su 11:30am-2am  Columbia University hangout (it's 1 block southwest of campus) once frequented by Kerouac. Huge sitting areas inside, with o.k. food served till 10pm. Back room hosts bands every Friday and Saturday for $0-10. Cheap pitchers.)  .   I ordered cheese fries and a diet coke.  The cheese fries came and I ate them, but no diet coke.  The waitress comes back to the table and asks how things are...by now I am 30 minutes into my lunch break...I say "good, but I am really thirsty".  She looks at the table and sees that not even a water has graced my path since I have sat down.  She says: "Chardonnay?"  I say: "No, not today.  I will just have a diet coke".  She's like: "Have a Chardonnay, it's on me."  I say: "Well, ok!" She brings me my Chardonnay and I drink it in two seconds.  She comes back about 10 minutes later and says: "Another one?"  I say: "No, just the bill please."  She is like: "Have another one.  It's on me".   DOH?!?!?! "Well, alright", I say.  I then drink the next glass of wine and she brings me the bill.  $4 and change for cheese fries and two glasses of wine.  YAYAYAY!  What a nice suprise.  She is the cutest little blonde girl and she treated me so well.  What a suprisingly good lunch. And cheap!  Almost cheaper than Burger King.   Almost.
