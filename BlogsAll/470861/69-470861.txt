So tonight...Rita and I came home.  Well, usually we DO come home, but tonight was just a little bit different.  We took a cab home cuz we were feeling care-free and fancy-free.  We arrived at the house at 5:45pm, after having the most interesting cab ride of our lives.  It was just so thought provoking and intriguing that even Rita and I couldn't find a way to fully discuss it.   When we got home, we decided to have a glass of wine on our porch.  She was waiting for her parents to call and I was waiting for her....well...er...parents to call!  So, we get our glasses of wine, play with the baby for a minute and walk calmly, but steadily to the porch.  (calmly, but steadily...adjectives that are totally unnecessary at this point of the story).  We walk to the front of the house, laughing and talking VERY LOUDLY when I open the first door.  I then go to open the second, and last door, when I look out the window and see Angie's roommate FUCK FACE sitting on the front steps.  I froze in my tracks.  I mean...WHAT?  We had just gotten home like 8 minutes earlier.  Where the fuck did fuck face come from?  Fuck, fuck and fuck!   So I spin on my axle and look at her with the fear.  Fear of DEATH that is.  I say "go".   I say "go".  If you were here right now, you would understand how "I say 'go'" is funny.  You would.  I say it to myself and I laugh.  I'm actually still laughing.  Still...even now still. Okay I have stopped. Rita and I immediately high-tail it back to the apartment and once inside I say: "It's FUCK FACE!  He is on the stairs!"  We pass a look of horror and then invent "the point" of my whole story.....(elipses) Having to decide where to drink our glass of wine, I say: "Come with me."  Rita follows me into my room, onto my bed, and out of my window.   Outside the window is a miniature roof, 2 feet off the ground.  No bigger than me laying down.  And a little wider, but that is only cuz I am halfway to fat ass at this point. We sit on the "roof".  As we begin to smoke our cigarettes and drink our wine, Rita and I both stop to realize that we have just discovered our new hang-out.   Now this is a big deal... Rita and I became BFF when I moved into 56B Liberty Street.  The place that changed both Rita and my life forever.  Ask Kelly about it...she is the only person I have left in my life that understands 56B. Within 56B were 6 people.  (And you know what folks...at this point, I am using real names for minor characters.  I can't keep this shit straight in my head anymore).  Stacey, Jessica, Nina, Erica, Amy, and Joe.  In no particular order.  The 5 of them lived in the house a whole year before, but in my place was a girl names Terri.  (A girl who lives in NYC presently, but none of us talk to on a regular basis...maybe Erica and Stacey, but thats bullshit)   I REPLACED Terri.  End of story.  Debate it all you want...and boy some of these girls will...I replaced Terri.  Okay...that was an unnecessary tangent and now I laugh at myself.  Okay laughing................................................... done. Us 6 were unique and compatible.  There was always a fight going on between someone, but with 6 people it always worked out.  There was always "somewhere to go".   But the ONE PLACE.  The ONLY place where we could all go and be serene was our roof.   The 56B roof was a good 8-9 feet off the ground; 13 at its' hightest point.  Cuz it sloped, you see.  Sloped upwards.  So you always felt like you were falling off.  (I am laughing again.  But this time...nostalgically.) On the roof, the 6 of us (and it was dangerous for 6, usually 12 people on the roof, but we did it) just sat and drank our beers, smoked our butts and just fucking bullshitted.  It was perfect.  It was the reason you moved into 56B.   At some point, I will get into each of these 5 girls and explain why they are perfect; why each of them has flaws and perfection wrapped into themselves. Good people. Very good. So when Rita and I realized that we were sitting on the roof and that it just felt "good", I, for one remembered all the aforementioned.  Wow.   As much as the memories are important and, at this time of my life, so wonderful, I see, for this moment, a new place for the future to take hold.  I see Kelly, Rita and I sitting on the roof this summer and just being.  I see us talking...laughing...sharing...letting go with eachother.  It is our  . How much fun???  And when certain people come over, we can invite them to the roof.   "Hey", we'll say, "You seem like a cool person.  Have ya been to the roof?" I just can't wait.  So tonight ends well.   I feel so relaxed, so calm, so...real.  Is it the calm before the storm?  They say that and it's creepy to think that.   But...great!  Now that I have thought it.....the sounds of crickets outside and the warm spring breeze blowing through the window onto my face is bugging me out!!!! or maybe it's the pot.   whatever....it's always the pot. So I guess that is it.  Wanted to share something that made a difference in my day today. Right now Rita is seeing her parents.  (Big sigh) I am just really excited for her.  The bullshit that she went through to get to this point just adds up to an even more incredible experience. ****Realized tonight that this is no longer a journal.  This has become a way of communicating with each and every one of the people in my life without ever telling them face forward. ******Not what I wanted this to be. *********Not what I intended it to be. ************Hungry now. ****************MMMM.....hot dogs..... So you see... I just look back and read what I have written in the past, because in some way...it's my mini-portfolio.  Not marketable in any way, but my personal portfolio. (And if you really believe that I don't think this shit is marketable, you are lost) (WINKLES!!!) I saw the actual progression from me writing a "journal" type entry to me just writing about and for people I know.  I am suprised anyone not connected to the 4 people in my life even read me.  They just see that I am gay and then they think: "Oh....well gay...he must be a slut...I will write him a discusting and crude email!"   Great idea. But overall, it's my way of communicating with my 4 closest.  5 if you count Edward...but are we counting Edward at this point? I guess that is it.   I still have to do my "Real World" recap from last night's episode, but that will have to wait until I am at work and getting paid to write it.   Member when people said "Peace in the middle East" as like a saying?  I remember it from college or highschool, but I never said it, so I don't know it's true origin.  It was synonymous with "Catch ya Later" and "See ya around".  Well now awadays....Peace in the Middle East, huh?  Weird.   Alright guys.  Girls.  Whoever happens to read this entry.  I wrote a lot today so who knows if anyone will get this far.  Rita is with her parents.  Kelly is at class.  Penelope is at an interview.  wow.  What a day.  What a week.  Man.  What an experience.  I wouldn't trade any of it for a second. Peace in the middle east y'all.
