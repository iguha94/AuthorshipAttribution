CITY HIGH...shumma shum shum...shumma shuuummmm.  I can't get this fucking song out of my head.  And the worst part about it is that I know only two words.  "City High".   Paul called me at work today.  He was adorable on the phone  We shared a few shits and giggles before we got off.  It was a nice and quick talk.  Made me miss him.  :( I am busting ass to get my shit done before I go.  I also have to figure out how to take the cross-town bus to Penelope's house.  YIKES.  I never take the bus.  So it is Creeps McCreeps that I have to get on one today.  I just think it will go so much faster than taking the subway.   Okay....Cleo just explained to me how to take the bus.  She has been so cool lately.  Close to being one of my favorites at work.  Well, there isn't much competition, but she has been excellent.   Last night, Rita and I did Tarot card readings.  It was fun and TOTALLY insightful.  She has a lesbian deck of Tarot cards.  It's funny.  Even the man characters are these big dykes.  I guess it makes sense.  Every dyke I have ever known has been able to predict the future.  (wink wink) Alright, I gots to go and get ready to leave.   Hope all is well with everyone!  Peace be with you and  oh yeah... fuck off.
