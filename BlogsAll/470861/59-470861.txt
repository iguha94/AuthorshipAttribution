So here I sit.  I am blaring Vanessa Carlton and Stevie Wonder at the highest level of volume and screaming along with the lyrics.   Rita and Kelly are having drinks at Jake's Dilemma.  What an interesting name for a bar.  Cuz what IS Jake's Dilemma?  I suppose alcoholism.   At this moment Mary J. is singing about that drama in her life.  But she says "No more!"  Hope she was able to really leave it behind. like I give a fuck. Mary J. seems like a really troubled person.  Like she has had her fill of garbage.  I have this respect for her and I don't even know that much about her.  She seems tough, but she seems scarred to me.  Maybe she carries her hurt with her as a reminder.  She does say "another lesson learned".  What a classy lady. I was so exhausted today at work.  I went into some weird blur at one point...I wasn't tired necessarily (even though I only got about 4 hours of sleep), my body was just done.  I have been exercising (am I serious about that spelling)(wait...is it right?)(I am going fucking crazy) heavily lately and my legs are so sore.  Each step is excruciating.  But I know it is worth it and I have to keep it up.   So Jessica will NOT be visiting this weekend.  What a trial this was!  It is such a long story and I really don't have the energy in me to get into it.  She will most likely be coming next weekend.  Much better idea.  MUCH. What this means though is definitely no trip to Boston next weekend.  I guess that is for the best.  Makes my stomach hurt when I even think about Paul at this point.   Alright...must sign off.  Too mellow for this bloggle  tonight.
