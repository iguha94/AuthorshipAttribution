Devoted 3 hours in the early part of the day to the mundane, the routine...the office. As if I had no other plans later in the day, I arrived at work to tidy up some of those obnoxious "loose ends."  They are not really loose ends, of course, but the stupid details one deals with daily. They become "loose" when one goes on an extended visit elsewhere. In this particular case, New York.  Weather in Cleveland: sunny, mid-seventies, humid....delightful flying weather, right?!   My cab driver spoke of "slapping his bitch", smoking weed and being his own boss. Maybe in his late 40's. I did manage to arrive on schedule and intact. I guess this is most important of all. Steve managed to miss his flight - or should I say, our flight. I had specifically rearranged my flight schedule to fly with him on his first business trip for the company. However, sitting at the airport, I realized that I would be traveling to NYC alone, as we boarded the plane with no Steve in sight. The most irritating part of all of this is the fact that our plane sat on the tarmac for almost two hours while we waited for weather clearance from LaGuardia. Eventually, we were off. I got to New York without a hitch, checked-in at the hotel and took a stroll thru Manhattan. The conference will start in the morning. Must be on BEST behavior. Note to self: do not bitch-slap Laura M.
