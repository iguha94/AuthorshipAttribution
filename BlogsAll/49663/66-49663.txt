I find myself spending any possible moment outdoors. Anything I can do outside...I'm doing it. I realized my intense need to be away from television, computer and radio. I spent all of yesterday out on the Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath...one of my favorite things to do in the CVNRA. I biked 25 miles in the brilliant sunshine along the canal and Cuyahoga River...all the way to Peninsula (where I stopped and had a Corona before starting the whole trip back to Cleveland. To me, there was nothing better than being out there, alone. I had a great afternoon being by myself, but I also had the opportunity to meet lots of people along the way. After a quick nap when I returned home, I went to a party at the home of a friend/coworker. At about 12:30 I was really feeling exhausted, so I headed off home & to sleep. After church this morning, I wandered over to the Tremont Arts Festival in Lincoln Park. After grabbing a coffee at Civilization, I walked along the tree-lined paths looking at all of the different booths and chatting with artists. I thought maybe   Jockohomo  might be there, but alas, I did not find the elusive fellow. Kelly and I spent some time sitting out on our front porch in the sunshine, and managed to see Dan ride his bike past the house. Always good to see old friends. Tonight, I am going to a big family "Hoo-Ha" for my Aunt Sally's birthday (it's also my sister's birthday). Actually, I am looking forward to starting another week at work. Maybe the routine is what I'm craving right now. Since I'm not rehearsing for the first time in over a year, it's taking me awhile to adjust.
