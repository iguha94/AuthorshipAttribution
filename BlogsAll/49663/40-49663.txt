my big gay life (33)     tedious/strenuous    Life out on the town did wonders for this weary soul. The opening at the Center was quite fun and included the usual array of characters...my friends and accomplices from work and a few other folks from around the way. I drove Rachel and her friend Erin. The night was muggy, sticky and heavy with the scent of the early summer blooms. The Center for Contemporary Art was cool and clean, light wood floors and the air scented with expensive perfumes. I ran into a very old friend...someone from my neighborhood where I grew-up...I knew I recognized the face, but couldn't place him. Will! Of course! Will Baker...from Eastview. Right! He remembers me teaching him vocabulary words on the school bus. He was in second grade and I was in fifth. He remembers me teaching him the words  tedious  and  strenuous  words that have, no doubt, come in handy in this life. What a trip to run into someone from so long ago.  Fifth grade...  Afterwards, the party  moved to Touch Supper Club...which included much more drinking and even some dancing. I returned home somewhere around 1:30 (I think) and crashed into bed.  Yesterday was Cleveland's Gay Pride festival downtown on the harbor. We had gorgeous weather...clear and 72 degrees...no humidity. Maggie joined Toby  and me for the day's festivities. We walked along all the booths at the festival, drank lemonade and watched Judy Tenuta do her 45 minute set. I got nicely sunburned and managed, thank god, not to run into too many exes.  whew!  Afterwards, we joined Kelly and John at Johhny Mango for a light supper and drinks. We moved that party to my front porch where we were joined by the infamous Dr. Tom from across the street (always amusing). Like teenagers, we drank beer and played "I never..." Today, Kel and I ran a few errands before each of us headed off to celebrate Fathers Day. Dad was excited to know he got to share his big day with Gay Pride...he's so cool. My dad rocks!!
