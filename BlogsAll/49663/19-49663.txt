It's Time     words and music by Douglas Harvey and Todd Stuart      Here I am  deep in this place  this place where we were  alone and in love  and here I am  so deep in this place  this place where we were  alone and in tears   This is who I am  This is how I feel  so, where are you now?  where are you now?    But it's time (time)  time to say it's over  time to say goodbye  to turn and walk away  yes, it's time (time)  time to say it's over  time to say goodbye  to turn and walk away  turn and walk away   My heart is open  I welcomed you in  your love had me floating  like clouds in the sky  but my heart is aching  from letting you in  you had me singing  love lifting me high  no wonder I'm crying  when it's time, time to say goodbye   But it's time (time)  time to say it's over  time to say goodbye  to turn and walk away  yes, it's time (time)  time to say it's over  time to say goodbye  to turn and walk away  turn and walk away   how could I know  you were walking away?  how could I know  you didn't want to stay?  how could I know  we'd end up this way?   But it's time (time)  time to say it's over  time to say goodbye  to turn and walk away  yes, it's time (time)  time to say it's over  time to say goodbye  to turn and walk away  turn and walk away
