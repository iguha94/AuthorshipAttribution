unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 14  March 8   Hey Todd,         Just a few words, as I know Mr. Sandman is taunting you to bed, hell I'd prolly be too.. ooopps did that thought excrete out of my hand... well..mind you it is that hand...the typing hand... oh, I better stop there...oh my. (N2S:come back to decide if to remove)         So - briefs? boxers? or boxer briefs? or? Not sure if it's too soon to know that intimate detail...but you brought the question up in your boxer-brief email...Just curious.. maybe someday I'll be surprised...and no I'm not horny right now... I have company coming over soon too.. so I too may cut this short all at once and may send before I complete thought has finished. These things usually go late anyway.         I just started taking scuba lessons at the YMCA. Providing we get one more, because we need 4 people for the class to be a go. Are you certified? Maybe there'll be a scuba trip in our future? hmmm.. I can't wait to hear about the Sea World animals, now that is has been swallowed up by Six Flags. I still haven't gone to that park.. like Cedar Point so much more. I think less trash too.         Man this does have to be breif, doorbell just rang... I will continue...more I want to comment.. but hopefully, your night was bearable and I can at least with this boxerbreif email (as thats what I wear) bring a smile (and get your mind outta the gutter) as you lay to sleep waiting for sweet and wonderful dreams to refresh you for a brand new day.  Goodnight (HUG)  Dan P.S. Saturday could work, lets talk about it.      At 04:03 PM 3/8/01 -0500, you wrote:  Dan, My fever-pitched work day has now left me in a state of catatonia. We' supposed to go to this staff party at 4pm. All I want is a nap. So, I am sorry to say, this email will have to be a bit brief...boxer-brief, I think.  N2S (note to self): Must watch Dan scarf down his food sometime. Maybe you and I could have a contest...who can inhale food the fastest?  You came all the way down here and didn't stop in my cube?!? How disappointing.  :(  You said you drove by on your way home from Scuba. Forgive me, but are you talking about Scuba class or a club? I had to take Scuba classes when I worked at Sea World. Yes, I spent 6 years working as a Narrator for all the animal exhibits. You name it, I can talk about it...at GREAT length.  I have a housemate, Kelly, who (obviously) shares the house with me and Toby. She's off in Florida at the moment.  My interests are varied: I love writing, reading, movies, theater, skiing, hiking, biking, hockey, volleyball, tennis, music (listening and writing/composing) to name a few things. I share your interests in roller-coasters, boating, swimming...have never roller-bladed but want to...I've dreamed of careening recklessly... dangerously on concrete sidewalks and in public parks...  I think Lady and the Tramp would be a fantastic first date! But, it can't be Sunday, as I am flying out to   Omaha that afternoon. I am afraid that I won't be back until Monday evening. Maybe it'll have to be a Sat. matinee?  Well, they're shrieking for me, so I have to finish up here. I hope you have a terrific night...I'll definitely be thinking about you...and wishing I was there.  If you manage to find any time at all, drop me a quick note so when I drag my bruised and battered self home at 11:30...I'll have something to make me smile. You made my night last night & bet you didn't know it.  All my best,  Todd
