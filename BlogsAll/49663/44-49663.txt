my big gay life [27]   Don't laugh. I did go buy a juicer last evening. Ha! Totally love it! Now I might just have a fighting chance at getting the recommended daily amount of fresh fruits and veggies. I retired early to my bedroom...caught up on some reading before drifting off into a blissful sleep. I've been slogging thru  We Were the Mulvaneys  by Joyce Carol Oates. Not a barn-burner...but beautifully written, to be sure. I'm enjoying it for many reasons...that it takes place in the Chautauqua Valley in New York (a place I love), it deals with a semi-rural farming community not too different from where I was born and raised...and that it's an extremely thoughful piece. It's also one of those  Oprah's Book Club  selections...now  THAT'S     gay   ! I'm looking forward to reading a few of the books I received for my birthday...several of which are books I've wanted from my Amazon wishlist. Fortunately, I have family members who are internet-literate enough to make purchases via Amazon. Until last year, many of my family members (who shall remain nameless) were using an abacus...so we've pulled them kicking and screaming into the late 20th Century...hopefully we'll get them into the 21st here pretty soon. What else? After a great night's sleep, I took a long, hot shower, readied for work, played with my pooch Toby and clocked-in at 9:30. So, all is good...not necessarily fabulously exciting or entertaining...but good.
