From  Internet Studies: Weblogging 101  For those of you who may be new to weblogging...or "blogging" as we call it, here are a few tips which will help you not look and sound  completely  silly when discussing the topic: The term " blog " comes from web+log = weblog, minus the prefix "we" = blog. Got it?!  A weblog is posted to the website in reverse chronological order, with the most recent posting on top. SO, if something is not immediately clear...read on...most likely all of your questions will have been answered in earlier posts. Blogging is just like journaling. We bloggers jot down random thoughts, opinions, poems and other mental detritus as it occurs to us. Thus, the writing may, at times, seem disjointed...random...and/or insane. This is normal. This is called "creative writing." Try it sometime, you may like it.  Yes , we bloggers are, in fact, aware that our writings are  immediately accessible  to readers  worldwide . No, this does not bother us. If sharing something personal makes me uncomfortable, then I don't share it. So, anything I post is usually a topic I'd have no problem discussing openly with you, or my own mother. Blogging is increasing in popularity daily. When I started in August, there were merely 20,000 of us using Blogger. Now, there are well over 90,000 folks all over the globe doing this. We've (as a community) received press and praise from major news organizations including, but not limited to,  The New York Times, The Washington Post  and  The Times of London ...not to mention,  The National Enquirer . So, hopefully, this answers a few questions. As always, feel free to email me using the link on the front page of my site, or click   here .
