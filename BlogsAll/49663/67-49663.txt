drive   Yesterday, there was church. And after, a leisurely coffee outside    Civilization   facing Lincoln Park. With my friends Brooke, Kelly,   Steve  and Lee, we discussed the week, the other incidental facts swept under the carpet...unimportant details which paled. We laughed, I made sure of that. At every moment possible, we laughed and we released. Lincoln Park has never looked to beautiful, so inviting, sun-dappled and velvet green. On any other day, an ordinary urban park, any other week...just a gathering place for the random human rubble: drug addicts and homeless. But, everyone here was, in fact, alive. Breathing. Warm. Away from the horror, choking dust and devastation. Here, we have only the tragedies of our own daily lives, each and every one of us. We lick our wounds, hoping the pain subsides. We try for the mute button. We search for beautiful pictures. We find neither. In searching, we are alive.    Last evening, after a large family gathering...with plentiful food, gifts and fellowship, I found myself driving home in the most beatiful twilight, the sky delicate pinks giving way to dense purple-blues. I left the highway in favor of the rural route through Peninsula, and the Cuyahoga Valley. Facing directly west, I could watch the sky kaleidoscope, and darken slowly. Quietly. For just twenty minutes, I drove through the forests conifer and deciduous, the road a winding ribbon of asphalt through the trees and earth. Alone, under the lush green canopy, I was alive. I was safe. I was finally able to let it go...a little. I rolled the windows down to feel the air, to taste it. To breathe.    And when it was completely dark, I went home...to the quiet routine of Sunday evenings. As I curled up on the couch, I wished I could share this blissful peace with everyone who would not know this kind of serenity for a very long time. I was thankful. I was humbled.     Namaste ... I bow to the Divine in you...
