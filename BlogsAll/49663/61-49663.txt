Welcome to the Parkview Nite Club   If you head west on Detroit Avenue on Ohio City, just west of Downtown Cleveland, you'll feel the heat from W.58th Street long before you get there. Those blues manage to find their way all the way up the block from the club. If you were driving on Detroit, you'd take a right on 58th toward Erie, toward the bluff that looks over the shoreway and the city, and the Great Lake beyond. You'd pass the Zone Car, a popular watering hole with cops. Just north of the Zone Car, and sitting on the corner, is the Parkview. It's one of those old, bluecollar joints that's been around forever...well, at least since the 50's. Inside, imagine the most eclectic group of people...shiftworkers, musicians, business types and dockworkers. You'd notice the array of neon signs, sports parephenalia, odd bits of taxidermy and black and white pics of B-movie stars. Last night, Kelly meandered toward the back of the bar to grab seats close to the makeshift stage...which is located in front of the  Roller-Bowler  machine and to the side of the pool table. Augie and his band  Walkin' Cane  were headlining last night. They're amazingly talented...he even gave us both their brand-new CD  Radio Cafe . Bonus! We both tossed back an ice-cold Rolling Rock (or two) and settled for an evening of Blues Jam. We saw a total of 4 different bands over the course of the night...most notably one that featured an 8-year old bass guitarist...who was incredible! By 12:30, we headed back out into the sweltering heat and humidity...looking forward to our air conditioned bedrooms...
