my big gay life [18]   Sorry it's been so long since posting, but with Blogger having tech. problems, it couldn't be avoided. I hope I can remember everything. Let's see...closed the show this weekend (finally), spent many productive hours in-studio with Doug working on new material, spent Mother's Day with Mom and Grandma out at the Homestead. We did the yearly planting/gardening/landscaping in the gorgeous clear spring weather. In the afternoon, Mom took me up to Newman Outfitters to poke around for birthday gift ideas for yours truly. I turn 30 next Sunday. Ack! Ack! Ack! Anyhow, while we were walking around the store...which is incredible, by the way (it has a testing/training pool for kayaks in the middle, a 25-ft. rock climbing tower and tons of other cool displays) we happened upon a  very  friendly and  very  hunky sales associate. He was chatting with me about how he goes backpacking and camping with his dog (a Golden Retriever, no doubt) and acting as guide & leader on some of the store-sponsored expeditions. Sign me up! When I got my mother's attention, I told her that   he   was what I wanted for my birthday...  In other news, my ex Joe sent yet another email. I finally had to tell him to buzz-off permanently...that I didn't want to pursue a friendship...blah blah blah. How irritating. I am looking forward to the weekend because Trish is coming in from Philly to help me celebrate my birthday. Then, on Monday, I fly out to NYC for work related meetings. So, it's going to be a busy and fun couple of weeks ahead.
