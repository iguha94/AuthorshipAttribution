Let's see...lots of little stuff going on. First off, my housemate and soul-sister for the past four years (Kelly) bought a house and will be moving at the end of December. So, I have a lot of mixed feelings...I am really excited for her, but I'm going to miss having her around. There's nothing better than having a great housemate or roommate. So, I look toward January and being alone for the first time in four years. I'm sure there are may things I'll really love about it, but it's hard to see from this vantage point.   Getting ready for the holidays always seems so laborious, so this year, I'm taking time off from work and I'm going to have fun instead of rushing around. I'm planning to deck my halls on Friday. Phil and I have decided to take a road trip up to Toronto for New Years. We'll be staying downtown and partying for 3 days...which should be fun. However, I'll come home to an empty house....don't get me started. So, I'm thinking about having a mid-January party...something to look forward to after the holidays have passed. Will you come? You are invited...Anyone who bothers to read this is graciously invited. Just drop me an email and I'll send you the details when I have 'em.   While I was visiting Williamsburg (I'll post photos soon) with Trish, my dog Toby developed some wanderlust and ended up being picked-up by a nice couple over in Cleveland Heights. As it turns out, he'd only wandered about a block and a half away, still...my friend Margaret (the dogsitter) felt awful. But, Toby's like his dad and loves to check stuff out!! He's home safe and warm now after an afternoon in a household with 2 gregarious golden retrievers. He hates well-groomed, pretty dogs...they pull focus from him. He hates being upstaged...just like his dad.
