Yesterday turned out to be much more interesting than planned. I was doing some valid research on the state of mullet haircuts in today's society when, out of nowhere, this guy from AOL starts chatting me up. Okay - no big deal, right? So, we're chatting and I'm, of course, still doing my mullet research and everything is fine until, BANG! he wants to introduce me to his boyfriend of 3 years and would I mind coming over and "getting to know" both of them. "HA!" I said. If it isn't enough already that I'm flirting with half of the city, but the boys who want to sleep with me are already paired-off. Anyway, I declined the kind offer and returned to my work. THEN something REALLY special happened: my Director from TWILIGHT OF THE GOLDS called me with some very hush-hush information. She had learned thru various sources that I received top honors at the OCTA Festival last week. I was named "Best Actor" for the entire hoo-ha!  Can you believe it?!?! I was absolutely overwhelmed and honored...I really had no inkling that our show would win ANYTHING. Then, to top it off, Vonnie also received the top honor for her portrayal of "Phyllis" (my mother in the show). So, we scored big TWICE! After all that schlepping and bitching about being in Toledo, we go and do THIS. Anyway, it is supposed to be a surprise when we are officially recognized on Monday evening. But, I had to tell someone.
