Feeling a little woozy. I like the word woozy. Anyhow, I'm fighting this drainy-coldy thing which appeared out of nowhere yesterday. So, let's recap the weekend, shall we?   Friday   As mentioned in MBGL 53, Friday evening was lovely...complete with excellent company and fresh Maine lobster. However, I am beginning to think that this is where I picked-up my current cold bug. Phil was a little sniffly that evening, now that I look back.    Saturday   The show with Grandma was wonderful. The whole fam then had a nice dinner out, which is also unusual for Gran. Normally, she just likes to scoot straight home. However, on Saturday, we enjoyed a nice leisurely meal together before heading home. I met up with Kelly, we watched a few hours of the benefit concert, and then headed out to  Touch Supperclub,  just a few blocks away in our neighborhood. Touch was featuring a live salsa band and dancing. Kelly looked tres fabulous in her brand-spankin'-new outfit...very sexy! We ran into a couple of friends, John and Arlene. Arlene is married to a very close childhood friend Roy, who also happens to be an extremely gifted artist. Kelly and I spent the remainder of the night and early morning with John and Arlene before heading home.   Sunday   First, there was church. Then, I raced home to pick-up Toby and head over to Phil's where I was housesitting last night. After spending a few hours with his dog Rusty, I took Toby over to my parents' for a leisurely evening at home. We grilled Talapia and watched movies as the weather turned miserable. I drove back to Phil's in a torrential downpour and hit the hay early. I had to leave Phil's by 7:30 this morning in order to make it back into the city on time.   So, that's the weekend. Today, we're having a Marketing Dept. lunch in honor of Rachel's 30th at Sans Souci. That's it for the update. More later...
