my big gay life [20]   My life just gets  bigger  and  gayer  by the minute. Last week, I went to that baseball game I was telling you about, and afterwards, we went to the Leather Stallion for drinks, right? Well, I didn't mention that I met a friend/classmate of Lee's (ex-love-of-life) from Podiatry School. So, this guy, we'll call him Red, gets real chatty with me. Now, understand that we're sitting out on the beautiful patio and that I'm pleasantly buzzed...and not really paying attention to a thing he's saying. I just get the feeling he's way more interested in me than I am in him. After enjoying my blissful-floaty feeling for awhile, I get up and take my leave...but not before he hands me a card with his name, number and address scribbled on it.  Whatever ,   not interested  . So, today I get a phone call from my best friend, Phil (who knows Red casually) who informs me that Red is totally Jonesing for the Todd, and wants to pursue it. Oy. Not wanted, not needed. So now, I have this guy interested...and I want no part of it. Sometimes I hate that about the universe...you're ready for someone to be interested, except for the person that is.   So, I attended the second night of auditions for  Chicago  last night. Lots of new faces and some really talented folks. I swear, there was only one other gay guy in the whole bunch. Callbacks are this evening, so it's going to get interesting. Also wrestling with the idea of auditioning myself...they need a Billy, and I could do it...but I'd have to resign as Co-Producer. Anyhow, it's funky no matter which way you slice it.
