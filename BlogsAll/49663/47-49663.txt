unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 22  March 13   Hey there back,  Just got back from lunch - which was good had a Streak Sandwich at J  Alexander's , and what was waiting for me when I returned?? Yes.. one of  those wonderful things that download to my email program. Woohoo...  although I'm imagining you caught in a Disney Hurricane.. Si and Am  clinging for their life by their clutching tails as they spin around..  Nala, Simba, and Mafusa whipped about confused they did the wrong dance  (had to do a little research on Lion King characters) .. oh well..  hopefully you are keeping your ground and will get all your p's and q''s in  order by 3pm. I'm glad you'll come Thursday.. I kinda all ready made your plans and said  I'll be bringing another Todd. Sort of funny, my friends name is Todd, and  there's another Tod we know too, Plus a Jerry and another Jerry, and of  course a Me and another Dan (although he is Dano) - Dano is MIA - somewhere  in GA. He'll be back by Saturday.. as we have some films to see at the Film  Festival.. you of course will be working.. but maybe catch up with you  sometime after for a drink?? We'll see. So on Thursday we'll pick up my  friend Tommy then off to Todd's in North Ridgeville. As long as you are at  my place by 7pm, that will be great.. that should answer the time and  place. Come earlier if you like. I don't and hope you don't feel I'm being  presumptuous about making plans for you.. but I think you'd enjoy and have  a good time. I like you and at least would love you as a friend.. more to  come slowly. I feel comfortable with you and I DO think your attractive  too, just don't want to jump into anything fast. You not only make me  smile, but also blush, not to mention you do give me warm fuzzies.  XOXOXOXO Dan
