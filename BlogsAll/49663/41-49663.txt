Well, summer has finally arrived in Cleveland...temperatures soaring into the 90's and blazing sunshine. We're usually there by mid-May. The temperature of Lake Erie is typically 72 degrees by now, is still hovering at a chilly, hypothermia-inducing 57 degrees...so there's some catch-up that has to happen before any of us plan on going swimming, windsurfing or waterskiing without a wetsuit. When I worked at Sea World, I think we kept the water chilled to 58 degrees for the whales, dolphins and sea lions' optimum comfort...and we all definitely had to use wetsuits then. Last night I had a rehearsal for Chicago. We worked on the chroeography for  All I Care About Is Love  which looks like it's going to be a great number! I was so happy to discover that my vocal distress is almost gone, and I am once again nailing everything in my mid & upper range. I keep drinking lots of ginger tea which causes lots of sinus relief and drainage...I feel pretty clear for the first time in weeks. On a sadder note, my friend & surrogate brother, David Kammerman, lost his mother this week, quite suddenly...she apparently had some major malfunction with her spleen. I have memorial services for her tomorrow. My friend Sally Suren just lost her sister Pat yesterday after a courageous battle with cancer. While expected and prepared for, it is never easy. I have services for Pat on Saturday and Sunday. As for the rest of you...behave, treat each other well, love each other a little more, and take time to acknowledge the abundance in your lives...count every single blessing...
