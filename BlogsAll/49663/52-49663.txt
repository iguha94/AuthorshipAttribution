my big gay life (43)   I had to take a bit of a break after the posting-frenzy on Monday. I just wanted to button-up the whole  unravel in 58  series. [note:  tongue planted firmly in cheek ] Whilst certain folk grew nauseated, rolled-eyes and gnashed teeth at the thought of slogging through all that syrupy-sappy text,   Andrew  suggested sticking the reams of text on a separate page as its own thingy...and still other folks like   Charlie  couldn't wait to delve further into my former misery. In fact, my favorite bit of feedback is from Charlie who said, and I quote, "Thanks for sharing all of that, I hope it gave you some perspective and opened you up for whatever's next. " Or better yet, "That boy wasn't smart enough for you. There you were putting your feelings down in words he didn't deserve and he was giving you back a watered-down version of what he thought he might be feeling. And apparently his "feelings" don't come with spellcheck." I almost fell off my chair laughing. Thanks to Charlie for making my week!! I have designated him as my  Official NYC Boyfriend , to whom I will be monogamously committed-to whilst ever on the isle of Manhattan.    In other news...I am going to see Stevie Nicks tonight out at Blossom Music Center. My friend Kevin gave me VIP backstage passes and backstage parking, so Kelly and I are in for an incredible night. Now all I have to do is find some fringy shawls and date Joe Cocker.
