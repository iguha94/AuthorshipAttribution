my big gay life (53)    I'm kinda sorry that  The Music Man  will be picking up and leaving town tomorrow. Usually, I don't care too much one way or another...and many times I yell  GOOD RIDDANCE ! But somehow, this show and the wonderful people in it have managed to have a good effect on me. I'm actually going to miss them.  Shoot!  The performance this afternoon was terrific & Grandma loved the whole thing - she even talked about wanting to come down to the theatre again in December to see the Radio City Christmas show starring the Rockettes. This is a big deal because she hasn't wanted to make the trip to the theatre in a few years. After all, she's 94 years old. However, when she's feeling up to it, she loves to go downtown...so I guess we'll come back to see the Rockettes.     Last evening was really nice out at Phil's. Spending time with him and our friends Chris and Jim is always wonderful. The lobsters were delicious, the wine incredible and the conversation as hilarious as always. As it gets to be Autumn, I love to sit inside around the fireplace in the evenings with friends, telling stories, drinking wine and relaxing. I miss being outside, and I've managed to miss the Night Bike scheduled for this evening with hottie Ranger Doug from the National Park Service. Ah well...I'll have to catch him some other time. In the meanwhile, I have enough on my plate to keep me quite busy.     Kelly and I are going to check out this benefit concert thingie on tonight, then probably head out for a little partying. Hope you all have terrific Saturdays!!
