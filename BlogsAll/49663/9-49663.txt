Good Morning Darling,  I haven't called or written anything and the week is escaping quickly. I have to take a moment to try to put into words how thankful, grateful and blessed both Dad and I have felt a million times over this week for your wonderful hand in our lives.  The Christmas tree stands in the corner looking absolutely beautiful and reminds us of the  time and the talent you shared with us last Sunday.   The tree is beautiful and your involvement with its selection, and ultimate completion made everything work smoothly for your Dad and me.   We really have been on a very fast track these past few weeks and as you know an emotional roller coaster for much longer than that.  Having that tree all done, and done SO beautifully has given us a lift honey that is almost spiritual!    You came in and filled a VERY big need that even we didn't know for sure that we had.  We continue to run faster and faster through each day. Most of the time barley having time to do anything but the most necessary things  for ourselves but every now and then we spy the tree and are beautifully reminded of your easy, loving manner and gifts.  All I can say in words is "Thank You"   however  in my heart is this huge, never ending  love and joy that God sent you to us.   When I think of Christmas and all the meaning that it has for me and all the love that the world is enfolded in I think of you.   You live, and share  God's Love every moment of your life  and we are blessed!!!!    We love you!                                                    mom and dad
