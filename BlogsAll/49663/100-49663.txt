from the boy who lives here...     Winter finally arrived today with the first bona fide snowstorm. It was not legendary in size or scope, but it was beautiful...especially since I haven't seen much snow at all. Except for Weather Channel shots of Buffalo. I conjured thoughts of skiing...snapping by boots into the bindings of my Elan skis and hitting the slopes. One of the things I love about skiing is the absolute serenity of it. Outside of the ride up the mountain on the lift, it's a relatively solitary sport. This is definitely something I have to look forward to...    I laugh remembering learning to ski. I might not have ever left the bunny hills without the cajoling of my seventh-grade best friend Charles Kaake...who always pushed me to do more, better and go further. I wonder what ever happened to him. I know he moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana. After that, who knows.     I spent today with Kelly, doing some after Xmas gift certificate shopping. We hit Borders, Bed Bath & Beyond, Gap and the grocery store. It was fun just being together...doing regular stuff. It was our first outing together since she moved, and it was heartening to know that it's still just as fabulous spending time spending money.     Bring the pain...     I'm sorry guys, but I'm going to have to refuse your offers of courtship. The Todd is taking a dating hiatus. It's so funny, because when it rains...well, you know. Here in Cleveland, things can look a little bleak on the dating landscape. However, as is always the case, as soon as I declare "hiatus" boys come scrambling out of the woodwork trying to woo me. Where ya been, boys? Well, I appreciate the attention and effort, guys...but I'm gonna stick to my guns. Not that y'all aren't handsome and adorable and smart and sexy... (timing is everything)     Next...
