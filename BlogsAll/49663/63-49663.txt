my big gay life (50)    Threesome   Everything happens in three's, right? It must have been the full moon on Aug. 4th. It  musta . I knew something weird was going down in my universe. First, I get a voicemail from my long-lost first love, Lee. He's now living with his partner in Miami, Florida. I haven't spoken to him since November, I think, which is merely a lapse in emailing/calling. So, I was very happy to get back in touch. Then, I turn on the television last night and see that a certain minor musical celebrity is back in town hawking his new CD on the old PBS channel...could that explain the flurry of "Private" calls on my caller ID.  Weird . Then, when I return from my show last night, Neighbor Thomas is sitting on my side porch with Miss Kelly. Apparently, he just showed-up last night for Sex And The City & QAF...which is great that he feels so comfortable coming on over. We watched the QAF repeat & then he went home to crash. As I thought about the whole day, I couldn't help but chuckle. I mean, no big deal, right?! But still, 3 in one day makes for an eyebrow-raising moment. And, I had this dream this morning right before I woke up. In it, I was driving my car and I got into an accident...and I could see the whole thing happening and it wasn't scary and I knew I'd be okay. So, the accident happened, and I got out of the car unscathed. Dream analysis says that auto accidents mean the return of something lost or out of touch. Huh!?  Interesting...
