unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 5 , March 5   hmmm Todd... whole bunch of trouble could happen with lights out, but I  agree only the BEST sort of trouble. And thanks for the compliment.. I  think your cute too - and how close are we? I'm on Franklin and West X3rd?  I work in Lyndhurst, roads are fine at this hour.. it's just cold  outside... and if by chance you get snowed in on the east side.. put some  candles in your glove box... I may not make it to you to keep you warm ;)  And feel free to ask anything... communication is key to anything. I like  your humor too... sounding cuter with every E.. what are you doing right  now? I'm writing you obviously and listening to some dance music I borrowed  on Napster... do you know how I give it back... so confusing....  ;) Actually I'm gonna be bummed when they shut it down, I won't be able to  get all this great music. Anyway.. have a good day if I don't get to hear  back like by 3:45pm... ;)  Later, Dan  p.s. you have any more pictures?

Where to begin... only the BEST sort of trouble ;) I like the email from work thingy, too...especially since it's from a cute neighbor!! We just had a power-outage here a few mins. ago...I thought we were having rolling blackouts like Northern California...but it was just CPP screwing around. But, it did get kinda chilly...brrrr!! Where on the east side do you work? Will my drive to Chagrin tonight be hellacious? Will I arrive safely? Will I ever stop asking inane questions? :)
