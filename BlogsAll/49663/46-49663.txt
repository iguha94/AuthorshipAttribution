unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 26  March 14    Hey Todd, How's your day going??? Still crazy? Anything exciting, have a good lunch? where'd ya go? I had a French bread pizza and a yogart. Whatcha doing tonight? Not sure here.. have to return that movie, buy tickets for the film festival, and prolly work out too. Uneventful here, although sort of noisy, I'm getting a new roof today. Scuba class was fun, although got quite workout, had to swim 12 laps non stop, the tread water for 15 min. Then we donned our gear, masks, fins and snorkel and learned some moves... They just need to light the squares at the bottom of the pool, so I can be John Travolta. Like to trip the light fantastic with me? Do you dance? Would be fun to go out and dance with you sometime. So you still have some questions unanswered from previous emails, you mentioned your writing on the way back from Omaha, but didn't say what it was or about. Well, your probably busy... but I'm still very interested. I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow night. I really love to hear form you.. write me :)  patiently waiting to hear from you,  Dan    09:59 AM 3/14/01 -0500, you wrote: Hi Dan! I did get your message, but thought it probably was too late to call you. I imagined you were curled up with at least one kitty out in dreamland. I am so glad to hear you got a 4th for scuba class! It sounded like you got home late, too. I had to go pick-up Toby from the parents' out in Aurora. In the meanwhile, it's chaos and mayhem revolving around our Disney announcement yesterday...lotsa news coverage and lotsa phone calls coming in. I have a lunch scheduled today, otherwise I would have loved to have met you. :)   xoxo Todd
