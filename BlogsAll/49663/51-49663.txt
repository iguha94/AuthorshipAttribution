my big gay life (45)     life is a plum...    Anyone who lived in Cleveland during this city's greatest streak of insecurity will be familiar with the "failed BIG like the Titanic failed BIG" city motto/catchphrase:  If New York's an Apple, Cleveland's a Plum! . So...Cleveland's a  plum ?!?! Anyway, I was thinking about that this evening as Neighbor Thomas presented me with the gift of a home-grown plum...only the second piece of fruit off of his plum (tree?) (bush?). I thought the gesture was quite sweet. Let me give you a little background on Thomas. He arrived in the neighborhood two years ago as the first set of townhouses went up across the street from my house in what was once a fallow field. And even though I appreciate the major leap in home value the project added to my abode,  I missed seeing the giant belltower of St. Stephen's over on W. 54th. Thomas was one of the first of the five owners to take occupancy. He's always been a wee bit awkward...not necessarily shy...he's got all sorts of opinions, but he's not ultra-social with anyone, it seems.  Sometimes in the past he reminds me of that gopher-thing who, if he sees his own shadow, harkens 6 more weeks of winter. Lately, he's really become a lot more social with Kelly and me...visiting for porch parties and the like. Last weekend, he even came to see  Chicago  with Kelly. So, tonight he stopped over after work and handed me a plum as we chatted about our plans for next week's concert. Sometimes it's the little things. I am struck by life's simplicity. Funny...just now as I am typing, I can hear the bells chiming over at St. Stephen's...and even if I can't see it anymore, at least I can hear those beautiful chimes...Life is good.  Life is a plum.
