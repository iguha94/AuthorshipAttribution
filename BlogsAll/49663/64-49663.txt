Actual conversation I had this weekend, wherein one know-it-all tries to engage another (me) in idle nature prattle.     Did you see that?       What's there to see?      That. It's a Blue Heron .     So .     So, it's magnificent. It's not like you see them all the time.      I do. Every time I visit my parents. There's this, what do you call it?      Call what?      The thing where they nest...it has some name.      Rookery?      Rookery. Right. And there are tons of Herons there...sleeping .     Nesting.      Sleeping.      Nesting . Tons?      Yep. Blue ones .     Really.      Big Blue Herons everywhere, all over the treetops.     Do they just, what? Sit there?      Do birds "sit" ??     You know...in the nest?     Well, and they swoop.     Swoop?     Swoop down from the nest. To get food.     But they eat fish.     Right. They swoop to fish.     Okay. We are not having this conversation.     Sure. Whatever.
