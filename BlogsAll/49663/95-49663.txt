A letter from late January...      Hello Deidra!    Can you forgive me for taking so long to write a freaking email?! Sorry to have been MIA for so long, but things have been a little wacky. In December, my housemate of 4 years bought her own house, so the entire month was spent packing, reorganizing, cleaning and moving her out. This was an enormous task, but more than that, emotionally very difficult. Kelly was sort of my platonic significant other...someone who knew me on a daily basis better than even my own family. Losing her was a huge blow, but good for us both, in the end. I was devastated to lose her, but so proud of her & happy that she had such a wonderful opportunity to go make a home of her own.     So, it forced me to really reorganize my own life and prepare for a new phase, one that has me managing the household by myself...which isn't so bad after all. Kelly and I speak almost daily and get together every week to catch up. So, it's all very strange and wonderful at the same time...making my own house feel new all over again.     So, then it was early January and I began WIZARD OF OZ rehearsals full-tilt with Jill and Phil, plus handling the tours of STOMP and BEST LITTLE WHOREHOUSE. So, I've been way out of touch, to say the least...and I apologize. I have also been cast as Jesus in JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR...and have been having flashbacks to the time I met you...and those are, indeed, happy memories for me.     I guess I could summarize my feelings as conflicted lately...bouncing between feeling sorry for myself and elated, if that makes any sense at all. In any case, that's what's been going on with me and I really do want to catch up with you soon. I love you and miss you and hope to talk to you in short order. Please give my love to Mark...    Much love,  Todd
