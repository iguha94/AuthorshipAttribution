unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 12  March 8  Good morning MR. Todd,  Glad you made it back from Grandmas house, I can just picture you  in the cutest little red hood. Actually, thats very sweet and in fact I  hold my grandmother in very high regard also. She lives in Columbus, so I  don't get to see her as much as I'd like to. I also have a Grandma here  too- on my mothers side. One is Jewish the other is Baptist (Columbus one).  Let's see if I can confuse you.. seem to everyone else... My mother is  Jewish, My real father is Baptist. I have a younger brother, but only half  as he was bagat by my mother and stepfather(who is also Jewish).. he is  Mike.. different last name then me. Then I have a older brother.. call him  step, his name is Dan too.. but was begat by a previous marriage from my  step father. No sisters unless you count Regina and Christy whom were  adopted by my real father from his new wife...on my fathers side... I was  only close with my Grandmother and Aunt( out near Ashtabula). I also have  an Aunt that lives here in Cleveland, my mothers sister, Rachelle - she's  cool.. and thinking about her right now, because I could really use a  massage! She is a licensed massage therapist with knowledge of foot  reflexology. Do you give massages? There could be major bonus points for  you here if you can...I give them  too, pretty good ones too... but will save that for another time. Ok, this  paragraph thought was intended to talk about family... I realized that you  separated your thoughts into nice little organized paragraphs with huge  spaces between them.. and I imagine my emails say BUCKLE UP, your going for  a ride on the head of Dan [name omitted]. I also have an uncle on my mothers side,  he lives in Paris with his wife and their 3 kids. So thats pretty much my  family and newly coming member from my older step brother's wife, Kate..  whom I adore worlds more then him.. is having a baby due in August, so I'll  be an uncle, just found out last night the baby will be a boy! So all those  loud toys.. will be seeked out by me for gifts... especially since they now  live in LA. My little brother is in CT, going to school at Yale, following  his goal to be a concert pianist. Why is a person who plays the piano  called a pianist but a person who drives a race car is not called a racist?  So how about you, tell me a little more about your family So of my family, I am out to my mothers side... Jews seem to  better to deal with things like that then Baptists.. plus they are not as  involved in my life now. I also came out when I was 17, at 18 - formed  PRYSM with a few other youth and facilitation of the center., birthdate Jan  16,1989. I know your younger then me, so did you not know about it or not  in the Cleveland area at that time? Did you grow up here? If not what  brought you to C-Town? My family is very cool with me being gay, and have  even brought Bf's to family dinner functions. Are you out to your family? Would you believe I have not seen Lady And The Tramp.. would ya  like to watch it again sometime with me? Actaully I've never been much of a  Disney fan, I don't think I've even sat through a whole Disney Annimated  movie since Bambi on big screen when I was little, aside from Toy Story,  and my favorite character is the 3-eyed alien , which resides on my car  dashboard.. your favorite part. Oh and by the way... I have located on the  web a warehouse of car dashboards, unfortunately they are all Yugo brand...  guess they had no where to go? Yea, Uncle Sam with tits, just doesn't work... you'd imagine a  Drag Queen would have done that as Aunt Sam(antha). The IRS, isn't one of  my favorite agencies though... I actually contemplated peeing on the IRS  building when I was in DC.. I had to go REAL BAD, when I was in town for  the March On Washington. At least I would have felt better for paying what  I did last year.. ugh..actually the trip to DC, was fun... not necessarily  for the whole Gay thing.. however an experience if you've never been.. but  mainly to get together with my friends who have moved from this fair and  fine city. Stayed with my friend David, and my other friends joined from  NYC, and Philly. The highlight was truly the HRC Equality Rocks Concert...  2nd favorite concert to date. It featured Pet Shop Boys, George Michael, KD  Lang, Mellissa Etheridge, Garth Brooks, many more and many presenters as  Kathy Nijimy, Tipper Gore, Kiristen Johnson, to name a few.. It really was  an incredible time. Well, I do want to thank you for writing me, a complete pleasure  to see an email from you first thing...you all ready have brightened my  day. Have a great day yourself.. if your not dragging ass.. get some  coffee... mm coffee.. sounds good, think I will do the same... make a pot  of Gevalia coffee..mmmm.. Have a good bit of work in front of me to do..  and still need to jump in the shower... then hosting a small get together  later, my friends and I take turns hosting Will and Grace night, including  dinner.. very good time. So, I will let you get some work done, although I  have a feeling.. you could just read on and on, like nearing an end of a  movie so good.. you don't want it to end... drop me a email when you get a  chance... is the next hour good for you??? Hey, I enjoy hearing from you  just as much!!  Captivated, Dan     At 01:12 AM 3/8/01 -0500, you wrote: Dear Dan,    Imagine my abject horror upon receiving the error message after thoughtfully completing such a gorgeous message...filled with humor, whimsy, wit and relentless charm. I wrote and wrote, and then wrote again some more. It's lost forever. However: Here I Am. Writing you at a quarter to One. Look at me! I am writing this while enduring the excruciating pain of a paper cut on my left middle finger. Ow! With every peck at the keyboard...wincing...every keystroke sending me reeling into seething pain. Okay, so I exaggerate.        I drove out east to visit with my grandmother...she's 93. We're very close...she helped raise me. I try to have dinner, or see her at least once weekly & call her every day. She's my favorite person on the planet. Then I raced out to Chagrin to do more grueling rehearsal. All the special effects seem to be in place tonight, and everything went off without a hitch. Now, if I can just remember my lines... ;)        I was glad to note that your emailing priorities are, in fact, intact. Numero uno on your to-do list is quite flattering. The truth is, I love writing to you, and even more...anticipating your response. Your emails are thoroughly entertaining & I do enjoy reading them and laughing out loud. You're right, I do smile when I see your name pop up in my In Box. I fear the people in cube-land around me must think I am mental...laughing at my screen.        Sorry to hear about the Uncle Sam situation...and thanks so much for the image of his tits which is now etched permanently in my mind's eye. I'm ruined.        Do you have a cold?        I'm sorry your ears were not burning. I could do a little experiment right now:    "Dan, Dan, Dan...blah blah Dan blah blah blah Dan."    Did it work? Did your ears burn?        I deserved those Sade tickets. They were rightfully mine. Too bad you had to it back with the riff-raff. I used my extra seat as a convenient place to store my keg. Nah, it remained empty. Had I known you were back there...        I had no idea you were involved with PRYSM. I wish I had something like PRYSM when I came out at 17 (late by today's standards, but still). How terrific! You should be proud!        Okay, about the whole Taurus thing...    it's true I can be stubborn, but not too much..and with that Gemini cusp thingy going on...I don't have a real sense of where I am astrologically. I find astrology very intriguing. So, Miss Cleo, if I give you my time and place of birth, you'll whip up a chart for me? ;) Interesting that you can guess someone's sign 75% of the time. Did you guess mine? I guessed you were an Aquarian.   Big Disney fan? Hmmm..depends. I had such a heinous experience with the tour of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST that the mere mention of the D-word made me twitch. After much therapy, I seem to be okay. It's just that...I loved "Lady and the Tramp" when I was little, and the Siamese cats were my favorite characters.        Yes, your email definitely made my day...and I hope mine manages to make you smile. I hope you had a wonderful evening, pleasant dreams and a great new day (as you read this).   Yours,  Todd
