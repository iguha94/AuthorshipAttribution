Tongue planted firmly in cheek.   Do you know that that we gay folk are not allowed to donate blood? Well, that's if you answer the questions truthfully. Do you  know that we are not welcome to openly serve in the U.S. armed forces? I ask you,  what are the homosexuals supposed to do in this crisis? Our assistance is  not welcomed in those two sectors, so I say we support in the way we know  best: consumption. We gays can help stabilize the economy. We have the opportunity, nay,  duty  to assist our country in any and every way possible. Even if it means shopping in a mall with an Orange Julius. So, I have urged  every queen I know armed with a couple of credit cards to get out and hit  the malls, restaurants and upscale boutiques. We may not be able to assist  with the victims of the Pentagon crash and WTC collapse, but we can perform  triage on the nation's economy. We, the poofters, can singularly bolster the  US's soft economy. Who else knows how to shop and consume like we do? I say: No  One! Do your civic duty! I send you out in search of commercial fabulousity.  So, I say: "Go forth, girls, and CHARGE! On Visa, on MasterCard and Diner's Club...on Amex, platinum, gold and Blue!" Strengthen the USA at her core! Do it for Uncle Sam...and while you're at it...somebody get him a new outfit...
