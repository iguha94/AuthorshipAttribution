unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 11  March 7    OH NO!.. you have really bummmed me out... theres nothing worse then losing  something that has been written, it just doesn't come out the same way  twice. So now I will wonder what words I have missed.. lost in the world of  electric pulses of 0's and 1's. Do you have any idea how rare it is for me  to receive a Fantastically Entertaining Email these days? I'm in complete  despair without a person to complain to.. oh wait.. I DO.. the creator of  the Internet - Al Gore! OHHH AHHHHLL. Actually their was a wonderful  advertisement I received at work one day.. top part had a picture had the  USA of what represented the internet network.. underneath, The Internet has  been proudly brought to you by Al Gore, the bottom half, a picture of the  Moon.. and the Moon and underneath is said the Moon has been proudly  brought to you by Network Solutions. Very funny... oh well.. maybe I get an  extra long email if the sandman isn't enticing you to a good night in  bed... have a good night, sweet dreams...  Mr. [name omitted] is lost until he hears from you again... dramatic shake of the  head looking into the sky sighing.. oh god thats GAY.

DAMN DAMN DAMN! I'm going to have to respond later tonight when I get home. Right now I have to scoot out to a dinner date with Grandma in Mayfield Heights, of all places. It was GREAT talking to you & getting your email. I will write back later...  UGH!  Best, Todd
