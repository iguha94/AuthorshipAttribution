Just under the wire! I was hoping to post today - you know how I hate skipping. Anyway, I received a few interesting emails in the past 24 hours that induced some pondering. Two were from an old flame, Eden, who was just saying hello...chatting about the imminent return of his boyfriend from being at sea and how he felt nervous about it and wasn't sure why. When I started to ask questions, he got a little defensive, but asked if he could call me later this week. This is a milestone, of course, because Eden is the worst "keeper in toucher" in the world.  The other email was from an even older flame, the ex love of my life, Lee. He's finally feeling settled in Miami and liking his new hospital. He's now on rotations and that crazy hospital/doctor schedule they put you on for a few years. He also announced he is now dating someone wonderful. Which, makes me both happy for him and wistful at the same time. It's always hard to hear about the love of your life falling in love with someone else. And, I know, you might say well...Todd, you're so busy all the time flirting and meeting people, what does it matter? And you'd be right. It doesn't matter much, but I believe in feeling how I'm feeling at any given moment and not denying it.  I am certain I'm due for love again soon - as long as it doesn't come in the form of my last few exes. I'm off to Toledo tomorrow and Sunday to compete in the State Finals for Theatre. I will be performing two scenes from THE TWILIGHT OF THE GOLDS. Wish me and us luck. God, I really don't want to go to Toledo. Yuck.
