unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 15  March 9    From: Dan  Subject: Re: beautiful new day  Date: March 9, 2001 11:53:51 AM EST    Todd,         Did you see what I did out my window??? Not beautiful to me, I'm over this white stuff, bring me warmth, sun...and wouldn't it just happen to be, the first night I don't put my car in the garage, it snows... all the other days it's in the garage.. nothing..grrrr... although it did become a beautiful day with the woohoo you got mail message I received in my IN Box from you :)          It was just a small group of 4 of us last night, watched the show I taped from Wednesday night, Some Of My Best Friends.. a new gay show on CBS, a spin off from the movie Kiss Me Guido. Then watched an episode of SPACE 1999 (borrowed DVD set), remember that?.. wow, so funny to watch them now. I got Pizza from Angelo's ..mmm very good and washed it down with rootbeer.. something about pizza and rootbeer..or even a real cold..... Are you a Coke or Pepsi boy? Then watched the repeat of Will and Grace, it was the Cher episode. I'm ready for new one now...I've only had the opportunity to catch Queer As Folk on occasion, but have seen some episodes - I wasn't to thrilled with it at first.. but I think I can appreciate it for what it's worth, however some of the characters I just don't like. I did decide to get the British version on DVD, however when it came.. it was made in a different color system and region.. so it wouldn't play on my DVD player.. needless to say I had to send them back.. I better get a full refund! Although the boxed set of Absolutely Fabulous is to be out on DVD soon.. I must get that, even though I own all the videos. Do you have DVD yet? Well all in all we had a great time, laughed our asses off about planning a practical joke on a friend of ours.         So now back to your previous email in which I have not completely finished responding to... didn't get to all your interests.. was I in there?? I see you love reading and writing (of which you do very nicely - and expressive also with a sense of humor that comes out). Do you write more then just to me? Are you writing some wonderful and interesting novel? I've been told I should .. but I can only imagine sending the reader to say, whoa.. I need to go back.. that ride was just like the Millennium Force.. of which I've rode 3 times all ready.. once at night. ROLLER COASTER, SCARY OR EXCITING? What do you enjoy reading, besides my emails of course?..WHAT BOOK ARE YOU READING NOW? FAVORITE AUTHOR? I just finished Armisted Maupin's The Night Listener, before that David Sedaris, Me Talk Pretty - very funny, I like his humor and style of writing. I still need to get Barrel Fever, I have the others. I just recently bought Christopher Rice's Density of Soul's, and on the second chapter. He's the son of Ann Rice, and he's gay..shhh. So far my favorite author is Armisted Maupin, from his six book novel of Tales Of The City, I was hooked on him and have bought and read everything. I also own the videos of Tales Of The City.. ever see it? He did More Tales Of The City.. but I don't care for some of the replaced characters. Ok, the movie topic.. thats definitely an in person long depth discussion there. I love movies.. from some popular Hollywood, to independents, to foreign - comedies, dramas, sci fi (although not into the whole Trekkie thing - not that it's bad), also other genres of movies..although not a big horror or documentary fan.WHAT IS YOUR MOST DISLIKED ACTOR? mine is Jim Carrey. I have my movies all ready picked out for the film festival, do you go? Been to any movies at the Cleveland Cinematheque? I also subscribe to Hot Tickets, which I get to see preview screenings of movies before they hit the theatre..perhaps you'll be a future date to one.Moving right along, theatre, yep love that too.. biking, very good... perhaps some biking together too.. love the trails at the tow path, ever been?..most of the time I will bike to Edgewater park (and not to cruise), down the hill and back up..huffing and puffing and into Lakewood and back.. and also sometimes to Rocky River Reservation. Hockey is actually fun to watch, went to a Jacks game a couple years ago.. suppose to go again with another friend. Volleyball is fun too - never got into tennis and golfing... (I know golfing isn't one you mentioned - but added it for me) Actually the one chance I had to golf was with my brothers in Palm Springs when we were all there for a convention (Entrepreneur Of The Year Award - we didn't win for National) They played golf, I decided it was SPA day.. massage, pool, sunning, steam and dry sauna, annihilation room...much more relaxing then looking like a fool on the green! I think you'd agree. Music, enjoy that too... and have a feeling we may have more in common then just Sade. Although the composing music has eyebrow raised of interest..Also excited you also share my interests as well.. I love to try new things, or occasionally do things out of the ordinary like bowling.         So to Omaha, NE... would you believe there is a gay life there.. info here at http://208.249.122.222/travel/invoketravelarticle.cfm?ID=B0A8DBD8-98D6-11D4-A7B700A0C9D84F02&method=guidefulldisplay - if your interested. Ft Lauderdale will be much better to go to.. I wanna go with! I was just there for my birthday and in Miami in January, celebrated my 30th.. and I had a good time.. spent it with friends I have there plus saw a slew of Cleveland people there too.         I guess I'm a folk that loves underwear, you know you can buy it all ready worn by hot jocks in some magazines?? I have no underwear fetish.. doesn't really matter to me, although I do think boxerbreifs are a bit sexy...but I agree with you, my interest lies in that of whom it just so happens to be wearing the underwear... but key point.. they do wear something.         Scuba.. at the YMCA (no arm gestures please) downtown, also recently joined, I didn't realize how gay it is either..I thought they all went to Ballys.. anyway, I just go to work out.. So you gave up scuba? :( Are you certified? Does that mean you can't scuba with me in Hawaii??          So what are your plans for Saturday? My friend is having me over dinner Saturday night.. but we could do something in the afternoon if you'd like to, I could rent Lady And the Tramp, drink milk with Si and Am... What kind of milk do you drink? 2%, 1% Fat Free, Whole? Lactose Intolerant?   more questions (limited to 20):  WHAT'S ON YOUR MOUSE PAD? don't have a mouse pad FAVORITE SMELLS?  FAVORITE SOUNDS?  WORST FEELING IN THE WORLD?  WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING?  WHAT IS THE LAST THING YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU GO TO BED? WHAT IS IMPORTANT IN LIFE?  FAVORITE FOODS?  CHOCOLATE OR VANILLA?  DO YOU LIKE TO DRIVE FAST? STORMS - COOL OR SCARY?  DO YOU LIKE RAIN? WILL YOU RUN IT? WHAT TYPE WAS YOUR FIRST CAR?  IF YOU COULD MEET ONE PERSON DEAD OR ALIVE?  FAVORITE ALCOHOLIC DRINK?  IS THE GLASS HALF EMPTY OR HALF FULL? depends on what it's filled with DO YOU TYPE WITH YOUR FINGERS ON THE RIGHT KEYS?  WHAT'S UNDER YOUR BED?  WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE NUMBER?  WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?           Ok, that should keep you busy, lol if your not all ready swamped today.. actually I need to do some things and get some work done myself.. meeting the folks at 1pm for lunch. Awww..Si is sitting here on my lap as I type you.. so cute. Well, I hope your having a great day.. look forward to another one of your wonderful emails. Perhaps we can get together sometime tomorrow, let me know.. otherwise I look forward to sometime next week.  fondly, Dan  ps. not fondling, thats something else.
