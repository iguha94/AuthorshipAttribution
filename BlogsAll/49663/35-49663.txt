unravel in 58    chronicles of a heart undone    email 8 , March 5    Todd, Stalking sure doesn't come without it's disadvantages... my toes  are still cold.. standing in snow waiting in the cold, the wind blowing  through my bones.. I couldn't stay much longer then 10:53pm.. so I guess I  missed you.. but I did manage to set surveillance cameras to see who is  going in and coming out. Your police and credit record check out.. so your  good there.. hey, I'm thorough in everything I do. And your place at 5216  Bridge Ave. is very nice from the outside. HA!.. bet your freaked now... especially if your records are  clean.. at least I'm hoping, lol...Love reverse lookup with a phone number.  Really, I'm far from psycho..but wouldn't that be the first thing a  psychotic would say?? Hmmm I may have to come with references. You do make me laugh though.. and I hope I do for you also....  hmmm.. do you still have a raised eyebrow? Can you do that? If was a good  stalker.. I would have all ready known what you had in your glove  compartment now wouldn't I??? So the dashboard is your favorite car part...  and I would think it would be a car part... although I doubt the have a lot  of extra car dashboards sitting in some car part warehouse.... so  interesting choice... why the dashoard? Let's see... the seat belt is a  good part.. keeps you safe...radio keeps you entertained, seat warmers keep  your buns warm (although don't have that yet), let's see my favorite car  part.. I would say the Key.. because you can't get in nor go anywhere  without it. Think I'm a freak??? lol - At least I'm interesting and funny..  if you see my sense of humor. I absolutely love Sade, in fact the concert 4 or 5 years back at  Blossom is still the best concert I've attended in my life. I even have a  couple remixed cd's of hers...one burned off from Napster, one purchased. I  have a varied musical interests... mostly female vocalists..and like a lot  of popular, however pass on the Brittney Spears, Christina Agularas, Boys  bands.. and that Celine Dion... Thanks for the pics.. guess it's my turn... and ya don't scare me  away and since my computer is still working, I can email you back. I think  I'll work from home tomorrow... so perhaps we can do lunch if your  available. Is your office downtown? You work for Playhouse Square? I don't  know if I read that or if it was something I had dreamed last night...  can't remember my dream... but for some reason it is in my head that you do  PR for Playhouse Sq.... although I don't see it in a previous email...oh  well. Well, I'm getting hungry.. I'm ready to eat my lunch early... so  drop me a line when you get a chance.. I have to prepare for a 2pm  conference call meeting.. that I may or may not have. I hope so.. because  the drive to the east side sucked!.. by the way... how was yours? your  drive home? hope you made it safely, and able to even read this today.  Well, I'll be anxiously waiting for your reply now.  Dan         At 05:36 PM 3/5/01 -0500, you wrote: Dan, I *did* get laugh out of your subject line. I agree that a corkscrew is an absolute necessity! You know what a horror it is to be anywhere and not be able to access the vino!! Wow! you have lots of stuff in your glovebox...everything except gloves, it seems. I have only my maintenance records and proof of insurance. I have no emergency provisions! I am a wreck! Favorite car part: dashboard, no question! IS that a car part? Well, if you were stalking me, you'd have some difficulty at the corner of W.53rd and Bridge because it doesn't exist...but my house sits exactly where you might imagine W.53rd would be...  You are a Sade fan?! She is one of my faves! I've been to both of her N. American concert tours...AMAZING!!! My musical tastes do not include country. Although, my sister seems to like it...  Well, I sent a few more pics...hopefully they didn't scare you off or crash your computer. All my pics are clean (just like me). Hope you had a safe drive! Be well, and I'll look forward to continuing this correspondence! You've helped make my day!!  Wish me well on a very long evening...if you're stalking tonight, I'll be back around 11p. I hope you have a wonderful evening, Dan!  Best, Todd
