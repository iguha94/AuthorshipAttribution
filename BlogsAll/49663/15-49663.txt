Let's see...can I remember all the way back to Friday? I left work Friday evening with a bad headache. I popped pills. I was better. I decided to hang around the house to act as moral and fashion support for Kelly, who was getting ready for Date #2 with Cameron. He arrived at the house at 8:00, and the three of us enjoyed some wine and mild conversation...that boy is no big talker, but definitely sweet. At one point, Kelly had to take a telephone call from her friend Cindy in Japan. That gave good 'ol Cam and me a chance to chatter. I don't remember anything specific...which, I guess, is specific enough. Anyway, after they hit the road, I invited Kim and Heather (friends from work) to come and party with me at my house. After all, it was cleaned immaculately and I had so many candles going you would have thought VH1 was taping  Behind the Music . We had a great evening telling stories, drinking and listening to crazy old tunes by Doris Day and Billie Holiday. Cam and Kel arrived home while my little impromptu party was raging. They went upstairs. The next day, I had to peel myself out of bed at 9:30 to get down to Mansfield, Ohio for a funeral of a family friend. The whole town is so depressing: gray and quiet and plunked down in the middle of nowhere. After returning to Cleveland, I went to see my friend's production of  Pippin  which was quite remarkable! Sunday morning, Kelly and I went to the Clifton Diner...no cutie to be found! DAMN! The food was fantastic, as usual. I spent the rest of the day doing laundry and studying my lines, which I am happy to report: I know!!  Last night, we went over to DVDave's to watch  Queer As Folk ...where I ran into this total beauty named Adam... swoon ...
