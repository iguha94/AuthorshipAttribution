edge of a line       Where do I go when there’s no left and no right?    How do I win with no one here to fight?   How do I know when you’re lost and not found?   Why do I hear this echo when you’re not around?      What do I do when there’s no right and no wrong?   Where do I go when there’s nowhere to belong?   Standing on a limb at the edge of a line   How do I love what isn’t even mine?      If words could tell the story   Speak the truth, decipher you   And even though I know the answer   I have questions, too      If I was there, you’d be somewhere away   If I could go anywhere at all, you’d stay   I could only dream of your kiss or your sigh   But saying hello would only mean goodbye      What do I say when there are no words to speak?   How do I hide with no place to seek?   Standing on a limb at the edge of a line   Clutching at a heart that’s not even mine      If words could tell the story   Speak the truth, decipher you   And even though I know the answer   I have questions, too      With so much confusion, it’s hard not to lose your way   It’s hard not to lose   It’s hard not to lose your way
