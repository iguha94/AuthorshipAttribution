Well, girls...I'm back from fishing. I have one word for you: YECCHHHH! Nine hours on a boat 12 miles out into Lake Erie is only considered a good time in my book if it includes hot, ripped naked dancing boys and a cooler full of alcoholic beverages. Instead, imagine being stranded on a boat with the cast of Grumpy Old Men. I was dying out there. And, to make it worse: I got tickets to the Madonna concert in Detroit! Late Saturday afternoon, my friend Michelle called and offered me two tix to that night's show! Ugh! I had to pass them up and I am a stupid-ass homo for doing so! Flog me later. Nothing but big beluga-whale sized relatives, burping, farting, phlegm-hawking and creepy-crawly live bait. Let me say this right here: I hate killing things. I always have. Once, when I was mowing the lawn, I accidentally ran over a big toad and decapitated it. I felt guilty for days...guilty enough to convert to Catholicism. So, imagine me piercing the bellies of those poor crayfish ( nee : crawdads, crawfish) and casting them into the depths of Lake Erie only to me gobbled up by Small-Mouth Bass or Sheepshead. I needed some sort of anti-nausea medication...if only I had brought along my big inflatable purse...it might have been able to paddle to shore...or at least tagged a chic tan on my way back to the beach. At any rate, me, the big fairy, caught NOTHING. Yes, this faggot can't fish. I can do plumbing, electrical...all sorts of highly-useful butch lesbianic activities, but I CANNOT FISH. I am working on a whole new thesis which I will present here at a later time. In any case, I'm glad to be back home...and yes, I made it in time for the Madonna concert live on HBO.
