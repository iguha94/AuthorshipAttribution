my big gay life [23]    So much for rest and relaxation this weekend! Friday, after a long day catching-up at the office, I took a brief nap and then Kelly and I went to Johnny Mango for dinner and drinks. While we were there, our friend Frankie (the chef) sat with us for a little while after he was through for the night. Kelly and I were having some mighty tasty Margaritas, when this guy (a server) comes over to chat with Frankie. It's his birthday and he offers to buy us a shot. Naturally, I accept. He's cute. Shaved head, dark goatee and tattoos...so not my type...except that he's sweet as hell. So, he invites me to meet him out at a club where he's meeting a few friends. Kelly and I both go. He leans over at one point and asks if I'm dating anyone. I, of course, say no. He then asks if he gives me his number, and I give him mine, could we call each other? I say sure, why not? What the hell? So, we spent a lot of time talking that night. I like talking. Anyhow, on Sunday, I went to DVDave's for my belated birthday party to celebrate with my big gay posse. After watching  Further Tales of the City , we headed out to Funky Buddha to go dancing. We stayed out til closing - I had a blast shakin' my groove thang. It's been so long since I've been dancing...and the best part is, the club didn't get busted-down by the ATF, DEA, FBI and SWAT like last time.
