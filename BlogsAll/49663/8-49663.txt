So, the Bob story. Way, way back...in the "way-back" file in my mind is a brief story of a beautiful infatuation/love gone terribly wrong. I met Bob, quite randomly, when I was out for a drink with friends. He was a friend of one of my friends...and we got to talking. Eventually, we started dating. I was happy. He was happy. Weeks flew by. I realized, after awhile, that our sexual activity had slowed down considerably...and this was a problem for me. A big one. I love sex. I want to have sex a lot when I'm in a relationship. I don't like NOT having sex. Anyway, I'd started to peek around...condom wrappers in the bathroom wastebasket...wrappers from condoms WE hadn't used. My mind started whirring like an overworked hard drive. Then I found out, through his friends, that Bob had visited the gay Bath Houses on many occasions...something that did NOT sit well with me...and believe you me: I am NOT a prude. Thus  Bath-House Bob  earned his moniker. The final straw, really, occured one evening when I signed onto my email account. I had become extremely suspicious and sneaky - and had devised a plan to TRAP him in his wandering ways. I created a new screen name and headed into the M4M chat room of the city he was visiting. Within 5 minutes, I had located him...and he had located me on his radar screen. Like a moth to a flame, he cruised me hard...even inviting me to his hotel room for sex. I asked for his hotel phone number "so we could talk a little" dialed the number and heard his voice answer on the other end. I was devastated, of course, but prepared to deal with it because I had, after all, wanted to know. So, thus ended our whirlwind romance. A nosedive into the dirt...smoking wreckage...it was over.
