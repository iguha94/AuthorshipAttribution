Today started, really, at 12:30 AM when I called his voicemail at the hotel. I had to leave a message saying goodbye and saying how sorry I was to miss him, but I had to get some sleep. After I had finished, I put the receiver in the cradle and drifted back to sleep. At 1:20 AM I woke to the electronic chirp of the telephone. His voice filled my head.    	Are you already in bed? he asked. Of course I was, who wouldn't be in bed at 1:20 in the morning? I remember some droning and frequent pauses. Neither of us knew quite what to say. And, as if we were following some hastily written script, we said goodbye, blandly.    	When I woke for good at 7:45, I readlied for work. Not many of my thoughts lingered about him. What I thought about mostly, was the regularity, the blissful predictability of my morning ritual and the routine of my work day. I had no sadness to fear...I could have said a thousand goodbyes and not cared because I knew that at 9:00 I would be on the phone, in my chair at the desk in my office, conducting business. But most of all, I would be safe from matters of the heart.    	Once, when the pace slowed, I decided to call him at the hotel. A final act of chivalry, I suppose. I remember my heart palpitating as I punched the numbers in on my telephone.    	Where may I direct your call?  the hotel operator asked crisply.    	Room 1322, please.    	And, there he was. The bass in his voice intensified by sleep.    	I just wanted to say goodbye one more time, I said.    	Oh...goodbye.
