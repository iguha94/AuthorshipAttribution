Antique hunting yesterday was a flop. Well, let me clarify: I was not hunting for antiques. I was hunting for  mystery David, actually, his friend Marc. However, Marc was not at his antique shop...as he was attending some big antique show somewhere down the pike. So, I got absolutely no new scoop on my mystery man. I'm starting to forget what he looks like...it's getting fuzzy. Then, as you know, I attended a little block party last evening. It was a fairly delightful party...especially when Dr. Tom arrived. As usual, he gave me a hard time - I think it's his hobby now. We sat together at dinner - amazing since my friend Larry was executing a cock-block (chatting/flirting with Tom). So, I was less than pleased with that...but then I decided I just don't give a fuck anymore. Whatever happens happens, right? Who needs to dedicate that kind of energy worrying about it?  I did drag my ass to church this morning. I am UCC...which is open and affirming of the Lesbian/Gay/Bi/Trans communities. And, in normal fashion, ended up flirting with this really cute guy - who ended up being a Presbyterian minister. I should say RECOVERING Presbyterian minister. He's a chaplain at a hospital now. He's incentive enough to keep going...outside of the fact, of course, that I have many friends who attend regularly.  I am going to go see the film THE TAO OF STEVE later this afternoon. Three filmmakers from my hometown made the flick. I can't wait to see it.  I'll be sure to report in later.
