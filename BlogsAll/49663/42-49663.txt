my big gay life [29]       Well, here I am two months after my little break-up episode with Dan. I can say that I am thankful for all the friends (old and new) who have leant their support and offered observations, humor and the services of their Uncle Vito should I need a certain someone to "disappear." In any case, it's been a wild and unexpected journey over the past 61 days or so...and I'm glad you were all along for the ride. My life has definitely moved in several other directions  away  from Dan, and I've met some really fantastic people, like Steve G., Charlie!!, Jody and John. I'm also lucky to have my guys at D.A.S. who love and amuse me on a weekly basis.  Okay, enough of that...   Last night, my friend John and I went to the Cinematheque to see a screening of  Plaster Caster . At first it seems like an intriguing idea...this groupie from the sixties goes around making plaster casts of various rockstar penises. Except, besides Jimi Hendrix, there's no one of note. This documentary chronicles Cynthia's preparations for her first big NYC gallery solo exhibit. Along the way, we meet many of the guys she's cast, and are forced to listen to punishing boring stories for nearly 2 hours. Ack! Avoid this film  at all costs!  Today, the sun has finally come out of hiding and I spent a good long time out in the yard soaking up rays...I'm so white...it's pathetic! I need color,  damnit!  Tonight, I'm going to the theatre to see a series of one-acts called  All In The Timing  so that should be fun. No, go out there and have a terrific day, alright! Go on... get outta here!
