         Days until my FINAL thesis is due: 34. Number of sleeps until then: 26.   Sunday continued....   Spent the rest of the day playing computer games.  Eventually it was dinner time, then bed time.  I won at Civ III (achieved a domination victory - your borders encompass more than 66% of the land mass).   Semester 1, Week 8, Day 1.   Slept in.  It was wonderful.  Benji had the day of work for ANZAC day.  So we dropped the car off at the mechanic (minor problem which should be covered by warrenty) and went to Eastland.  It's a bit scary there.  Poked my tongue out at a kid or two.  Had some lunch and then went back to Benji's.  Cup of tea and chess.  Wasn't feeling very good - neck headache.  Played  Settlers of Catan  with Jeff, Damien and Benji.  Damien won both games.  Home and bed.  Sleep is bliss.   Semester 1, Week 8, Day 2.   Starting to panic.  Completely uninspired for both course work subjects and should really write at least one of the essays or make a decent start on both of them soon, before thesis final is due in (that's worth 30% and the essays are 12.5% each.)  Also only 8 days until I have to give my practice oral presentation at the post grad seminar.  Sigh.  I can't wing it cold so I will have to do SOME work on it.  Seeing Dirk this afternoon to discuss oral presentation.  It would be nice if he had some time to actually give it some thought and discuss it with me.  (I should be alright anyway, but it's nice to get confirmation that you're on the right track.)  So this morning I have returned my nasty overdue library books, now I'm using the database journal thing to find some articles for coursework... and blogging.  Invention for the day: Cerebral implant teleprompter.
