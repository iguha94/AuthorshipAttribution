         Well, looking over the last post, at least I managed to achieve:  1. Cup of tea.  After that I had a snooze and then singing.  Days until my FINAL thesis is due: 33.  Days until Dirk will give me back the first draft: 5. Days until it's ALL OVER: 47. Number of things I have to do: 4 (Thesis, Oral Presentation and two essays for coursework.)   Semester 1, Week 8, Day 3.   Spent this morning reading the reading for Animal Minds, a paper by a lady called Susan Hurley.  I just love articles that go along the lines of "*blah* as I showed in *authorname* in my chapter N of my *bookname* (1996)"  Had a minor hissy fit and decided I couldn't do anything, was good at nothing and what the hell was I doing this all for anyway.  This seems to be becoming a regular (nay, daily) occurance.  Got on with it and started on my oral presentation, including reading what I'd written... OUT LOUD!!  It took about 9 minutes to read 1250 words, so I figure I need about 2400 words.  At one point I had 2800 words, but I cut back.  It is looking in a pretty fit state.  I don't like my exposition of Velleman, but I can change that.  Once I have some comments back from Dirk and am happy with it, I shall prepare the handout and the overhead projector stuff.  (I was considering using power point, but then I decided that would be a) showing off and b) tempting the fates of the stress chip inside the departments hardware.)  I am giving a practice Oral Presentation next Wednesday (in 7 days) at the postgrad seminar so I figured I'd rock up to one before I do so this week.  So I am going to the postgrad seminar.  Sigh.  Invention for the day: Change machines on buses.  I had correct change, but I think it would be a neat idea.
