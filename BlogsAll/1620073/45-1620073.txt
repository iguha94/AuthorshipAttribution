         I just got spam from Bertrand Russell.  How positive.  (That's a joke, Russell was a big maths and logic philosopher who was involved in what became known as Logical Positivism, which is widely discreditted by foreward thinking Australian philosophers and still embraced by skeptical American philosophers.)  A   picture  of me in Elizabethan (I not II).  (Thanks to David for hosting this.)  Spent the rest of Monday watching Friends and writing my Lit Review.  Wrote about 700 words.  Yay.   Semester 2, Week 11, Day 2.   Worked on Literature Review.  Wrote about 500 words.  Played the piano.  Went for a drive with David.  Went to singing.  We listened to a recording of us singing at the performance and then discussed what carols and performances we wanted to do for Christmas.   Semester 2, Week 11, Day 3.   Worked on Literature Review.  Wrote about 1200 words.  To have breaks I ate and played the piano.  Watched crappy television.    Semester 2, Week 11, Day 4.   Worked on Literature Review.  Wrote about 50 words.  Went to Metaphysics class and learnt about events and maths.  There will be no class next week because everyone's taking industrial action against the Nelson Deforms to funding.  (Not reforms....)  Made an appointment to see Dirk on Monday.  Went home and worked on my Literature Review.  Wrote about 600 words and I'm now going to send a very, very rough draft to Dirk.  Like, I'm still about 900 words under, but that's good, because I know I'll get comments and suggestions and I still have a bit of fleshing out to do.  (Especially on Plato's theory of love.  What a loser.  Thinks he's so clever because he hides behind dialog and uses Socrates as a mouth piece.)  Plans for this evening -  go swimming, chat with Jeanie, eat, sleep.  Invention for the day: Bathers and towels that dechlorinated themselves and dried perfectly in your bag from week to week.
