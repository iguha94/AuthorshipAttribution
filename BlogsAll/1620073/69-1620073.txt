         I just removed the following from my thesis draft:  Therefore love is analogous to a dogâ€™s desire to sniff one another.   Do Ants Dream of Anarchy?   I have been plagued by ants recently.  I can never bring myself to kill them, though Benji has no such qualms.  He explains it something along the lines of there being no one ant, as such, just ants.  I can't help it, just now I spent ages try to blow and flick the little antikins outof my bowl and into the sink.  Then I had an idea.  When I was talking to Benji about ants, it seemed to me that his theory was that the colony was analogous to a person and cells to ants.  No one really cares about a few cells, otherwise anti-dandruff shampoo manufacturers would really just be big undertakers.  But what is it that combines these things together...  Well, I thought it could be their desires.  Ants are all after the same thing.  If one is squished, the others continue onwards.  Is it sad that the ant died?  Has it lost something precious?  No, because its goal and desirres are continuing to be fulfilled.  If I die tomorrow, will I have lost something?  Yes.  I desire to write a thesis and that thesis will always remain unwritten.  What I cannot answer is if a whole colony of ants die, will that be sad?  I'm a bit of a softy (as my inability to squish a single ant shows) so I'm inclined to say yes.  It seems to be that a whole heap of rather clever industy to build the colony that is now destroyed was wasted... just as I am wasting my time on my thesis if I die tomorrow.  Anyway, I was just thinking about desires and their relationship to identity.  When a couple marry they are thought to combine their desires to some extent.  Society also sees them as a unit, perhaps because of their desires being the same (or their bank accounts and addresses...)  No real conclusion. :)  Oooh. One of the little guys certainly has a thing for the F8 key.... just you wait until Benji comes home.
