          Semester 1, Week 2, Day 1.   Went and saw a counsellor at Monash Uni.  Everyone seems to think that voice recognition software is the way to go....  He recommended I register with the Disability Liason Unit.  So I went to try and do that, but I have to have something filled out by my doctor.  (Now as fun as paying $45 so my doctor can fill out form sounds, I decided to see if I could get out of this requirement.)  Sigh.  I have an appointment for Thursday anyway... I anticpate playing my stupid card.  "Oh, but isn't this letter enough?"  I booked Benji and I into Beginners Italian - a short course at Monash.  I figured it would be fun to start to learn another romance language that's similar to Latin...  (and Benji just wanted to learn Italian.)  Then walked back to Benji's place.  Opened up my thesis documents, closed them.  Attempted to snooze.  Walked back to uni.  Made appointment to have hair cut.  Went to philosophy lunchies.  Sat at looked knowledgable.  Spat out epic tale of broken arm.  Went and had hair cut.  No one will notice - but feel free to pretend.    Went and negotiated deadlines with Toby.  Here they are:  Monday Week 07 17/4 - Draft Thesis Monday Week 10 10/5 - Oral Presentation Monday Week 13 31/5 - Final Draft Monday Week 15 14/6 - Essays  He asked if I wanted to just push the whole lot back until next semester, but I said I was funding myself, couldn't work and would kind of like for it to be over.  Walked back to Benji's.  Plans for the rest of the day: Food.  Go to beach with Benji.  He insists.  Invention for the day: A liitle dust buster like device that is powerful enough to pick up hair, but not so powerful as to attempt to swallow your clothes.  I am covered in snippets.
