         I have begun to wonder what will happen to my blog once I finish honours, as it has been primarily focused around honours, as my life has been primarily focused around honours.  Obviously this leads to thoughts about what I want to do after honours.  I don't think "attempt to have my blog published and live of the royalties" is a viable option.  Especially seeing as I could hardly offer exclusive rights or anything.  (I have a cup of tea now, things should start looking up...)  Both Benji's parents managed to ask the question equivalent of "So... whatcha gonna do after honours?"  Sigh.  This has also led me to think about what I want to do after honours.  All of this thinking has led me to one conclusion: Both time and money are finite.  Sigh.  (It has also led me ot think that I would get more out of life by living it, rather than sighing over it.)  I think there are conflicting wants in life, just the way things are.  I would like to:   a) study forever b) own a house c) have a meaningful career d) travel a lot  Some of these things are compatible a bit, but not all of them all of the time...  So, what am I going to do after honours?  1. Go to Cairnes with Benji. 2. Graduate (well apply to graduate in absentia... not paying for the stupid robes again.) 3. Pray.  In that order.  That seems like a good start.  After all, I had to go to Perth to figure out I  really  wanted to do honours.  It's amazing how Victoria rots your brain!
