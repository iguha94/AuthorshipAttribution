         Number of sleeps until the weekend: 2. Number of days until draft due: 12. Number of sleeps until draft due: 7 or 8.   Semester 1, Week 6, Day 3.   Read Animals Minds article by Davidson.  He considers that to have a belief you require language and you have to have beliefs about beliefs.  It is supposed to be revolutionary and really amazing.  For some reason I found it was the biggest load of bollocks!  (I might have missed some of the subtleties in his argument.)  Went to the travel agent in Oakleigh, where I spent two hours.  Benji and I are going to Cairnes in June - they are having a   special  at the moment called "get on up".  The guy said that Tassie will be having one soon.  I asked if it would be the "get on down" special?  He thought this was funny.  (We got great air fairs, like $380 return each...)  Went to see Dirk for my supervisor meeting.  He hadn't read my thing.  Sigh.  He had read the thing I sent him last Thursday - chatted briefly about that and my oral presentation (he said we needed to discuss my objective, I said my objectives were to have people go "Lucretius Lucretis Ra Ra Ra!"  (with pom pom moves) he said we needed to discuss my objective...)  Back to Benji's place.  Did some Italian homework for class tomorrow.  It's pretty stressful because she talks to you in Italian and you have to respond.  But, it is pretty laid back so it's not too bad.  Benji and I made pumpkin lasagna.  Yumm.  Edges were a little crusty, but it's all good.  Invention for the day: Supervisor rack.  (Or that think out of  Clockwork Orange  that holds open eyes, plays Beethoven and forces the supervisor to read your thesis as it is displayed on a screen.)  Could also be used for getting better marks.
