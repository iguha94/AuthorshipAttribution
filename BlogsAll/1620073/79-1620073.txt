          Classes on Thursday.   Classes were good, though it proved to be a long day.  I questioned my wisdom of having all of my classes on the same day (all two of them...)  Animal Minds, I volunteered to present the readings for next week (get it over with).  Value Theory, well, I had read the article, even if no one else had.   Semester 1, Week 2, Day 5.    Went to the DLU - I am now officially disabled.  The guy was really nice to me and said that I didn't need any more documentation the stuff I had already.  Then he wrote me a letter and gave me several copies and told me to go and apply for a weeks extension. So I went and saw Toby and he said I could have a weeks extension, but we are still going to treat the original due date as is - but I can have the extension as soon as I ask for it (psychological thing.)  Went home, spent a lot of time on the couch watching  Blackadder II  and sleeping.  Did some work on a presentation I have to do for Animal Minds.  Friday night, went swimming.  I did a whole 8 laps (where a lap is "there", and another lap is "back") before giving up and going into the spa.  Went and had dinner with swimmy folk and I had a drink spilt down the back of my jacket, which I'd just put on.   Saturday.   Slept in.  Played chess and generally chatted to Benji.  Spent the afternoon reading and dying hair.  Went to Avril's place for dinner and then onto David's birthday party.  Had a good time, which was a bit surprised at, though I did drink four bicardis.   Sunday.   Blurk.  Spent a significant part of the morning in pain and shivering from the bicardis.  Didn't make it to church.  Went for a walk after some breakfast, I've just been playing  Dungeon Keeper II  and next Benji and I are going grocery shopping (we know how to live.)  Invention for the day: Star Trek like diagnostic device that tells you in advance how much water you should drink before going to bed really drunk.
