         I'm at Jeans's place.  Everyone has the net at home, but me.  (And possibly my house mate.)  We just did Circuit.  It was good.  I met a guy called Greg who was in FOME ages ago....  I can't remember what I did the rest of Monday, I went shopping and went to aerobics though.   Exam Period, Third Tuesday.   Went for a bike ride.  A LONG one.  Rode to Oakleigh, then along Scotchmans Creek to East Malvern, then up the Anniversary Trail to the Main Yarra Trail, then along the Yarra Trail to Templestowe.  Had lunch with Dad and Selina and rode back.  I was a bit stuffed at the end of it all.  Went to not-singing.  A bunch of singers sitting around on a Tuesday watching The Simpsons and discussing Mel Gibson.   Exam Period, Third Wednesday.   Can't have been very interesting because I don't remember and it was only yesterday.  Did have a picnic with Hannah and Sascha, which I remember, so it was cool.  Watched a lot of tv I think.   Exam Period, Third Thursday.   Today.  Went to Chadstone and took advantage of the Target sale, bought a pair of shorts.  Looked at buying bathers, but it was all too soul destroying.  Buying bathers is possibly worse than buying shoes, and THAT's saying something.  Went to Spaghetti Junction Spotlight and bought an embroidery kit.  Went home, started embroidering with Hannah while watching Buffy (she's run out (watched all her DVDs) but she's getting more (more DVDs)).  Dave rang and came over with food.  Had lunch with Dave and Hannah.  They left, Hannah to work, Dave to somewhere else that was less awkward.  Watched tv and embroidered, went to Circuit.  Invention for the day:  Some kind of machine that customises bathers to suit at a reasonable price.
