          Junked Introduction   This is an introduction to my thesis that I wrote yesterday when I was feeling a little miffed and had a small case of blank-screenophobia.  Enjoy!  It seems traditional, almost imperative, to begin any treatise on love with a cute quote from literature or philosophy.  Over the past year I have read many quotes and been unimpressed by all of them.  Each of them lacked something when talking about love.  They failed to encapsulate the many highs and lows of love as well as that settled feeling one gets from knowing one is loved.  Perhaps this demonstrated to me more clearly than any individual work on love that there are many aspects to it and it is difficult to capture.  One philosopher who also seemed to come to this conclusion was Lucretius, a Roman Epicurean who wrote in the first century B.C.E.  But none of the contemporary literature mentioned him at all.  They were all busy writing about Plato, Aristotle and St. Paul.  They were writing about whether love was in response to properties or created properties.  They were asserting that it was very silly anyway, because how could it be that someone was in love with a property and not a person.  They wrote about how love started and how love continued.  And if it got too much for them, well, they wrote that it wasnâ€™t really love after all.  Lucretius wrote about all these things, but he has been traditionally condemned as a mad, bitter man who wrote in his lucid moments before committing suicide over a failed love affair.  My thesis then, aims to show why all these philosophers are talking about all these issues to cross-purposes so that, hopefully, no one will ever have to write another treatise on love that starts with a cute quote again!  (But I'm not bitter.  These are the views of Ainsley, who has been scorned as a mad, bitter woman...)
