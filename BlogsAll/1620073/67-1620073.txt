          Tuesday:  Slept terribly.  Then slept in until 11:00.  Netted.  Went to Chadstone with Mel.  Singing.   Wednesday:  Lunchies in the city with Benji (had a conference.)  Read   Lady of Quality .   Thursday:  Went to uni.  Saw Dirk.  (Now have feedback.)   Finished  Lady of Quality .  They get engaged - no surprises there.  Got invited to go to Oakleigh swimming centre.  Grumble.  You know who you are!   Friday:   Today.  Sigh.  6 weeks today since I broke my arm.  Yay!  Saw doctor this morning.    My arm has not healed yet, still have severe lack of twisting ability.  I may have permanent inflexibilty.  (The weakness (non-grippyness) is just immobilty, though it still hurts.)  So another 3 weeks in plaster cast.  Sigh.  Even if it's okay, I will need physio (4 weeks).  3 weeks takes me right up to the start of semester (and Jeans' birthday).    If it is still not better, I may have to have surgery.	The way it fractured indicates that I have ripped a disc out from where it should be.  Surgery would replace disc (I imagine.)  He said if it had been caught in the first week, I would have had surgery initially, rather than waiting and seeing.  Grumble.  Benji has been wonderful, came with me today (duh, I needed the lift).  I cried all the way home from Ashwood (High St/Warrigal Rd).  Invention for the day: VCR that recognises the difference between ads and program and will not fast forward through program.  Also there should be two remotes for any electrical good such as DVD, VCR, TV etc.  A his.  And a hers that cuts off his.    If there's one thing that REALLY bugs me, it's people flicking channels during the ads when you just know they're not going to flick back in time and you're going to miss the important 15 seconds of post ads where they resolve in some stupid way the cliff hanger they set up right before the ad break.  (I don't know if Benji does this.  I just wanted to rant.)
