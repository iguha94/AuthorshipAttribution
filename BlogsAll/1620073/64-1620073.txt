          Yesterday.   I watched a lot of cricket.  I also watched  Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion  while waiting until 11:00 for the cricket.  They go to their 10 year reunion.  It's 2004.  I finished high school in 1994.  And what am I?  A philosophy student.  I think I'd be making something up too.  Something believable.  Something like, "I'm a Analyst Programmer for a multi-national corporation... no wait! I quit that job.  Nope, sorry.  I'm a philosophy student."   Today.   Less cricket.  Mostly in doctors waiting room.  Went to the doctors to have check up and potential fibre glass cast - as recommended by doctor on Friday.    He wasn't happy about something on the x-ray, (might be additional fractures or just a glitch).  So I have to have another couple of x-rays (including my right hand for comparison) and see him on Thursday.  At this rate I could become Fallout Boy! He took off the cast by cutting it twice and manipulated my hand for about half an hour and compared it to the right hand a lot.  I now have two sore wrists.    In the mean time my arm is now in the same old plaster cast with new padding and a bandage wrapped around it.  Joy.  At least it's firm - before I could move my arm up and down the cast by a good inch.  Tomorrow I go to have x-rays.  Thursday back to doctors.  On the plus side, if it's just the little fracture that the x-ray shows for sure, I may just have to have a splint - there is no need for the cast.  If, on the other hand I have additional fractures, it's bad bad news.  Invention for the day:  Doctor's surgeries that have decent radiology equipment so that they only charge one $92 consultation fee.
