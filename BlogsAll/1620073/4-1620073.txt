         I am all dressed up.  We (David, Bowie, Katie and I) are going to Jacques Reymonds (this flash restaurant).   I am sitting all dressed up with a little more time to go before I have to go to Bowie's to catch a taxi.  I have already thought of three things I would have done differently:  1. Worn loser skirt to accomodate food. 2. Don't like hair, needs more/less moose. 3. Some kind of hand jewellery (ring, bracelet) would look good.  Oh well.  Too late now (especially for my hair).  I reached new depths of nothingness today.  Sat around in the house until 4:00 in my dressing gown.  First I completed my game of Civilization (95%, more than 1500 points).  Then I watched the cricket on tv.  That was about it.  Oh, had deep and meaningful discussion about having to take off clothes with house mate (while cricket was on).  I mean why?  Why is it so difficult?  Why does it feel great to bum around the house in the jammies you've been wearing since three o'clock yesterday afternoon?    She cracked first, she had to go to uni before the book shop closed.  (Semester starts on Monday!!!)  Took a while to transform myself from tracky-dacked, flannel wearing couch sponge to fantastic society go-getter - but a bit of Australis lip stick and some flash tights can do anything.  (Especially combined with aforementioned tight skirt.)  Spending tonight at Bowie and Katie's.  I wonder where they live....  Invention for the day: Shower you can have without having to take off your clothes.  Sigh.
