         Number of days until thesis draft is due: 18. Number of other honours students who were a little freaked out when I told them their synopsis was due in 18 days: 4.   Semester 1, Week 5, Day 4.   Slept in, glorious.  Classes today.  Animal Minds - Discussed the difference between preferences and drives.     Value Theory - Discussed a paper that aimed to diss the "combat view" of motivation (beliefs vs desires) and replace with Kant/Plato's three element version.  Went and had dinner and Benji's.  Italiano - Learned 0-100, seasons, months and some professions.  Fraccio la studentessa.  Come back to Benji's place to check email and blog.  In between all of that, I had printed out my thesis yesterday (which Benji went over.)  Today I went over it myself and began to really think about some of what I'm saying and edit/polish it.  I'd forgotten how much of a difference printing the thing out and having it stare at you makes.  A girlie from class wants me to email her a draft (which I am fairly happy to do).  But I thought I'd clean it up a little first.  I will want people to read it in about a week, I think.  (Please email me if you want a copy, preferably if you want to edit a copy....)  Invention for the day: Instant peer review - just add water.
