         Meeting with Dirk went well, was short.  He has promised to god (not bad for an aetheist) that he will read my thesis on Thursday, or failing that Sunday, but definately by Monday at 2:00 when I am meeting him again.  Now have to prepare oral presentation.  Sigh.  I have decided to concentrate a bit on Value Theory because I have read all the articles and I think I should be able to come up with something to write about on a lady called   Christine Korsgaard .  She is pretty neat.  Her basic idea is that the basis for normativity (why we are obligated to do stuff) is that there are no private reasons for actions, but only public reasons which we construct.  So, this eliminates the egoists idea that it is impossible for my private reasons to become reasons for me to help you.  There are only public reasons that give us reason to help each other.  (Insert small gripe about stupid buttons on the mouse on the left side that tell Internet Explorer to go Back, when all you were doing was casually reaching for the mouse here.)  So now what?  Still uninspired.  Suppose I'd best work on my oral presentation.  Dirk said to do a good handout.  Maybe I'll start with that.  Mouse (girl in korner) said I looked tired.  Didn't sleep well last night.  Failed in my quit coffee campaign, had coffee last night.  What was I thinking?  (I think it was something along the lines of, "Stuff this.  I'm tired, they're going to be drinking it in front of me and it's going to smell mighty good.")  Was this self-betrayal or a genuine change of heart?  (We were looking at the difference in Value Theory last week.)  I'm inclined to go with self-betrayal.  Ah well.   I think I will act as follows:  1. Cup of tea. 2. Prepare (start to prepare) Oral Presentation.  (According to Velleman, believing that I will act in a certain way gives me good reason to act in a certain way...)
