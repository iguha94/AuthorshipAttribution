         Number of days until thesis draft is due: 17.   Semester 1, Week 5, Day 5.   How?  How can it be the end of week 5???  I haven't done anything yet.  I feel my week is divided into two halves, the bit where I do work and the bit where I stress that Dirk hasn't read my draft yet.  Today I did some domestic chores and some thesis type stuff.  In the middle of all of this, I went and caught up with Jeanie and she fed me a rather yummy lunch.  I attempted to bash out a conclusion....  I am finding it harder and harder to think about my thesis and to really work on it.  I feel it is more like an unstable block construction that I can't change too many blocks of, otherwise it will fall over.  I think it already has fallen over, but if I just add a few more blocks it will be much more stable when I re-build.  Sigh.  Still sitting at about 7600 words (it needs to be 8,000-10,000), but there's no danger of not making the word limit.  I forgot to mention, I came up with names for my two accounts:  Merit = sploosh (property based value) Dignity = moosh (innate "true self" value)  Yay me!   What I need to be able to do is to poke holes in the piece as a whoel, so I know where to sure it up.  I am having trouble thinking about it.  I have thoughts, but the seem slippery and fleeting (and rather unformed.)  Brain hurts.  In other news: Kidding.  There is only thesis.  Tomorrow we pick up Benji's new car.  Invention for the day: Auto thesis checker that pokes holes in arguments.
