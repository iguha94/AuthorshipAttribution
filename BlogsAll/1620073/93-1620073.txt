          Easter Tuesday continued...   Went over Dirk's comments.  Won at chess against Benji... eventually.  Managed to get my pawns to the other side for the first time against him.  Singing - some people actually even turned up.  Congrats to them!  Sang  Who Wants to Live Forever , a lot.   Easter Wednesday.   Did some nasty administrative things that have been hanging over my head.  These included paying an overdue phone bill and putting a deposit down on our accomodation.  Went and saw Dirk.  Came up with a few ideas about thesis.  He said we would talk about Oral Presentation and postgraduate stuff after I handed in my draft.  (Apparently Monash Uni take into account your honours marks (like you need an H1 (80%)) but also place heavy emphasis on your undergrad marks.  I wish someone had told me that six years ago.  Mine aren't bad (obviously, because I got into honours), but only one HD in 3rd year philosophy isn't promising...  Dirk said that Melbourne place more emphasis on your honours marks and that it would certainly be worth while applying there.  They have good facilities too.)  Spent this afternoon going over my thesis and re-formatting my footnotes to fit with the style of Bibliography I was copying from my lit review.  Suddenly my word count went nuts!  There is a big difference between "Keller (2000) 175." and "Simon Keller, 'How do I love thee : Let me count the properties', American Philosophical Quarterly, p 175."  Ended up shortening them by refering to the full title the first time, then indicating that I was going to abbreviate.  This helped.  Plans for this afternoon:  Italian homework (i.e. break from thesis.)  Plans for rest of the week:  THESIS!!!!  Invention for the day: The kind of rubber used in dodgem cars to be placed on the edges of computer desks.  (My knees have several bruises.)
