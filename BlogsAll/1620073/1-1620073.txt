         Found out David didn't invent the term Ontological Shock.  My faith in his vocabulary is shaken.  Got an email!!!  Turns out he was marking first year exams.  That seems excusable (at least it won't happen during semester, except they'll have essays.  Damn.)  Bed time: 12:30am Up time: 10:40am Left house: 12:30pm  Cigaretts: 0 Alcohol Units: 1.5 platinum 7s (vanilla and vodka) and some bundy. Weight: Steady (yay) even with wet hear and towel.  Once again I weigh less that the Aussie Dollar in kilograms vs US cents.  Today I am going to the induction of my dad.  Dad's an Anglican Minister and he is starting at a new parish.  Induction is the ceremony where they introduce you to the new parish and then you start taking services there.  It starts at 8:00 tonight, so I am glad it's not a school night (for me.)  David is coming too, but he doesn't pumpkin* the way I do.  My mother tends to refer to all of these things as "getting done".  After baptism, confirmation, ordination, consecration, induction and marriage I can see why.  *  Pumpkin  - from Cinderella.  Pumpkin time is when it is time to go home (else your carriage turns into pumpkin).  When one gets really tired and is no longer fit for any social contact.  Invention for the day: Sound proof residential construction material (I am sick of hearing Dave's neighbours torture (not play) Tool and Rage Against the Machine bass riffs)
