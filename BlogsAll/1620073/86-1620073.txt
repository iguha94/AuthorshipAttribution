         Number of days until you know what: 20.  Amount of denial that Ainsley is in:  LOTS!   Sunday cont.   Went to Chadstone the Fashion Captial, bought Benji a pair of sneakers.  They're white.  Did stuff at Benji's place, played chess, dinner, sleep.   Semester 1, Week 5, Day 1.   It rained!  Got a lift home from Benji in the morning.  Sat around and watched tv all day feeling miserable and head-achy.  Really stiff muscles in neck and back.  Things were so bad I ended up watching  Judge Judy .  Did manage to read the Animal Minds reading for Thursday though.  Spent more than an hour in the bath and my toes went very prune like.    Benji came around and we got pizza.  Watched  The Princess Bride  on DVD.   Semester 1, Week 5, Day 2.   Woke up with head ache continuing.  Neurofen, deep heat (on neck and NOT sunburnt shoulders) and shower later and I still don't feel that amazing (actually I felt so unamazing this morning that I threw up in the shower.  Very clean.)  Caught the 703 to Syndal Station.  There I met a lady who is plugging Science Works.  She goes all over Melbourne to libraries and drops off little pamphlets fo their exhibitions.  She thought that Syndal was a lovely area.  It is, I guess.  Or it would be if the suburb still existed.  It's really just the fringes of Mt Waverly and Glen Waverly.  Caught the train (where the lady sat next to me, prattling on some more) to Glen Waverly.  Visited   mecu , my credit union (who are ace - I have gotten various members of the social group on to them.  If you're sick of being treated badly by fascist banks, I'd go to them.)  Did stuff.  Wandered around the Glen looking at the Beige Generation (the ones who came just before the Baby Boomers, as far as I can tell.)  Caught the 737 from Glen Waverley to Monash and started to blog....  Invention for the day: Deep heat that can be put on abrased or sunburnt skin.
