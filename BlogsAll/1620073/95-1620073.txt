         6 days to go.  I'll jump right in!   Saturday.   Went to the prom from the farm and did the Lilly Pilly Gully walk, which is about two hours.  Played games and did stuff on the farm.   Easter Sunday.   Went on the four wheeler bike to look for a calf.  Got very dusty and disgusting hair.  Played lots more games.  Benji and I tried to get Word 97 to work on my laptop.  Sigh.  Some Easter egg hunting.   Easter Monday.   Went to Yarram.  Benji got a flat tire, so we changed it.  Back to the farm for lunch, then back home.  Aerobics!  Benji and I are a bit sore.   Easter Tuesday.   Slept in!  Went to Chadstone the Fashion Capital for a bit.  Didn't buy anything.  Don't have any money.  (Well, don't have any money that I want to spend.  Obviously have some money.)  I am going to look over Dirk's comments - seeing him tomorrow.  (Less than a week to go!  Nail biting time!)  Decided that coffee makes me feel ill and jittery.  Asked Benji to help me quit.... he seems to think this includes tea too.  So not!  Invention for the day: Coffee that doesn't make me ill and jittery - but still improves brain functions.
