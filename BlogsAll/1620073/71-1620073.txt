         Number of hands used to type this: 1. Number of brain cells used to type this: ?   Yesterday   Went to uni, got a Value Theory (one of my two corse work subjects) reading by Velleman.  Managed to get there (despite the persistant crush of over enthusiastic first years) before lunch and the department office closing.  Met up with Hannah and she gave me a lift to the physio.  The physio seemed pretty happy with my hand.  She said it will take some time.  Being able to lean on my hand could takes moths.  Goody.  Singing was okay.  We sang  For the Longest Time .  My part (alto) has several words.  Not only to we get to sing Woh, but also Oo, Ah and Boom.  Sounds a bit like sex really.  We also began work on  Who Wants to Live Forever  which we haven't done since 1996.  Scary.   Semester 1, Week 1, Day 3.   Read:  Velleman, J. David, 'Well-Being and Time',  The Possibilty of Practical Reason , Oxford University Press, 2000.  Brief summary:  Velleman thinks that the amount of well being experienced in moments (moment well-being) cannot bear any relationship to the amount of well-being experienced as a life.  No classes until tomorrow.  Hah!  Those 4 contact hours on a Thursday are a real strain.  Invention for the day: Some kind of slapping device that finds and slaps people who think that randomly initialising part of their name is a good thing.  Prime candidates should be C. S. Lewis, C. I. Lewis (philosopher, wrote  An Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation ), J. K. Rowling, J. R. R. Tolkien, Micheal J. Fox and George Bush Senior (for having a son and then naming his son after him).
