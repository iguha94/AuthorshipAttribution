          Sunday.... later.   Head feeling much better.  It's amazing what Deep Heat (a loving massage) and Neurofen can do.  Played a couple of games of queenless chess (we play without starting with queens and if a pawn gets to the end, you get to chose what piece you want (that's not a queen)).  Ended up losing one game and in the next, drew (both only had kings left).  Playing with queens means that Benji womps my butt big time (he is a more experienced and superior player.)  Going through my thesis in an effort to summarise my point, as I feel I change my point a couple of times half way through whatever it is that I'm doing.  If I understand what my main points are then I might just manage to keep on track.  (I would put them up here, but as some of you lovely people are going to look at my thesis, I don't want to bias you.... yet.)  I had to hand write it so that it felt all informal and non-committal.  All I have to do is not lose it.  (I couldn't even write in my note pad...)  Plans for tonight...  It's already dark.  I want day light savings back!  (Or at least a minimum of 12 hours day light every day, preferably when I'm up.)  Oh well, seven months of miserable and eight months of rain and then it will be good again.  (I never really did get the hang of Melbourne, I've only been here nine years.)  Go to the supermarket and get food for Benji and I to eat.  Cook (assemble) and eat dinner.  Stuff (may involve thesis). Sleep.  Next week is week 6, then Easter, then thesis, then oral presentation, then thesis (final draft).  Somewhere in that I get to write 9000 words for the subjects I'm doing.    At the end of all this, I am going on holiday!
