          Animal Minds   Was good.  We didn't get to the second article so I was spared.  Can read it for next week.    We talked about beliefs a lot.  Beliefs are supposed to be necessary for a mind.  Davidson thinks that beliefs about beliefs are necessary for a mind (and necessary for beliefs, if you have beliefs you must have beliefs about beliefs...) and that beliefs (as they are abstract) can only be represented through language.  I guess autistic people don't have minds....   Value Theory   Was interupted by the stinky students protesting about the Monash 25% increase in fees.  After we evacuated the Ming Wing and went back up, had lovely discussion about how our life story is not just historical note taking but also provides reasons for action (based on yet another paper by Velleman...) by you committing to something.  Whe puttering about the office, I say "I am going home now." and this will help make it true.  This week should be good because I don't have anything new to read (apart from the second article in Animal Minds and Davidson).  For Value Theory we need to think about how our conception of agency gives rise to reasons for action.  Sigh.  There is only two of us in the class and a lurker (who does speak) so I will have to have something to say.  Think I'll go scavenge some food before Italiano at 6:30.  (The homework went well, though my conversations were dead boring.  That reminds me, I meant to write up my conversations properly.  Will do so, after food.)
