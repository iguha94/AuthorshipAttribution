         Number of weeks until ... you know...: 2 Number of words (including footnotes and references, because they are included): 8,898   Semester 1, Week 6, Day 1.   Thesis.  All day.  Some breaks.  Spent the morning going over the Merit Account.  Added lots of quotes from Delaney and Keller and refined point of view.  Started having a minor panic early on, but got over it.  Restructured and edited.  Think it is pretty fit.  Spent the afternoon going over the Dignity Account.  Restructured and edited.  Still think it needs a bit of work.  I think the important thing is that I've shown how there have ALWAYS been two accounts of love - I think (though I have not said so, yet) that there are two accounts because they are trying to solve the conflict between:   Loving someone unconditionally AND Loving someone who merits it   Still need to go over Lucretius and Nussbaum again - but I think I know what I am doing there now.  (Have made summary notes of how sex transforms into love which transforms into psychopathic DOOM!!)  Plan to do this tomorrow and give to Dirk (somehow, seeing email is down for maintenance.  Grrrr.)  Invention for the day: Backup email address that maintenance notice emails are sent to in advance so you can plan around these things.  Grrrr.
