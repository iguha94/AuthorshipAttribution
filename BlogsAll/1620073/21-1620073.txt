         I have escaped to David's place where there is a heater in the same room as the computer.  Novel.  I have been really slack, but it's so cold and my brain, fingers and toes are freezing.  We got our electricity bill and it was heaps (like four dollars a day), so Hannah and I are just being cold at the moment.  (We don't have gas.)  But sitting at the computer in my scarf and blanket doesn't help my fingers and toes.   Semester 2, Week 4, Day 3.   Did a bit of free writing and wrote a bit of synopsis.  Went and did a brief bit of grocery shopping and had lunch with Jeanie (who did her ankle on Monday at aerobics.)  Hung around until about 4:00 and then went home and did more work.  Gave up when Neighbours came on.  Too cold.   Semester 2, Week 4, Day 4.   Went to Metaphysics class.  Not sure if I have no questions because I am so great or my understanding is so crap.  Went to the FOME meeting and made Trogdor the Burnitator out of purple play-dough.  It was "make your own moster (really)" day.  Came home and did some reading until I decided I was tired, so I had a snooze instead of working.    Dave came over and we went out for tea.   Semester 2, Week 4, Day 5.   Spent this morning with Mum and Dad, talking about life (mostly honours and dead Roman guys).  Mum is in hospital having something removed that they will then do tests on to see if it's cancer.  She is not very optimistic.  Spent a bit of time on my synopsis before being too cold to think.  I think I have sorted out Nussbaum (after about five attempts.)  I went to have another go at Brown but I couldn't concentrate so I left it.  My brain feels like slippery glass and nothing will stick to it.  Invention for the day: Electric heaters that are cheap to run.
