          Creative Love   Creative love theorists consider that love creates value in the beloved.  (I think that this means that they either go straight for value, they make up reasons/properties or they don't think that properties are important.)   The Rest Of Friday   Ended up writing a bit on Creative Love after I got jack of writing about Responsive Love.  Went to Jeans place, had dinner and picked on Janeway's hair.  As predicted.     Saturday   Slept in.  Glorious.  Benji and I went to the Organ Pipes National Park (which is opposite Caulder Park Raceway).  Steep but shot walk to see lava in specky formation.  Lots of fun, but perhaps not worth the drive.  Attempted to drive around the car park at the National Park.  This proved a) difficult and b) painful.  Couldn't stick it in reverse at all (involves lifting a small knob on the gear stick) and although shifting up was okay, shifting down hurt.  Steering was somewhat precarious too.  Moped about my continued uselessness.  Had mad thoughts about buying a cheap auto, does seem rather silly though.  Benji and I have been playing a lot of chess lately.  He is a superior player, and although I am improving, he is much more familiar with things like forcing the king to step back into a corner.   Sunday   Although not mentioned on previous blog entries, Benji and I have been going to church on Sundays since the beginning of the year (except when we've been at Toora.)  Went to Chadstone the Fashion Capital and Benji had his hair cut and bought some ear phones.  He thinks that this will mean that he can play more computer games.  Ha!  Sat around this afternoon and played chess.  I took Benji's queen in an act of severe stupidity on his part in one of the games.  Did teeny bit of work on thesis.  Invention for the day: Small invisible leprechaun that sits on my shoulder and tells me whenever I'm about to make a stupid move in chess.
