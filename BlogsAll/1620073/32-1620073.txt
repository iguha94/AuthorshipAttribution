         Woah, haven't written for a while.  Today I am in the Library at uni.  I have just beaten my brain against some more of David Lewis's articles.  Sigh.  Someone has just put a re-call on the book I borrowed by Lewis.  It's mine!!!! I borrowed it first!!!!!  Now it's due in 5 days.  I wonder if I can put a re-call notice on the other copy?  I might have to read it now, rather than just feel smug about it being in my collection on the floor (which is litterally a foot high).   Semester 2, Week 7, Day 3.   Spent the day procrastinating and eventually prepared for my presentation.   Semester 2, Week 7, Day 4.   Had metaphysics presentation.  I was either a) really funny or b) a complete loser.  I made jokes all the way through.  It was on bare particulars, so I took in a teddy bear and his jumper.  The first presentation was on "Bare Particulars" so I took off his jumper, then it was "Particulars Re-Clothed" so I put his jumper back on.  About three minutes into my first presentation, John Bigelow (I think he's way up there in the department) says "Oh, I get it.  Not only have you taken off his clothes, but you've mispelt 'bare'".  Sigh.  As you can see, we're a bright lot.  Rode from my place, to Jells Park and then to Dandenong with David.   Semester 2, Week 7, Day 5.   Started reading to write Metaphysics Essay (4500 words).   Saturday.   Went to the dentist, had my teeth cleaned.  Very non-traumatic.  No fillings or anything (still).  I am so great.    Then went grocery shopping (at Bi-Lo, couldn't be bothered driving far) and came here (library).  Invention for the day: Extra arm and hand with about 20 fingers that will keep tabs of all the pages you want in those heavy books that just won't stay open by themselves.  A book duplicator would also be handy (yes I know we have photocopiers, but they're not the same).
