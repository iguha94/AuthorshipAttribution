         Dave's place again.  Still no speakers.  I forgot to mention yesterday that I borrowed two more books (apparently I now have 19 items on loan... I wonder what they are!):  Greek popular morality in the time of Plato and Aristotle,  K. J. Dover. Greek homosexuality,  K. J. Dover.  The one on homosexuality has got all these black and white pictures of Greek potter with very revealing paintings on them.  Giggle.  Some of them are VERY generous.   Semester 2, Week 6, Day 3.   Despite yesterday's protests, I read pretty much all today.  Although I did sleep in until 10:00.  (I stayed up late, watching Futurama on tv.)  I read a fair bit of  Greek Popular Morality  and the introduction of  Greek homosexuality  (plus flicking through the revealing pictures some more).  Then I read another chapter on Soble, starting at the last section and working forwards, but not the section I was supposed to read.  Finally, I read the section on Soble I was supposed to read yesterday for my synopsis and then wrote down some notes and I think it makes sense this time.  Then I came here.  I am about to go home, grab some fish gravel for Jeanie and her SCA stuff that's been in my room for ages (a month) and take it to her place and have a cup of TEA!  The fish gravel bit could be an adventure, I wonder what the garage is like....  Invention for the day: Small robot that can gather, sort, wash, dry and put away clothes.  Especially clothes that are not dirty, but aren't clean either and remain on your floor until they get worn again, get put away or become sufficiently dirty to wash (usually by me stepping on them enough).
