         Number of days until thesis draft is due: 13. Number of words: 9,631 Number of words in chuck out document: 3000+ Number of holes a truck could drive through: 0 (maybe a few) Number of holes pasta could be sivved through: lots - though some of those are just paranoia. Number of nights in a row I have had thesis dreams: 2.  How good do I feel about thesis: Pretty good, actually.   Semester 1, Week 6, Day 2.   There is only thesis... though at some point I'll do the reading for my other subjects!  Spent this morning writing arguments for Lucretius' account of love being the dignity and merit accounts of love.  I think I am reading to send it to people about now.  I am about to send it to Dirk.  Other things that need work:  Bibliography (yeah, I  meant  to do it as I went along...) Abstract (100-200 words that seems to be a conglomerate of your introduction and conclusion, but with an advertising twist that makes it sound more interesting than it actually is so that people will turn up and hear me present it.)  Thing that needs starting:  Oral presentation ("We do not talk about it." (look a Star Trek quote!!))  Will spend this afternoon at the physio for a bit.  Then work on other subjects/abstract/oral presentation.  Then singing.  Maybe (just maybe) more than one alto (me) will turn up this week.  Novel.  Invention for the day: Bread that keeps fresh indefinately (or at least for a week, then it can go green).  None of this inbetween going stale business.  This can be expanded to include other bread products and fruit.  (Milk has the right idea, either it's chunky or it flows.)
