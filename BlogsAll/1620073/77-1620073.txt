         Soon I will be 9497 days old (26 x 265 + 7)....  For some reason this is cause for celebration.  I realised that the last time my birthday was on a Saturday was when I turned 21 - I wasn't working then either.  I have come a long way, including having four birthdays at the same company (which had four different names....)  I am not really worried about getting older.  I think this is what happens to people who are unhappy with what they've achieved.  Some of what I have achieved (in no particular order):  Survived this long. Lived in a different state from the one I was born in. Lived in the country. Lived in a city. Learnt to drive. VCE. Graduated Bachelor of Computer Science. Fallen in love. Had my heart broken and recovered. Got into honours, twice. Started to learn Spanish, German, Mandarin and Ancient Greek (and now Italian). Been as far west as Perth and as far north as Bundaberg (have not been overseas). A bunch of kinky stuff that I shan't publish. Been so drunk that I considered not lifting my head to vomit. I have been concussed on numerous occasions (and only once because of David). Broken my colar bone (this is an achievement). Ridden more that 600km in nine days. Driven more that 6000km in two weeks by myself. Driven more than 12000km in twelve days with company. Rode a motorbike (for a bit) but then broke my arm. Learnt to ride a horse and galloped on a big white one along a beach. Moved out of home. Moved from Baronia Crescent, to York Ave, to Newlands Drive, to Barker Street, to Lillimur Road, to Dandenong Road, to Murdo Road, to Evelyn Street, to Panorama Street, to Greta Street, to Barkly Street, to Charles Street to my current street.  Yeah! Worked and studied. Was fired with 1.5 hours notice. Earnt more than my parents income combined. Earnt nothing. Discovered who I was, but then lost it and rediscovered who I was. Discovered who I was and decided I liked it.  So all in all, I've no cause to complain.
