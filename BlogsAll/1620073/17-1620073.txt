         Once again at Mel, Sascha and Ben's place.   Semester 2, Week 3, Day 5.   Last day of week three.  Have I done any work?  It doesn't seem like it.  If I'd done work, I'd be closer to the end of my work, but it seems like I'm still just as far away.  I have to write to summary of the key papers in my area.  That means I have to read (more than once) the key papers in my area, plus write something about them....  At least it doesn't have to be critical!  Last night I re-read Fiona's paper and made more notes.  Today I read:  2.5 articles of Soble's  Philosophy of Sex and Love . About 15 pages of Nussbaum (again) Some Lucretius of various bits, including an entire re-read of what he wrote on love.  But, is this enough?  I take comfort in what I learnt yesterday.  My fellow students (who are finishing this semester) have their first draught of their thesis due in three weeks.  At least two of them haven't started writing it yet.  But I would freak out if I was in that scenario.  One of the guys wrote his two essays in the last four days of semester.  That just seems wrong.  I couldn't right 9000 decent words in four days, no matter how much pre-reading I have done.  Went to uni and photocopied the Nussbaum paper, so I can scribble on it.  I feel more accomplished in an article when it has bits underlined and I've scibbled comments in the margin.  I don't think it's right to mark up library books.    Invention for the day:  Library books you can mark up, but as they pop through the Return Shute, all the markings disappear.  Yeah!
