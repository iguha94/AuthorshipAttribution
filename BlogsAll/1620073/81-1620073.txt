         Number of days until my thesis draft is due: 26.    Semester 1, Week 4, Day 3.    Woke up in state of panic.  Realised that if I wrote 500 words a day I should have about 13,000 words (which would mean I had chucked some, but chucking is inevitable at this point.)  Then realised that I was not going to work on it every single day (like Thursdays when I have classes and some days on the weekend), which means that I will have to write more words on some days to make up for it.  Finally realised that this was stupid, as already have a fair few words written (about 6 days worth) and could easily write 1500 words in a day if nothing else on and I've done the reading.  Spent the entire day writing my thesis (okay, I spent from 9:00 until 4:30 writing my thesis and I stopped at various stages to a) get a drink b) go to the loo from too many drinks or c) go to my room and bring out yet another book.   At some point around 11:30 I had toasted muffins with jam.)  Thesis is coming along okay.  It's coming together after my panic subsided.  Wrote a little Excel sheet to simulate what kind of marks I need to get an H1.  If I get 70% on my essays, I must get 90% on my thesis... that sort of thing.  Doing Italian homework now for class tomorrow.  So stuffed.  This is probably the most productive day I've had all year.  Invention for the day:  Small robot for getting books and drinks so I don't have to shift the laptop and go myself.  Will continue to go to the loo unassisted though.
