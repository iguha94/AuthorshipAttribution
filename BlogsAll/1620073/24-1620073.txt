          Thesis/Honours Update   I think things are going well.  In my meeting with Dirk, he said I could put some "scope justification" paragraphs around the arguments that I summarise in my synopsis, so this makes me feel better.    I have not done a lot for my course work subjects.  I do (most) of the reading for Metaphysics and have given up a bit on reading Kant for Aesthetics, but I am worried about writing essays for them.  Both of them require 4500 word essay around Week 13, but I am not sure exactly when they are due.  The Synsopis is due Monday, Week 7 and the other thing I have to do is a Literature Review, due Monday Week 13.  There is a week break towards the end of all this and I think that the coursework subjects only have 9 classes or so.  So it's still pretty good.  Under control.  I think Dirk is pretty impressed with the effort I've been putting into the thesis, but I keep jumping ahead, like, trying to get a topic and outline together when I should just be looking at what they are saying in the papers about Lucretius.  I canna help it!  Must learn how to walk before can run.... grasshopper!  I hope to spend tomorrow re-gigging my synopsis, then I can concentrate on Metaphysics, because I think I can knock over an essay there easier, plus I have a presentation in Week 7.  The only other immediate thing I have to do is re-read Brown's  Lucretius on Love and Sex   (just the juicy bits) because Dirk and I are meeting Tuesday at 10:00 to discuss.  He hasn't read it before.  Dirk hasn't done a lot with Lucretius, but I think he is just ace (Lucretius, that is.  Dirk is cool too.  The man knows way too much about dead Greek guys than can possibly be healthy.)  I am starting to feel a bit stressed, but it is under control.  It's certainly achievable.
