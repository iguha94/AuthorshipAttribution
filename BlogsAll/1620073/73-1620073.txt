         Here it is.  For all the world to see.  A snipet out of what I've been writing that sums it all up:   My Thesis  Lucretius theory of love encapsulates both the responsive and creative theories by acknowledging that the two camps are discussing two different aspects of love and are at cross-purposes.  Lucretius explores responsive love and shows how it can be sustained.  He also explores creative love and shows how it begins.  By acknowledging the two aspects of love in his theory, Lucretius can explain not only how love begins and endures, but also why there are two camps of philosophers who disagree.

(The honours co-ordinator, Toby, wants to meet with me to discuss my progress and any concerns/problems I might be having with my first draft.  I told him:  Concerns for a first draft are mostly to do with my continuing one-handed typist state. However, I also just need to get my ideas (of which I have many) and thoughts out (this is hampered by my slow and tedious typing).)
