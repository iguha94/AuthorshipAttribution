          Day before yesterday.   Number of naps: 4  Most miserable and nappy day.    Had 10 x-rays.  5 of each fist.  Was assured that x-rays would be at doctors by receptionist and nice x-ray chick.  Nice x-ray chick did make be pull a fist for an x-ray which was less nice.  Grumble.  Sat in the waiting room unravelling my bandage to take my cast off while watching  Opera . My life hit new heights as I walked home in the rain attempting to hold umbrella and bag with cast in it.   Yesterday.   Number of naps: 0  Played  Sim City 3000 .  Went to Chadstone.  It wasn't too busy.  Went to doctors.  The 10 x-rays I had were not at the doctors when I went, so they had to get a radiologist to fax a report to the doctors.  Grumble.  Good news was there was no fractures we didn't already know about.  The doctor has put my in a half cast, but to prevent my wrist twisting, it also covers my elbow.  My arm is bent like Barbie's.  Sigh.  This makes moving, sitting, sleeping, standing and walking so much more interesting.   Today.   Don't know.  Just had a nap.  Invention for the day:  Instantaneous transporter for x-ray photos in non-digital form (i.e. the originals.)
