         Number of days until thesis draft is due: 15. Amount of work left: lots. Number of holes in argument: Unknown.   Saturday.   Went and picked up Benji's new car.  Yay!  There were a lot of $50 notes flying around.  Drove up to Sassafras and had Devonshire tea and went to that neat Tea shop in the new car.  Drove back and picked up my car from the dealer (it was just parked there.)  Went to Jeanie's place for dinner - had very nice spuds with sstuff and pears with dumplings.  Went to Polly's graduation party.  Congrats to Polly.   Sunday.   So far, went to church and got a little palm cross for Palm Sunday.  In terrible pain, neck cramping and have headache (from neck).  Woke up in a bit of a panic about my thesis.  I am not seeing Dirk until Wednesday, he is not going to get a draft until quite late, which means he won't be able to read it, but I need time to work on it.  (And to do the reading for classes on Thursday.)  Feel very stressed.  Invention for the day: Small automatic sign that can sit above people's heads that informs people what not to ask.  E.g. "How's your thesis going?" and "What are you going to do after honours?"  (The answers are, "Oh, just fine" and "Graduate.")
