         I just had my final class for the semester.  Lucky me.  Dirk provided biscuits.  Spent last night at the Jeans' watching Delta Goodrem and Babylon 5.  In that order.   Semester 2, Week 13, Day 4.   Did not wake up at hour stupid because went to bed later.  Yay.  I think I have too many pillows.  Three seems excessive.  My head is only really on one....  Today's class was on the existence of numbers.  He called for his pipe and he called for his bowel and he called for his fiddlers three.  Russell:  He called for his fiddlers where fiddler a does not equal fidder b and fiddler a does not equal fiddler c and fiddler b does not equal fiddler c.  It's all very silly.  I have to go to Deakin to return the books I borrowed.  Then it's off to Chadstone to spend money I don't have.  My other plan for the day is seeing Jeanie (again, for the fourth night this week) to do circuit training (weights) with her.  Never done it before.  Should be sore tomorrow.  Hate my Aesthetics Essay with every fibre of my being and not working on it today.  Going to Chadstone.  Hmmph.  Invention for the day:  A web based enrolment system that works.  I tried to enrol in my thesis for next year, but it refused because I was already enrolled in it.  But I'm only enrolled in this half of it and not the next half.  Grumble.
