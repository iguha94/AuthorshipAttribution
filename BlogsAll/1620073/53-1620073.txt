         I bought a new bike!  Just a quick blog before I go ride my old bike....   Exam Period, Second Thursday.   Woke up at 12:30am and couldn't get back to sleep.  Slept from about 2am-5am.  I think I may have a problem....  Got up early.  Went to parents place.  Dad and I spent two hours at Invanhoe Cycles looking at bikes.  I bought one.  (I recommend Ivanhoe Cycles to anyone.  The lady there is REALLY great, she knows her stuff (she has four bikes) and knows girly things about bikes.  The fellas are also great.  Other people who have bought from Ivanhoe include my mum and David Golding and they'd probably say great things about them too.)  It's a Giant XtC3 with Hayes brakes, Shimano gears (lots and lots, possibly 27 (at least 24)) with a Deora (?) changy thing.  I.e. much better than current bike, bigger, lighter and better gears and brakes.  Got a touring saddle for the Great Vic Bike Ride.   Also got a pump (I know, I didn't have one before, I'm so ashamed), some drink bottles and holders and a new head thingy (bit what connects the frame to the handle bars, it needed to be shorted and higher for me.)  Because of the disk brakes, Dad has to teach me how to get it in and out of the car (have to take wheel off), so we put it in Dad's X-Trail and I will pick it up tomorrow.  Invention for the day: Giant XtC3s in purple.  Mine's red.
