         For sale: One styloid process of the ulna.  One female owner.  Low milage.  Recently involved in small accident.  Urgent sale, owner is losing her mind.   Recently   More of the same... few less snoozes.  My big news is that I have written thesis like words.  About 1500 of them.  My thesis topic is coming into creation.  When last asked what it was I responded:  "I am postulating that Lucretius is the true Avatar of Love and has a theory that is so original and has such great explanatory power that it has escaped the minds of philosophers throughout the ages.  (Yeah, something like that!)"  So don't ask.  It is now 7 weeks and 5 days since I broke my arm.  I am amazed at how it dominates every aspect of my life... even blogging.  Lesson for the day: If you think your underpants are much tighter than usual then check that you haven't put your waist through a leg hole.  Philosophical though for the day: If one can put one's waist through a leg hole, should one take comfort from this fact or be horrified.  Invention for the day: Hologram simulation of me that can go to parties so I can sit at home and feel sorry for myself some more.  All it would have to do is dance and wave at new people as they came in.
