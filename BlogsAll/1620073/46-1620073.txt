         No introduction.  Ner.   Rest of Saturday.   Shopped (as foretold).  Played the piano and polished my new shoes.  Polished my old shoes.  Polished my shoes that are falling to bits.  Washed polish off my hands.  Went to Jeans' place for tea and the went to Daniel's place with her.  Watched "Reefer Madness", well it was on while we talked.   Sunday.   Went to St Kilda for lunchies with David.  Chatted lots.  Then went into the city in an attempt to salvage his mobile phone because the screen has died, but they weren't open.  Went to Dave's parents' place for dinner.  Came home and busted Hannah writing her essay on my laptop (which has been on the coffee table in the lounge for the past fortnight).   Well done to her.   Semester 2, Week 11, Day 1.   Woke up at 6:00 with some ideas for my Lit Review and my Aesthetics essay.  Fell back asleep.  Went down to Dandenong where the nice man at the phone place broke Dave's phone screen, so he is getting it replaced.  I have lent Dave my phone, so I'm not contactable, except through my house phone.  This afternoon I have a peer edited class.  I read Jamie's thesis ages ago and marked it up.  I haven't looked at it since.  Eh.  I pity the poor person who looked at my Metaphysics essay.  I have changed it a fair bit since I handed it in.  Plan for the rest of the Semester:  1. Finish Lit Review (including discussing with Dirk how to tie my three ideas together.) 2. Finish Metaphysics essay (I was waiting on the feedback I am going to get today.) 3. Research and write Aesthetics essay. 4. Sleep.  Invention for the day:  A mobile phone with space to put a spare sim card so it can be kept safe while you lend you phone to someone.
