          Value Theory Class   Value Theory class was good, but only ran for an hour.  Jeanette has to write a paper in June about agents and value and stuff.  I have to read Velleman for next week (which I already did because I'm great and supremely organised.)  Agents are things that can act (as opposed to real estate agents or travel agents who (supposedly) act one your behalf.)  and it is thought that they are responsible (to varying degrees) and can think things through rationally.  Moral agents are those things that we hold accountable for their moral actions.  They may be all agents, or a subset of agents.  Agency certainly seems to vary in its degree.  For example, a fully cognitively capable adult is considered to have full agency, while people who are psychopaths, deranged, emotionally frail, mentally slow or under the age of 9 are generally (often) held to have lesser degrees of agency.  It seems that there is a relationship between being a capable agent and having a good life.  What is that relationship?  It also seems that there is a relationship between the capacity to have long term relationships, goals and desires and agency.  Why?  And why are these longer term things valuable anyway?   Thesis Update   I was wandering around the library (as one can only do when it is impossible to get access to a computer catalogue in early semester because all the first years have decided to check their hotmail on the catalogue computers...) trying to remember the Dewey Decimal System (128.4 Love, 170 Ethics, 306.7 Sex, 870.1 L Lucretius) when I came across a book by Haridas Chaudhuri  The Philosophy of Love .  Anyway, I have found my champion of agapic love!!  Yay!!  He gives a neat theory that aliken love to life.  Just as life cannot be reduced to lower order mechanical biology (though living things can), love cannot be reduced, just happends and creates value.
