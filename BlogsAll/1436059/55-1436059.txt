Some examples of the Gargoyle Form are Daedalus (Greek) and Mary Magdalene (Christian). The Gargoyle is associated with the concept of success, the number 4, and the element of wood. His sign is the new moon.  As a member of Form 4, you are a creative and resourceful individual.  You are always thinking of possible solutions to problems you face and you generally choose one that is right.
