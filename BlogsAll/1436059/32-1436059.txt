Positron -- You are the anti-matter equivalent of an electron. You are frentic and excitable like the electron, but you have an unpleasant personality and tend to destroy everything you come in contact with. On the bright side though, you are very cool. You like hanging out with Anti-Protons.       What kind of subatomic particle are you?     brought to you by   Quizilla    Heehee, that's kind of cute...
