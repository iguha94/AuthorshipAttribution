*Sigh*  I can't wait until Meghan leaves. She makes Psycho Brad seem really nice. Thats really hard to do, by the way. We're going to Six Flags tomorrow, which I really don't want to do. First, I've been there a gazillion times since we moved to Maryland, and after a while it just gets really old. No joke. Second, did you see the news around the last weekend of June? Dude! The Six Flags I've been to *so* many times was on the news because that damn Jokers Two Face ride got stuck with 28 people on it! Now, as cool as I think that is....I'd rather not take my chances with Six Flags' track record of failed rides.  I took all them quizzes Tea and Rosalie (with the accented 'i', I think) made. They're kinda fun when you're super super bored. Which I have been since school ended. All my friends are on vacation, damnit! Anyway, on to the quiz results:  Quiz #1, 'DotG Name Generator' By tea. Not far off from my actual character, except that her name is Jaedyn and she is not De Negacien.    My DotG name is Jaedyn de Negacien   Quiz #2, 'What Job Would You Have in Tortall?' by tea. This is a joke quiz, btw. We used it when Daughter Alessia gave the students a test to see what they would be when they grew up. Jaedyn wasn't happy to receive this result (but then again, who would be (don't answer that, please!)):       What Tortallan Career Would I Have?    Quiz #3, 'Which DotG Character Are You?' by Rosalie. Jaedyn wasn't included in this test, so I didn't get hers. Oh well. It was a nifty quiz!       What DotG Character am I?  By Rosalie   DUDE! Hillaron! Hell yes! He's the DotG charrie I am most like in real life. I am a pyromaniac. I love to experiment with explosive things...and then say it wasn't me! BOOM!  Ahem...anyways...
