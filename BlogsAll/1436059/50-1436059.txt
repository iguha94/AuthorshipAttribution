Hmmmm it's been a while.  Nothing is really going on.   On Monday the 17th we started the indoor track season. A lot of people came, almost a hundred kids. Over half of them were girls. Only seven or eight were freshmen girls. Jenn from soccer showed up, and of course Rabbits Foot. I wasn't worried about the size of our team. By Thursday only thirty girls were left. Granted that is more than the whole Cross-Country team ever was, everyone said that more people would give up by the first cold streak.  On Friday night I went to Kendra's for a sleepover. Rabbit was there, and two girls that I didn't know but were friends of Kendra's: Sam and Mariana. It was so much fun! We went to blockbuster in our pajamas (well,  I   was in my pajamas...) and it was so much fun. We watched movies all night and only slept for two or three hours. LoL.   Then on Saturday we went to the airport and took a flight to Minneapolis. IT WAS SNOWING!!! Whoot! Anyway, we ate dinner at my aunt's house, and drove on south to grandma and grandpa's. We were just there in July and my grandparents aren't doing so well since then. Grandpa fell and apparently it was really bad, and he can barely walk, and the doctors think that his eye problem might be a tumor. That, and his cancer...Grandma is starting to lose her pretty red hair from the chemo.   We just got back today, and it's all good. I have a lot of catching up to do, and none of it is for school. *grins*  I have a lot of posts to write up, a lot of people to talk to, and a whole new story idea to write up!   I love having a week of vacation though!
