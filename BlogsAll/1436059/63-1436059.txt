Listening to:  Requiem (The Fifth Symphony), TSO  Hmm...   Thursday    *Walking to the Track for practice*    Sarah:  You distance runners are psycho. Maybe I should do sprinting. Anyway, yesterday, we were running that loop and I kept thinking of the song Dori sings in Finding Nemo. "Just keep swimming, just keep swimming..."  Mallory:  ( mischievous look in eyes ) Reaaallllly....   Mallory:  ( Ten minutes later during warm-up run ) Just keep swimming, just keep swimming. What do we do? We swim...  Teammates Running By:  Uhh... Mallory?   Mallory:  ( Ten minutes later during stretches ) Just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, swimming, swimming...  Sarah:  ( Smacking herself in the head ) It's all my fault...   Friday    *5:30 AM, outside/inside M-dogg's (giggles) bedroom...*    Mother:  ( knocking ) Malloryyyyyyyyyyyyy.....  M-dogg:  Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?  Mother:  I have bad news.  M-dogg:  ( Into pillow ) Damn! ( To door ) We have school, don't we?  Mother:  I'm sorry, darling, there's no school today.  M-dogg:  ( grunting, wanting to throw the pillow at the door ) Then why are you waking me up at 5:30 AM?  Mother:  I love you too, dear. I'm going to work now!  M-dogg:  ( Uninterested snoring ensues )   Saturday    *At 9:30 AM*    Mallory:  ( Walking up the stairs and seeing 6 inches of snow outside the kitchen window)  YES! YES!
