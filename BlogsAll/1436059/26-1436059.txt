Whoot! I talked to Sarah today for about two minutes. I asked her if she knew what time and where on the 15th the soccer try-outs were. She didn't know, but she says she's gonna call and ask. I'll call Nora and see if she knows too, just in case she does...yeah. Anyways...Sarah had at least some good news! Since we both have last names that end in 'S' and are close together alphabetically, we'll be in the same homeroom in 9th grade! YAY! I didn't want to be stuck there with only Northies and no one I knew, so that's good. I signed up for Guitar 1, but I hope I don't get into it 'cause I'm afraid it will be too easy. But its also a good thing I signed up for it, 'cause its another class I might have with Sarah and since it will be really easy for me it'll be an easy pass class.  I watched the Pianist today. It was a sad movie. Awww. But Adrien Brody is kinda cute before he grows a beard in the movie, so I was happy. The Pianist is a very sad movie about a Jew in Warsaw, Poland during WWII, who plays the piano really really well. Sweet. He was about to get sent off to a concentration camp with his family, but his friend that was in the Jewish Police saved him and let him run away. So it was kinda like the Underground Railroad and the Pianist (I'm not sure what his first name was, it was Dutch or Polish or German or something...was it Broderick?) was shipped around in different houses by Anti-Nazi Polish people (that weren't Jewish). It was a very sad movie. Lots of dead people in it.
