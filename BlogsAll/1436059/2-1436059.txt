Update: Just got the new MB CD. Musically, I don't like it as much as the last one. The lyrics are still pretty good, but I just think overall the CD is too mellow. Or maybe I'm just judging it too quickly. Dunno, just dunno. +Shrugs+  Fave Songs on "Hotel Paper":  1) Are You Happy Now 2) Love Me Like That (Feat. Sheryl Crow) 3) Breathe 4) Tuesday Morning 5) Hotel Paper  I'd say about a three and a half out of five stars. Just not as good as the first album. It's pretty good though. Love the lyrics though. Thoughtful. I'll do better though when I'm famous *grins* I know ya'll will just love my CDs and buy a ton of them and listen to them over and over again, right?    "Breathe" by Michelle Branch   I've been driving for an hour Just talking to the rain You say I've been driving you crazy And that it's keeping you away  So just give me one good reason Tell me why I should stay 'Cause I don't wanna waste another moment In saying things we never meant to say  And I take it just a little bit I hold my breath and count to ten I've been waiting for a chance To let you in.  Chorus: If I just breathe Let it fill the space between I'll know everything is alright Breathe  Every little piece of me You'll see Everything is alright If I just breathe  Well its all so overrated In not saying how you feel So you end up watching chances fade And wondering what is real  And I give you just a little time I wonder if you realize That I've been waiting 'Till I see it in your eyes  Chorus  So I whisper in the dark Hoping that you'll hear me Do you hear me?  Chorus  Everything is alright if I just breathe I've been driving for an hour Just talking to the rain.
