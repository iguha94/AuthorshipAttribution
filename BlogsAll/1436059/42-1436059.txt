The Autumn Classic Invitational on the military base just ROCKED today.  Kate decided not to run since she's been 'sick' lately, though since she talked up a storm throughout the whole meet I don't think she was that ill. We could have beat Chesa. if she would have run, but we came super close and I did so well that I'm fifth on the Varsity team now.  Kendra and Tonie did really well, sticking together like glue through the whole course. Alex got back on Boys Varsity, and Trevor sucked so he's back on JV where he belongs (sorry, I love all the other boys but I'm just against Trev. Nah, just kidding Trev). David did really good. So did Kevin. Ah, Larry was in first for Varsity (first out of EVERYONE) until the last hundred-metres, which he should have sprinted...but I still think he could have beat that other dude.  Its all such a blur now. I wasn't nervous once the race started, and my legs were numb so I decided to push as hard as I possibly could. And it worked. Larry got an award and whatnot, like always. Our team did pretty well, all in all.   Such a feeling of companionship...not to mention the only co-ed sport for fall. *wink*. Nah, just kidding. I love all the boys. I love boys in general. The JV boys were running by and Kendra and I were screaming "We love you!" to all the OM guys that ran by. They laughed. So did we...  Oh, and when we got home the football game against Chesa. was going on, and we got to see the marching band! I had never seen it before, and I thought it was so incredibly cool! Their uniforms, mostly. Okay, our mascot is the Patriots, and they were walking - marching - down the way in Revolution uniforms with flutes and drums and trumpets and everything. POMS and cheerleading followed the serenading chorus, and thusly I got to see Heather, Lexi, Sarah, and Lara before their big performance. I'll see 'em all at homecoming game, but its nice to see people you don't see very often.  David stole my sandals.
