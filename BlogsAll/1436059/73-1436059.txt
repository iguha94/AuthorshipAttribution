I went to Peter Pan with Amanda this morning. The boy to played Peter was so cute! Awww. Thimble! Other than that and talking with Aman my day has pretty much really sucked. I got into another fight with my parents, which is typical but this time it was over something so stupid I can't even stand   myself  for it. GAH!!!!!!! I need a hug! *whimpers*  Anyway, I talked to Kevin for a while today. Like, an hour. That was hilarious. I'm not telling you what we talked about, because it was mostly just random crap but...it was funny! Then he invited me to chat and to my horror Corey was in there! He told me to leave and I told him to leave, and all in all it was pretty funny.   Hmmm. I spent a lot of time with my guitar on today. I was going insane with boredom, Keniesha was never online and Kendra disappeared on me. I wanted to sleep but I couldn't, no matter how much sleep I've lost over just this week. I wanted to work on my Creative Writing final story, but I was stuck on this one part where Beethoven first starts going deaf. So, I just hung out in my room doing nothing but playing on my guitar.  So today I didn't accomplish much at all. Nope. Tomorrow for Sunday School we're going for three hours from 5:30 to 8:30, because we're feeding the homeless people that are staying at our Parish. Eddie was talking about it in Government, and Melissa was all, "But I'm afraid of homeless people!" LoL. She is so goofy sometimes. Then on Monday I have the Puffy Paint Party. Fun. Then on Tuesday I'm going to die at the County Meet. I need support, so everyone pray for me Tuesday night and say out loud, "GO MALLORY" no matter where you are. Thank you, it is much appreciated. LoL.  I think I'll go back to being bored again. Actually, I'm talking to Sarah so it's not so bad.
