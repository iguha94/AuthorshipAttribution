Hmmm. Last night we had another meet. Sarah and Jenn did really well, they both got Personal Records. Keniesha went and told all her friends that she won the 300m dash when, technically, she didn't. Well, she did win her  heat  with her and two other people in it, but she didn't win the entire race. Either way she did pretty well, but I don't know if she got a PR (Personal Record) or not because she won't talk to me. She's been ignoring me lately and she won't tell me why. Anyway, I ran the two-mile again. I still did way better than my first race, but I didn't do as good as my race last week. So, I didn't get a PR, but I didn't do horribly. My dad took me home after my race, so I actually got to sleep some. Today we had no practice so it was all good.  Other than that, not a lot is happening. I'm writing behind-the-scenes like crazy on the BD, but I need to get back to actually posting, LoL. I'm working on a new game with Aman, which is incredibly fun but almost confusing just because it's really intricate. Then I have exams starting Friday, and I have English and Keyboarding this Friday. Cooool. But because it's exams I also get out two hours early, at 11:55. I probably have practice though. Grrr.  Keniesha is mad at me. I don't know why. I just don't understand her sometimes. She just makes everything into a joke. Well, scratch that...it just seems like she doesn't take anything I say seriously because whenever I talk to her about something I'm really being serious and honest about she laughs or smiles and doesn't even answer. Then she told Kendra something about Nora not liking her, which I really think is not Keniesha's business anyway, it's just gossip which sucks and I know it does. I need to talk to Rabbit but I don't know what to tell her other than that she needs to keep secrets secret and keep herself to herself and take things seriously when they need to be taken seriously.  Okay. I think I'm done now...
