Anyone who really knows me knows that I rarely think things through entirely. And yeah, I can hate till the bitter end, I hold some serious grudges to this day...dun dun dun. And I do act before I think, but is that so bad? Stubborn...          Take the   What High School Stereotype Are You?  quiz.  **Snorts** I really had no choice besides this.

Some people just don't deserve to be given a chance damnit...LoL.  I dyed my hair on Sunday morning. It only lasts 24 shampoos though. I used to have natural blond streaks near my face, while the rest of my hair was brown. Now, thanks to...nevermind, I can't remember the stupid brand of dye. Anyway, now my hair is chocolate brown instead of mousey brown, and those damn streaks turned wine red. Next time I'm either going for red or black...LoL.  Also on Sunday my old friend Chelsea came over with her mom and her sister Martea. She has changed a lot since she moved to Hawaii. A LOT. She's scary now. I know I have a lot of rocker or 'punk' buddies at school, but...she cuts herself...and she...she is suicidal. And her whole entire life revolves around anime characters (that are usually gay guys that look like girls). Chelsea is so different now...  SOCCER CAMP IS AWESOME! Its not one of thoses sissy and wussy camps. We get dirty, we sweat, we work hard...not to mention get a head start for the soccer tryouts for High School in a month. Its so freakin awesome. It goes from Monday-Friday and lasts from 8AM to 12PM. The ages allowed to go are from 9 to incoming 9th graders, but most of the kids there are incoming 9th graders. There are about 47 kids there, and only seven of the girls and fifteen of the boys are from South (my old Middle School). Most of them are the kids and siblings of kids from North (the other Middle School that is connected to my old Middle school...got it? LoL). We have mini-teams, each with four or five kids on them, and there are six boy mini teams and five girl mini-teams. I'm on girl mini-team five, which has a record of 0-0. Go Losers! Go us! Then there are big teams, with 8-10 people on them. There are two girls' big teams, each with 10 girls on them. They're called USA and China; I'm on USA. There are three boys' big teams, each with nine or so boys on them, called Brazil, Columbia, and Ukraine. Whichever boy team wins the tournament in their boy division goes against the girl division winner. Its awesome.  What else? Not much else, really. Seeya.
