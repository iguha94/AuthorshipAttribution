*Cries*  This was the last day of a lot of things. This was my very last day of Middle School chorus after three years. This was my last day of P.E. in Middle School after three years. This was my last day of Spanish w/ Señora Rivera, and my last day of Science with Mrs. Ward. Mrs. Ward said that she, Ms. Fecher, Mrs. Weigand, and Mrs. Malchester had come up with really cool categories for awards tomorrow. Cool. Mrs. Ward and Señora Rivera both said that our 8th grade class of 2003 was, out of all their years teaching, the classes filled with the most personalities. I have to believe them.   Daniel WILL win "Best Voice" because Mrs. Ward likes his voice...  *Cue Music*   We've come such a long long way Now the waiting is over We've shared our dreams And now it seems  That time...has slipped away  We leave you with a smile You're the ones who made it all worth while As we're walking down the aisle We leave you... With a smile  And now we near the end                           Near the end And say goodbye to all our friends There'll always be Sweet memories When we look back across the years  We leave you with a smile You're the ones who made it all worth while As we're walking down the aisle We leave you... With a smile  We leave you...with a smiiiiiiiiiiiiiiile     Feeling:  My leg hurts. And I'll miss Middle School.  Drinking:  The usual (Erm, water...duh)  Eating:  M&Ms  Listening to:  This guy on the history channel...he is talking about Theodore Roosevelt.  Reading:  My dad won't let me start reading another book. He wants me to save them for the trip to Grandma's since it will be a REALLY long drive from Maryland to Minnesota.  Writing:  Birthday cards.  Procrastinating:  Everything.
