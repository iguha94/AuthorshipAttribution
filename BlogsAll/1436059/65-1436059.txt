Blargh. Nothing really happened today. It's supposed to snow tonight and tomorrow morning so I'm really really really praying for no school, or at least a two hour late opening so I can sleep in.  Today in Algebra Mrs. M changed our seats. I sit behind some tall dude, I sit next to AMANDA and I sit in front of Cory....Then on our brain break I answered three trivia questions correctly and I got three lollipops. I gave the blueberry one to Amanda, the I-can't-remember-what-flavor-it-is to Jenny, and the mystery (he says it was Apple, no butterscotch...well, he couldn't decide) to Ryan.
