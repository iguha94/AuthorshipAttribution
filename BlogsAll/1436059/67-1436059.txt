Hmm. I ended up getting three days off of school and then tomorrow it's gonna be a two hour late opening. Sounds good, ne? Except I'm really worried about that last regular meet on Feb. 3. Because if we have school on Thursday, Friday, and Monday to complete Mid-Term Finals, then Tuesday and Wednesday will be the in-service workdays off. That means that with no school on Tues, we won't have a meet. They'll either cancel it entirely or postpone it. I need two more points to be Varsity. But if they cancel the meet than that would lower the number of points needed, since it goes by having an average of one point per meet. I can only pray.  I've done nothing more than write this whole three days. Oh, I slept and watched movies, too. Other than that...not much. Hmmm. I want to take pictures at the next Track meet. I've been scrapbooking everything.   I've been a little sad lately, too. I guess only Keniesha and Kendra know why, but I'm getting over something...or trying...teehee...but it sucks. Loving someone who doesn't love you back. It hurts. Please don't laugh at the sappy songs I add to this now!   I'd Rather Be in Love  I cannot help it I couldn't stop it if I tried The same old heartbeat Feels the emptiness I have inside And I've heard that you can't fight love So I won't complain 'Cause why would I stop the fire That keeps me going on  Turn out the lights now To see is to believe I just want you near me Just want you here with me And I'd give up everything Only for you It's the least that I could do  [Chorus] And when there's you I feel whole And there's no better  Feeling in the world But without you I'm alone And I'd rather be in love With you.  Why are we afraid to be in love To be loved I can't explain it I know it's tough To be loved  Okay, so I guess I need to study. *Sighs*
