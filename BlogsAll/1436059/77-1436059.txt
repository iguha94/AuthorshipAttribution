I spent my whole Saturday at the Armory Meet. I didn't have to be there, but I was an alternate for the 3200 Relay and Kendra didn't want to be the only person there to help write down the times of our teams and other teams. So I got up at 6AM and went to school, ready with my blanket and pillow for the long ride to the Baltimore Armory. It was, oh, about 8 degrees Fahrenheit (sp?) outside, and we got a damn cheese-bus (a regular school bus, not a nice coach bus)!!!   Anyway, the ride was about a half hour long, and when we got there we all got off the cheese and walked a few blocks to the entrance of the Armory, to be greeted by Army dudes with guns strapped to their hips and slung about their chests. Then we went in and found a little spot by the corner near the barracks area. There were thirty other schools there, some from MD, some not. But it was cool, all in all. It hurt my butt sitting on the hard ground taking down times, but I guess I'm kind of glad we went. The girls were close to getting a few medals, but they always got fourth place (when you needed third to get a medal) by a few tenths of a second. The guys, overall, got first place, and got a big bowl for a trophy. In any case, after Coach Ward put barbeque chips in the bowl on the bus, Littlejohn somehow broke the bowl from its stand and Coach Limaata wore the bowl upside-down as a hat.  That's basically my weekend. In other news, I wrote up a bio for another RPG (one that I was invited to join, and gladly accepted the offer) and 'unofficially' I am going to join forces (*evil laugh*) with an awesome writer with whom I've already had the pleasure to game, and all is well with the world...except that I have a four-page report due on the character Simon from "Lord of the Flies" including the analogy between him and Christ as saviors for the evils of mankind...something to that extent. Due tomorrow. And it's four-thirty in the afternoon...
