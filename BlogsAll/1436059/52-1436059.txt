What Song Are You?      brought to you by   Quizilla    *snickers*  Anyway -   On Saturday I woke up bright and early to go to the Girl's Gym lobby by 7am. Everyone on the team was there except for Katharina and Allison. The people running were Larry, Kate, and the Varsity boy's team. I guess Coach Lawton didn't want to hack up the cash for a nice coach bus for the STATE MEET, so we took a crappy yellow school bus. The ride was a little less than a hour, since we were going to that dreaded place that you might recall from a month and a half ago: HEREFORD! Y'know, the course that was perfectly fine and hilly except for that one "killer" ravine hill? Yeah, there.  It was freeeeeezing out! Kendra and I bought shirts, and then we got hot chocolate before going to watch the boy's 3A school race (we were 4A, so our boys didn't go yet). We went to the one hill, and to our relief, not one person fell during that race. Will Eden was supposed to win, but he got beat out at the last 100 metres. Poor Will. Then we waited around for a while and made David get us hotdogs (LOL!).   Then we ran back down/up that one hill to watch our boys run the 4A race. None of them fell, thank the Lord, and Larry did pretty well. He got fourth in the state, but he was disappointed in himself for not getting under seventeen minutes. Err, his time was 17:00:05, but whatever. That's about six or seven minutes better than my time! LoL. I just don't get Larry. Umm, Tommy and P Berry beat Pappas, and Pappas seemed really surprised about it afterwards. Other than that...yeah, nothing.  Then Kendra and I ran BACK down/up that one hill for the third time to watch the girl's 3A race. We were rooting for SP and Annapolis because they were the only teams we recognized from the season. Whoop Whoo.   Grrrrr. Then we went back down/up that one hill to watch Kate run in the girl's 4A race. Of course, Lauren C. from the Bruins was first place in that race. Her time was 19:01:01, and she beat most of the good  guys   that ran. I was happy for her though, and she deserved this because since she started running as a Freshman, she hasn't lost one race (or so I've heard). Good for Lauren. Kate was upset because she didn't do as well as she did last year. Ok, I don't get Kate sometimes either, since her time was good too, and at least she made it to states.  Then we went to the awards ceremony, and yada yada. Larry got fourth and got a medal and we left for home.   On Sunday I did nothing. On Monday I did nothing.  Today I started Book Two, finally!
