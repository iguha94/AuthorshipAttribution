I know its early in the morning, but I'm turning nocturnal these days so...I took a bunch of quizzes so I thought I'd post them here out of sheer and utter boredom.    Gray: You poor, depressed child. A rain cloud seems to follow you everywhere. The worst has always got to happen doesn't it? Life is miserable.   Made by  Sara         What color do you see the world in?     brought to you by   Quizilla    Oh, that makes me feel wonderful...    You were a brave knight, fighting for the king and dualing other knights in great battles. Perhaps you were a hero in your past life.       Who were you in your past life?     brought to you by   Quizilla    Ten bucks to the person who e-mails or sends me a PM first explaining that up there...    Big Grin; :-D  applaud my award-winning smile   This quiz was made by Sara (www.saradover.com)       What facial expression are you?     brought to you by   Quizilla    Oh dear Lord. I can think of several of my friends' reactions to this. Mom would show me a picture (or several) of me making a smile as big as the one up there. Dad and Brad and probably Jake and most likely most of the kids at school who know me would burst out in long fits of laughter. Heather would try pointing out the resemblances, and Hannah would say that's what I look like when I kick someone's ass at TKD.    Damsel in Distress: It's not your fault your always in the wrong place at the wrong time! But hey, the hero always saves you in the end and you live happily ever after.      Made by  Sara          Who do you play in in a typical movie?     brought to you by   Quizilla    Shit!  All I have to say now is....BWAHAHAHAHA!
