So we were at the Regional Cross Country Championships and...  Larry got first place for the boys race, and is thusly going to states this coming Saturday. Kate got sixth place for the girls race, and is thusly going to states this coming Saturday. The OM boys TEAM got sixth place by TWO POINTS, and is BARELY going to states this coming Saturday. The OM girls team got fourth place by TWENTY-THREE points (argh!) and is thusly NOT going to states. My season is over.   At least I beat Jessica.  Yeah, that's right. I kept cheering her on, telling her not to walk the hills, and those walked hills came back to haunt her when I sprinted the last three-hundred metres. I was flying, I swear. Not even bragging, either, because I am in no position to brag compared to Kate and Katharina, but I just   felt   like I was flying.   I feel so bad for Alex, though. Coach had to send in a roster of ten names, and that was the roster he could pick from for all the final meets (Counties, Regionals, and States). He forgot Alex. If your name wasn't on the roster, you don't get a tag. You haven't got a tag, you sure as hell aren't going to run. Colin would have been next in line, but he said that he "wasn't going if I'm not going to run." So, he would have actually ran if he had gone! Gasp. So, Chris K. had to run. Chris did pretty well.  We were all happy and cheering when the boys got to states. By two points. Coach had a look on his face that spelled out his complete disbelief, which confirms his unconfident manner with his team, and I knew he wanted to say (but didn't) "No (maybe the F word? Nah) way. No way."   Anyway, so my season is over. I still have to go to practice though. Argh. Oh well. Track is up soon.   I went to the Homecoming game today. I didn't really pay attention to the game that much but I know we won, only by like one touchdown. I love football, but not on the high school level. I was too busy hanging with Kendra, Marisa, and Robyn. I got to see Matt again, my old paper boy. He really is a nice guy, but I don't think he likes me at all, not even as a friend. Which I don't understand at all, because I was totally not mean to him in Middle School like SOME PEOPLE!  I need to lighten up, despite the fact that this week hasn't been the best week of my life. Some quizzes and happy sappy music will do me good for one night.               *insert notorious giggle here*        What Is Your Battle Cry?        Z ang! Who is that, running along the cliffs! It is  Guitargurlie , hands clutching a vorpal blade! And with a spectacular cry, her voice cometh:    "Brace yourself, oh human speck of dust! You are made of meat and I am very hungry!"

I taste like beef. I'm probably made of beef. You are what you eat, they say, and if the title didn't mean something else, I would be a beefeater. I think red meat is good for you. Puts hair on your chest.  What Flavour Are You?       LoL. Yeah, that's me. You know, I've heard people say that the diet of younggins SHOULD be 70% meat. Right? No? Well, I'm beef either way. My dad is a good cook. I mean, I did live in Scotland for four years, and I'm not allowed to donate blood because I might have mad cow disease. The nurse said so...then again my nurse moved to Israel to become a on-site medic...    I adopted          Jarrat Mason  the town warden  and      Joan Palmer  the town walker    from   Shiver my Timber    Tea, you rock.             Which pirate are you?     Great way to die, eh?
