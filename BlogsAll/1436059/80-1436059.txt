2004! So far, so good.    *HUGS* TOTAL!   give guitargurlie more *HUGS*      Get hugs of your own    Hugs? Anyone?  Tonight we're going out to dinner for mommy's birthday. Fun. She unwrapped all her gifts. We (Shelby and I) gave her stuff from Bath and Body Works. Not quite personal in any way, IMHO, but she loved them and that's all that matters.   Argh, it's finally hitting me that school starts Monday and Exams are at the end of the month. We have such a messed up schedule for exams. Well, not really, but I hate exams so I'm just going to diss them anyway. Here's the schedule:   Friday, January 23   7:17 – 7:30       Pd 1 – Attendance and Announcements   7:35 – 9:35        Period 1 A Day Exam    9:40 – 9:50       Break   9:50 – 11:50      Period 2 A Day Exam    11:50 – 11:55   Announcements       Monday, January 26  7:17 – 7:30       Pd 1 – Attendance and Announcements   7:35 – 9:35        Period 3 A Day Exam    9:40 – 9:50       Break   9:50 – 11:50      Period 4 A Day Exam    11:50 – 11:55   Announcements      Tuesday, January 27  7:17 – 7:30       Pd 1 – Attendance and Announcements   7:35 – 9:35        Period 1 B Day Exam    9:40 – 9:50       Break   9:50 – 11:50      Period 2 B Day Exam    11:50 – 11:55   Announcements       Wednesday, January 28  7:17 – 7:30       Pd 1 – Attendance and Announcements   7:35 – 9:35        Period 3 B Day Exam    9:40 – 9:50       Break   9:50 – 11:50      Period 4 B Day Exam    11:50 – 11:55   Announcements   Yep. Then we get Thursday and Friday off to wallow in our self-pity, and convince ourselves to think the worst (that we failed) and hope for the best (that we pass and get the credit). At least on those days we're getting out two hours early! I hope we don't have track practice those days too, but we probably do since the Regionals and States are two and three weeks after the tests. I dunno.  Anyway, give me hugs! I hope all the rest of you High School and College students do well on your Mid-Term exams! Good luck!   Oh, right. HAPPY NEW YEAR!
