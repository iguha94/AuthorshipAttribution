Things are cooling off, but I still feel like crap. **works on finishing a Tapestry post**  I have to do ticket-selling duty tomorrow, but I like that lunch so maybe I switch to C lunch on B-days for selling tickets. The damned awkward silences today were terrifying. I should have just sat with Sarah and Courtney, but I wanted to at least try saying  something,   anything  to Amanda, but then the look on her face made me change my mind.   **a lot has been edited because I've calmed down**  Besides that, at track today I found out what I'll be running. The two-mile didn't surprise me, but the open 800!?!?! That was a shocker. They're getting all these sprinters to run the 4x8. Well, there ya go. Life sucks sometimes, but it's not gonna kill me (though I know some people wish it would).   Keniesha wouldn't look me in the face, wouldn't nod acknowledgement, wouldn't say a word. *shrug* I guess she's still mad at me too. Other than her and Amanda, none of my other friends are pissed off at me, I don't think. ;-)  All this crap all at once.  I wish I could say that something good happened today, but not really. Three days till meet, four to surgery. Mom is a million miles away and she hasn't called yet. My grandmother was put in the hospital for two nights...I dunno. The worst part about that is that my dad can't leave while my mom is gone.   **edited again because I've calmed down**  Again, this song is so strangely there...   I'm full of regret  For all the things that I have done and said  And I don't know  If it will ever be okay to show  My face 'round here  Sometimes I wonder if I disappear   Would you ever turn your head and look  See if I'm gone, 'Cause I fear  There is nothing left to say to you  That you wanna hear,  That you wanna know...  I think I should go  The things I've done are way to shameful...    Awwwwwwwwww...........ARGGGGGGGG..........*bangs head on wall* I AM SO STUPID!!!
