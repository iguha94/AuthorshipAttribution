HAH! NO SCHOOL!   My mom woke me up this morning at 5:30 and said she had bad news. I was like, "We have school, don't we?" and she said, "No, there's no school." I was so happy! Then I went back to bed and didn't wake up until 7:30, and even then I just went upstairs to see the snow and go sleep on the couch. I feel so rested, and not only that, but on Monday it's a B DAY again! YES!!! I'm so glad we had no school today. THANK YOU, SNOW!!!  I'm going to be catching up on posts today, since I'm really behind. LoL. Umm, not much else really. I still haven't finished chapter one, and it really sucks because I know what I want to type down but I just can't! Grrr...  Anyway...

Which Lord of the Rings character and personality problem are you?     brought to you by   Quizilla    Hah! That's so me. Ask anyone. I can even SEE the cloud above my head. HAH! Then I went back and purposely got this result:    Congratulations! You're Elrond!       Which Lord of the Rings character and personality problem are you?     brought to you by   Quizilla    Because I think they speak for everyone when they say, "Even though we won't miss her," or something to that extent. Anyway, PMS is a good excuse for Elrond anyway. *giggles*       What is your past life? How did you die? by    whisperinghope        Name           Age           Way    In sleep, peacefully.
