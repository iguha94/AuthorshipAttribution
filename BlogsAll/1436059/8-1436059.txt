Hey! Yesterday BW gave me a Personal Title! What do you think about " The Melody of Misery "? Cool, huh?   Still. Finals are this week and next. That sucks. We got yearbooks on Monday though, so I'm happy. About half of the 8th grade has signed mine, and a few sixth graders and I think one seventh grader. I don't like sevies so that's okay.   We had a fire drill during 8th period, then we also had a locker clean-out in the same class. And we also had to send someone to go get Newsletters during...you guessed it, the same class. The locker clean out was good for me at least because I swear I haven't seen the bottom of my locker since August. There was a whole binder down there that I haven't used since October. Weird.   Ugh. Season signed Heather's YB. She wrote (direct quote):   Hey Heather! It was nice getting to know you! Stay nice! Keep this autograph for when I am famous! ~Season!   Yeah. Uh-huh. Well, yesterday after school, I heard that Clayton threw a pencil at Season that was full of wet glue and it got stuck in her hair. Heather said she was fussing about it for the rest of the Spanish Review. I wish I had stayed after to see it!   Mrs. Fetcher still hasn't given back our Sci-Fi/Fantasy short stories yet. I want to see what grade I got. It was about a pirate who attacks her hometown because the people used to make fun of her because her magic was the ability to smell Quality Cheese and tell when someone last washed his or her socks. But (obviously, its so cliche) the heroines save the day by thinking of a clever way to divert and in then end, kill the pirate.  Cool, huh?   Feeling:  Right now, I feel like writing. And editing, can't forget editing. I also feel tired. I always feel tired. I never sleep. (  Drinking:  Water (I know, I'm getting so predictable)  Eating:  Pringles.  Listening to:  I'd Rather Be in Love, By Michelle Branch.  Reading:  Abhorsen by Garth Nix.  Writing:  Music.  Procrastinating:  Sleeping.
