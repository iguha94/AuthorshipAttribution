Anyway, today was Monday. Monday sucks. I had my first Carpentry class today with Mr. Bury. He's kind of a geeky guy who's really timid. There were only nine of us...he gave each of us a piece of dry wall and a glomp of spakel (sp?) and we drew with the spakel stuff. It was fun.  In gym we played basketball and soccer. It was loads of fun but only because Sarah's class was allowed to come over into Team Sports. How come I made it into Team Sports but Sarah didn't? She signed up for it and all. Whatever. Hmmm....  Government sucked arse today. I'm not even joking either. Out of six classes, only one person got an A on his Final. Only five people got Bs or Cs. Yeah, that means that 90% of us got Ds and Es. And I was one of them! I got a D! I was upset, I wanted at least a C because I have an A in the class. So I wanted a C or higher on the test because I would at least get a B in the class then, but now, how does that D on the test weigh out my A? I was upset but honestly I wasn't that surprised.  In English we talked about sonnets again. We read the famous Sonnet 18, "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" Then we read a sonnet about a gay love slave...Shakespeare was a strange, strange man, even though he was brilliant. I got to talk to Amanda and Coooory.  Finally tomorrow I get to go to A-day. I have theatre arts and Spanish, but that's all I'm looking forward to. Nick and Cory are in my Algebra class, so that's good, but there are some not-so-good people in that class too. People who hate me, and I hate them, so we're all one big happy hate-fest. I don't even know why we hate each other. Some people are just really prissy and bitchy sometimes. Anyway, at least Amanda said she was in that class, and hopefully Andy, Brad, Ryan, and Jenny will be in there too because I haven't seen them lately.   Tomorrow is the last Indoor meet! Whoop! I'm running the two-mile. It's at the armory though, and I haven't run there yet. Full of army dudes, and I'm a navy brat. Teehee. Lalalalala. I'm going to go write a sonnet for homework....funfunfunfunfunfun....
