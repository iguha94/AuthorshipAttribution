Oh Lord so much has happened in the last week!  On Monday the fifteenth Grandpa Bernie died in the home that they'd put him in three days previous. He was 81 years, 11 months, and 21 days old. He died while I was at school running track. Thank God we went to visit during Thanksgiving and not for Christmas break, or we would have missed seeing him by a mere week or so. I miss him so much! Oh God it's so hard to think that I'll never see him again! It's so hard, but thanks to all my friends and acquaintances, the pain isn't nearly as hard to bear as it could have been. Everyone is so supportive! I love ya'll!  Not much happened on Tuesday.  Holy crap (it sounds so vulgar, I know, but this is sooooo weird!). On Wednesday I go into third period Biology and it's business as usual until 11:55 when our D lunch bell was supposed to ring. Well, it was supposed to ring...but, well...it didn't. Then the Principal comes on the announcements and blares out: "NO ONE HAS BEEN HURT, I ASSURE YOU!" and then his voice calms down and he doesn't explain why anyone would be hurt in the first place, and insteads decided to explain that police have surrounded the High school and two connected Middle schools and, alas, that everyone would stay in their third period classes. This means that the C lunch kids were stuck in perpetual lunch-ness while we poor, deprived Science hall students were to get no lunch.  12:00 ticks by, and Mrs. McC pops in the DVD "Finding Nemo".  12:30 ticks by, and Principal comes on the announcements just to reassure that despite the fact that we have NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON....no one has been hurt. 1:00 ticks by, and all the tenth graders in the class that failed last year start complaining that they're hungry and that a movie about fish does nothing to help. 1:15 ticks by, and Mrs. McC goes to the bathroom, and everyone gets pissed because they're not allowed to go to the bathroom. 1:30 ticks by, and Finding Nemo starts winding down. 1:55 ticks by, and Principal comes on the PA system and says that he sent a letter for the students to bring home and that students will be dismissed shortly. 2:15 ticks by, and the students are let out of the classroom twenty minutes later than their usual school-ending time.   We were only allowed out of two exits, and the police only searched boys with ski caps and baggy clothing. No one was allowed anywhere on the bottom floor after dismissal without a teacher unless they were going to the exits. Thusly I was not allowed to get my WINTER COAT. Grrr. All after school activities were canceled. I go outside without a letter since Mrs. McC forgot to give us ours. And, with my incredible luck, it's pouring outside and my bus isn't there.  The buses started leaving, and my bus and one other bus had yet to arrive. Again, with the apparant occulation of any luck I once (or [n]ever) had, it began to hail outside. And I with my simple long-sleeved T-shirt on. 2:30 and my bus still hasn't showed up. IT STARTED TO SNOW. Yes, snow. Then my bus showed up at 2:45.   I found out more about the 'incident' on the 4 and 5 o'clock news than I did from our dear old Principal. Apparantly some student smuggled a gun into school and shot it in the gym hallway. I guess NO ONE WAS HURT, as Mr. L kept on insisting over the PA. And, for a news update: the boy who brought the gun to school was apparantly caught while I was in Minnesota. Yay.  We had to delay our flight for MN from Thursday night to Friday morning. EARLY Friday morning. So I wake up at four AM on Fri. morning to catch the flight. Black clothing in tow, I was met with about half an airport full of US Army dudes and dudettes going home for the holidays. I was filled with some kind of pride that only the sight of one Army guy being chastised by my retired Senior Chief in the Navy mother for putting his bag over his shoulder when wearing his dress uniform.   Friday was the wake. It was incredibly sad. So much sadder than I'd anticipated. I couldn't go up to the open casket. I couldn't. Aunt Sondra said she'd go with me if I wanted her to, but I didn't think I could. Then Jovana took me up there, and I couldn't bear it. His face....it was so....sunken in....  Anyway...  Saturday was the funeral. I said goodbye to grandpa and the service was very nice. Jo said a poem and Uncle Gary spoke during the commentation time. They played Amazing Grace.   The rest of Saturday and Sunday was spent visiting with family. We got home today at 5:30. I was so happy to be home. Now apparantly I have track practice tomorrow at 8:30 AM and I need to find a ride home since my mom can drive me there but not back.   Christmas is in two days, I think. Oh and on Christmas-Eve-Day I'm going with my dad and Jett Robb (LoL) to see Return of the King. Oh God I've wanted to see it for so long but it's been such a busy week. Then I'll go to Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve since that's the one with the candles, and then it will be Christmas Morning!  Oh, but how I wish it was that simple.    You are a freeform writer. Individualistic with a sense for the different and challenging, Walt Whitman and his poetry lacking meter and rhyme is just what the doctor ordered. You're quick to write something that the rest of the world doesn't accept as poetry, quick to separate yourself from the average joe. An author with a true sense of self, you have confidence in your abilities and aren't afraid to show it. :) GO YOU!
