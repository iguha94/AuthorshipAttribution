wants to huggle      DotG Random Hookups    Jaedyn is my character in DOTG. Those nifty avatar things were made by TEA the same person who made the ever-popular FUZZIES! THANK YOU TEA.  *Ahem* Well, not much has happened. Today was the first day of early dismissals. Only two days left of school. I passed all my finals! WHOOT! I got a B on science w/ an 88%, but the scantron thing screwed up so I actually have about a ninety-two, but Mrs. Ward only changed the Exam grade of people where it would've affected their final grade. I had an 85 on my Spanish final, which is a LOT better than I thought I would do...but Señora Rivera curved it since so many people were one point from passing and thus I have a 89.5, to be raised by the MUY INTELLIJENTE Y SIMPATICA Señora Rivera. All the rest were A's of different degrees, and despite the fact that I about killed myself studying for Science, I'm pretty happy.  Finished Abhorsen by Garth Nix. Everyone said it wasn't as good as Sabriel, but I thought all three of them were awesome. In order of most favorite to least:  1) Sabriel (1st in the series) 2) Abhorsen (3rd in the series) 3) Lirael (2nd in the series)  Good books.
