*Sighs* Damn, its August already. Tomorrow is Emmie's and Katie's birthdays, so HAPPY EARLY B-DAY!! I just love birthdays. Yeah and I was invited to this seven-year old's birthday party tomorrow, but I have rehearsal with JemJem and meesh so I can't go. But I got her a present and I'll give it to her on Monday at Karate I guess.   Less than a month until school. OMHS really isn't that big, but there are a lot of people who're gonna be there so I guess it might look/seem different since I saw it when it was empty. Most of the classes are in a certain hallway, depending on their subject. So, all I have to do is figure out where the hell my class will be in the hallway. I'm not nervous, either. Its gonna be fun. New place, new people, new ways to get in trouble...yeah.   Today I watched Braveheart, 'cause I was really really bored. Its a cool movie, and I love the way Mel Gibson says 'arse' with his Scottish accent. Mom says we're going back to Scotland next year and we'll visit uncle Joe in London sometime. Cool. Can't wait. I mean, I'd much rather go to Scotland than the Carribean.   Nothing much else is going on, really.    Feeling:  Bored.   Drinking:  Water, of course.   Eating:  Brad has eaten all the good food already. Stupid bugger.  Listening to:  Scottish accents.  Reading:  Nothing really.  Writing:  Chapter Seven.  Procrastinating:  Nothing that I can think of right now. Let me get back to you on that.
