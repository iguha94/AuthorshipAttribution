There are few words grand enough to describe the TSO concert. In fact, I must insist that everyone reading go out on a whim and buy tickets NOW. I can say no more than it is rock meets Bach and that you will LOVE IT. Go, NOW.  Anyway...    As if you were born into a world of tears, you always tend to look at the darker things in life.

Nawat Crow used to be a real crow... a crow that was very curious about humans. Once he met Alianne he transformed into a human to help her on her quest.
