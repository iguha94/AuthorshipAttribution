Evanescence rocks my world.   Okay, so maybe thats a little much, but hey, Amy Lee kicks ass. She represents the kind of person I want to be...successful and awesome without being a slut like Britney Spears. Amy doesn't need to stoop down to Britney's level (stripping and dressing like she can't afford extra fabric) to be successful and Amy is the best. Her voice is so beautiful even if she is screaming out. I've been a fan of Evanescence since before their album Origin came out, and I'm so glad they made it and Amy and Ben are doing what they were born to do.     Missing by Evanescence   Please, please forgive me, But I won't be home again. Maybe someday you'll have woken up, And barely conscious, you'll say to no one: "Isn't something missing?"  You won't cry for my absence, I know - You forgot me long ago. Am I that unimportant...? Am I so insignificant...? Isn't something missing? Isn't someone missing me?  [Chorus] Even though I'd be sacrificed, You won't try for me, not now. Though I'd die to know you love me, I'm all alone. It's too late now. Isn't someone missing me?  Please, please forgive me, I won't be home again. I know what you do to yourself, Shudder deep and cry out: "Isn't something missing? Isn't someone missing me?"  [Chorus]  And if I bleed, I'll bleed, Knowing you don't care. And if I sleep just to dream of you And wake without you there, Isn't something missing? Isn't something...  [Chorus]
