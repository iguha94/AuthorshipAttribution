AHHHH!! The meet was so awesome! It was so cool! Hehehehehe!  So I get to school this morning, and go to the North end to give a nice good-morning to Kendra, Andy, Ryan, and Jenny and Hopper. Then I took my chicken breasts (LoL!) to Se√±orita Sharrer's room. She told me I was awesome because Matt didn't bring his chicken boobs. ;-)  Then I went back downstairs and said good-morning to everyone in the locker room when I put my track stuff down there. Then it was time to go to Theatre Arts. It was a thoroughly and completely uneventful class. We recited the memories that had been randomly passed back to us, nameless. I had Tiffany's memory, which was incredibly sad and depressing. I know my memory was happy, but the gothic chick who had mine wasn't there (as usual).  In Spanish I helped cook the Paella! Yay! It was so awesome!  WHOA! In math we had a really freaky substitute. She was like, permanently PMSing or something, 'cause she was really, really bizzotchy. Ha! She read my name and pronounced it so wrong! She goes, "Maaaah - Lair - eee?" and I totally wondered how she got that from Mall o ry. I dunno, she was seriously weird and psycho about the test we were taking too...whoa...  Biology was stupid.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! THE MEET ROCKED SO HARDCORE!!! IT WAS SO AWESOME! It was at Chesapeake, and it was us, Chesapeake, Arundel, and Northeast. Girls and boys got first place! And guess what? GUESS!!!  I GOT THIRD IN THE MILE!! THIRD PLACE!!! And I got SECOND in the half-mile!!! I WAS SO HAPPY!!! I have enough points to get my varsity letter, and it's only the second meet of the season. Whoa! Hahaha! I got a Personal Record on my mile, and I think the 800 got me a PR too. YAY!   SOY AMADA!!!!
