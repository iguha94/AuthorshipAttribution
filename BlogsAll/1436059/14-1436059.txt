Hey! Not much has been going on. Still sick of Meghan but she is leaving on Thursday so its all good. I asked some of my friends (Jake, Jem, and meesh) to fill out this quiz about me. They had to agree on everything. I got this from somewhere...can't remember. I told them I'd fill it out for them later. You're supposed to put percentages of how much you are of that adjective. It doesn't all have to add up to 100% in the end, 'cause there are too many adj. for that, but each adj. has to be ranging from 0-100%. This is what they all put for me:   Wild: 55%  Crazy: 60%  Loveable: 89%  Funny: 90%  Annoying: 40% (After this adj. Jake wrote "Only on some days...")  Psycho: 99% (JemJem said that this isn't always such a bad thing, but I dunno...)  Daring: 50%  Friendly: 75%  Argumentative: 95%  Patient: 0%  Determined: 85%  Creative: 90%  Optimistic: 35%  Happy: 35%  Intelligent: 85%  Bossy: 20% (meesh wrote: "that is your cousin Meghan's job right now...")  Beautiful: Okay, on this one I got two different percentages. Jake put 80%. JemJem and meesh put 75% in a best friend sort of way.   Critical: 65%  Outgoing: 80%  Athletic: 90%  Superstitious: 15%  Curious: 45%  Moody: 67%  Loud: 83%  Passionate: 52%  Obsessive: 40%  Eccentric: 75%  Arrogant: 59% (Gee, thanks JemJem... ;-> )  Studious: 80%  Honest: 67%  Open-Minded: 45%  Talented: 90%  Enthusiastic: 85%  Lively/Active: 75%  Popular: 65%  Chaotic: 100%  Realistic: 85%  Rebellious: 85%  Energetic: 50%  Rough/Tough: 85% (Jake reminds me at this point what Hannah says she thought when she first met me. We were at Karate, and it was back when she was a Black belt and I was just a Red. We were about to spar and Hannah thought "Oh shit. She's gonna kick my ass like she did to that other boy!")  Clumsy: 50%  Spontaneous: 87%  Talkative: 86%  Strong: 75%  Reliable/Loyal: 90%  Independent: 90%  Bright/Bubbly: 60%  Self-Conscious: 70%  Idealistic: 90%  Sarcastic: 85%  Child-like: 60%  Yes, now I see my friend's true colors...
