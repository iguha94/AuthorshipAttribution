I've been feeling like serious crap since the weekend started. I haven't gone anywhere at all. I just don't feel good, I feel lethargic. Amanda came over yesterday, but other than that...nothing. I hate it, but I just don't want to do anything. The only productive things I've done all weekend was sleep, play guitar, fold laundry, and study. Pathetic.   Mom and Dad say there's a huge chance that there won't be any school tomorrow. That's good. Really good. That gives me an extra day to study and not worry about the Government final. So, yes, I really want snow.   Quizzesssssssss.

Alrighty then...       What in a cemetery are you ? by   FictionalVixen .    Okay, that sounds a bit like me...Kind of...Anyway, the next result had a bit of an inappropriate picture. You've been warned!    You are a  PHOENIX  in your soul and your wings make a statement. Huge and born of flame, they burn with light and power and rebirth. Ashes fall from your wingtips. You are an amazingly strong person. You survive, even flourish in adversity and hardship. A firm believer in the phrase, 'Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger,' you rarely fear failure. You know that any mistake you make will teach you more about yourself and allow you to 'rise from the ashes' as a still greater being. Because of this, you rarely make the same mistake twice, and are not among the most forgiving people. You're extremely powerful and wise, and are capable of fierce pride, passion, and anger. Perhaps you're this way because you were forced to survive a rough childhood. Or maybe you just have a strong grasp on reality and know that life is tough and the world is cruel, and it takes strength and independence to survive it. And independence is your strongest point - you may care for others, and even depend on them...but when it comes right down to it, the only one you need is yourself. Thus you trust your own intuition, and rely on a mind almost as brilliant as the fire of your wings to guide you.You are eternal and because you have a strong sense of who and what you are, no one can control your heart or mind, or even really influence your thinking. A symbol of rebirth and renewal, you tend to be a very spiritual person with a serious mind - never acting immature and harboring a superior disgust of those who do. Likewise, humanity's stupidity and tendency to want others to solve their problems for them frustrates you endlessly. Though you can be stubborn, outspoken, and haughty, I admire you greatly.       *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by   Quizilla    Sounds painfully familiar.
