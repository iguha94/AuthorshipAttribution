No school today!   I woke up at 5:30 to take my shower or go back to bed if it was canceled, and my mom said that they hadn't decided! They'd decided to close every other county, but ours couldn't make up their mind! I mean, hey, there was only like a foot of snow on the ground! I think it was some serious bull that they couldn't decide, considering that people need to get to their buses at 6:30, they should decide by five so people can get ready! Then I slept till six and my dad called to say there was no school.  Then I slept till nine, watched TV until ten, and here I am. Watching the snow fall, writing, and studying. Okay, well I'm not  really  studying, but it's encouraging to say that I am.   I dunno. I feel like going ice skating. Maybe I could call Kendra and Keniesha and go ice skating with them. Or have a snowball fight, but then again I don't feel like putting on a bunch of snow clothes stuff.   Have you ever met someone who liked to say they were the best at everything? Someone who also owned the best of everything? In short, someone PERFECT? Or, someone who liked to pretend to be perfect? Man, it sucks. Maybe I'm just jealous. Maybe. No! I'm never jealous! I'm perfect! No, wait...that made no sense...oh well. Nevermind.  I haven't run in almost a week. It sucks. Especially since I need to win that meet on the third of February to get my letter. I guess we don't have practice today though...teehee...
