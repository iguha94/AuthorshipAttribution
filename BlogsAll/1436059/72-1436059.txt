First of all, this year's playoffs were a serious disappointment. Patriots and Panthers *rolls eyes* Well, you can't get a good match every year. What really disappointed me though was that my team lost to a team that they could've beat, with a play they decided not to run. Oh well, there's always next year. I guess I'm rooting for the Panthers.  Anyway, we had the Puffy Paint Party! We went to practice and did a free run for a while, and then when we came back to get our stuff we went to the track and we all carpooled to Coach Nelson's house. The guys all went to IHOP for a breakfast as their party thing, since we came up with the wonderful paint party idea. My shirt is okay but it does look kind of...weird. I need to wear a shirt under it because I cut & beaded the sleeves red, white, and blue.  I also got my Secret Spirit stuff yesterday for Jenn, since she's the name I pulled out. Not that it stayed secret for long...but I still don't know who has me so I guess it is still kind of secret. Tomorrow morning we're all going to meet in the locker room and exchange gifts. Fun fun fun. Then that night we're going to run. I'm still running the two mile race *sighs*. I always get nervous before a race.   So, the last three days of the first Semester. Then most of or all of my classes will change. I will miss Creative Writing so much. That's like my favorite class. Technically, we do have homework in it, but it comes so easily to me that it doesn't feel like homework. I hope I have all the same people in my classes though. I wouldn't mind changing Government and Algebra teachers, and I'm really glad that keyboarding is only a one Semester class cause  that class is really boring.   Then again this also means that exams are only a few days away...FRIDAY. EEEE! At least the two classes for Friday exams will be easy...English and Keyboarding. Then over the weekend I'll hold a cram study session for all the hard classes next week.  + I _____ Mallory + Mallory is _____  + If I were alone in a room with Mallory, I would _____ + I think Mallory should become a _____ + Mallory needs ______ + Someday Mallory will _____ + Mallory reminds me of _____ + Without Mallory I ______ + Memories of Mallory are ______ + Mallory can be ______ + Worst thing about Mallory is ______  + Best thing about Mallory is _______  Keniesha, you better fill this out and email me!
