I wanted you to know, That I love the way you laugh. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away... I keep your photograph,  And I know it serves me well. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain --  Because I'm broken When I'm lonesome! And I don't feel right when you're gone, away...  The worst is over is now, And we can breathe again! I wanna hold you high and steal thy pain, away There's so much left to learn, And no one left to find. I wanna hold you high and steal your pain.  Because I'm broken, When I'm lost... And I don't feel right.  Am I strong enough? 'Cause I'm broken, When I'm lonesome... And I don't feel right -- When you're gone, away...   This weekend has seemed so long. I guess I should be glad, but I don't know anymore. I'm so bored. Not really bored, actually, more like aimless and unsure. I've been going through all these old documents on my computer, some of them are so old and some of them are rather embarrassing songs and stories from ages ago. I don't know. Old digital photographs, old tales of heroes and old virtues that no longer exist in the modern day. It's so funny sometimes, that I used to wish that people were like the characters in my stories and songs and poems. Oh well. Dreams are crushed sometimes, it just means you have to make new ones...   Feeling:  Happy and kind of surprised at all these old writings.  Drinking:  Water. Ha!   Eating:  Nada.  Wishing:  A certain movie song comes to mind...   And even though I know how very far apart we are, It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star. And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby, It helps to think we might be sleeping underneath the same big sky!    Writing:  Re-writing that stupid Beethoven story.  Note to self: Multiple forms of the verb "to be" are your ENEMY! Gah!   Singing:  Old songs from my music directory. LoL!!
