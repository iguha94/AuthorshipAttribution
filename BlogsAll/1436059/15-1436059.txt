I haven't posted since Monday? Well then...  My psycho neighbor keeps coming over and ringing the doorbell, stealing the mail, and calling on the phone. Brad thinks its hilarious and keeps egging her on. Meg thinks it is extremely freaky and wants Brad to ignore her...which he won't.  We (Me, Brad, & Meg) have been painting my dad's shed for FIVE DAYS! Damnit. It is the job that will never end, and its the job from hell. Thank you. Meg keeps bossing me and Brad around, so we have quit and then rejoined her painting squad on numerous occasions. Mostly because Meg would remind us after we quit that there was good money involved. We still haven't finished.  On Wednesday night some cousins from my moms side (Brad & Meg are from my dad's side) stayed the night. They drove from Michigan to here since their flight leaves at Baltimore-Washington International Airport. It was my Uncle Joe, his daughters Katie & Sarah, Joe's 2nd wife Sue, and Sue & Joe's sons, RJ and Desmond (Desi). They had to go get their passports on Thursday, but then me, Brad, Meg, Katie, and Sarah stayed home alone in the afternoon. It was very funny because my psycho neighbor kept coming to ring the doorbell. We locked all the doors and her dumbass dog still went through the backyard (since the psycho neighbor stole our padlock) and pooped all over the place. But that night my dad talked to the psycho neighbor's adoptive mother. She's in trouble now...  That's about it. Oh yeah. Me, Brad, Meg, & my dad went to see Lara Croft 2 today. It sucked. Don't go see it, its not worth the time. Honest. Pirates of the Carribean was better...Savvy?
