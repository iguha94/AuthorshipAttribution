Okay, so I didn’t get any snow. Like, a dusting, where you couldn’t even see the snow except for the cracks in the sidewalk. So, I woke up this morning at 5:30 and took my shower, got ready, and left the house to get Mandy by 6:30. It was, oh, say about ten degrees Fahrenheit, and we were waiting for the bus. Then it gets to be almost seven and we start wondering where the bus is. That’s when my ears started losing the feeling.  Then, it’s almost 7:05 and we haven’t seen any buses at all. Classes start at 7:17 so we start thinking we won’t make it at all in time. Nikki’s mom called the school then and told them, but they said they hadn’t had a report of a broken-down bus. Then it got to be 7:15 and people start leaving the bus stop, since they’re all freezing. At that point I couldn’t feel my ears at all and my feet were starting to tingle.   Nikki’s mom calls the school two more times and they finally report that our bus driver simply ‘skipped’ a few stops! It was almost 7:30 and we all went home! So I have an excused absence from school (it shouldn’t really be an absence at all since it’s not my fault!) and I have the whole day to myself. It was so freaky. We were making jokes about it! Well, I was making jokes about it. “This is like the Twilight Zone!” or, “This is like Titanic while they’re waiting for the boats! Jack! Don’t leave me Jack!”  So now I’m home, and I can catch up on my Creative Writing project and all my posts on the BD. Cool! Free day! Guess I didn’t need a snow day!
