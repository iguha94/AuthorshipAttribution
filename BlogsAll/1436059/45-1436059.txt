Quiz time!    Atychiphobia:  Fear of Failure.       What Phobia Are You?     brought to you by   Quizilla     Haha! One of the questions was, "Which place would you least like to live?" and the answer I picked was, "Uhh, Death Valley would sort of suck really bad..."        which smilie are you?    *snickers* GRRRR....                 I don't need one, but hey, who doesn't want a boyfriend? Well, okay, yeah, girls who already have one...feminists maybe...girls who just got dumped by one...errr...okay, bad idea...           I am Nose Picking Avril!   Avril seems to have this disgusting fetish with picking her nose.  Maybe she's trying to flick her brain out of her ear.  Maybe someday it'll work!  Or can we only hope?   Which stupid Avril are  you ?         My friend sent me a link to this anti-avril site and I took one of the quizzes...at first I got butt-crack avril...but now I am a nose-picking avril...I think I'd rather be a butt-crack Avril...

Not that spikes would help much on that killer hill. Besides, it'd be fun to slide down that one hill. Tonight is the first night of Sunday School. I want to go actually, and I hope its more interesting and interactive than first through eigth grade of Sunday School was. Yay. For some strange reason, my church does confirmation in tenth grade instead of eigth, so I can't wait for that either.
