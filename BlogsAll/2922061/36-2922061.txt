         Gore rants to Moveon.Org. Dang. And to think I actually voted for Al Gore. It was him or Nader, and my then-GF talked me out of Nader. But that seems a long time ago in a galaxy far away.     The Boston Herald   has the right response:   He never mentioned Nicholas Berg. Or Daniel Pearl. Or a single person killed in the World Trade Center. Nor did former Vice President Al Gore talk of any soldier by name who has given his life in Iraq. And he has the audacity to condemn the Bush administration for having "twisted values?"         Gore spent the bulk of a speech before the liberal group MoveOn.org Wednesday bemoaning Abu Ghraib and denouncing President Bush's departure from the "long successful strategy of containment."         Yes, the very same strategy that, under Gore's leadership, allowed al-Qaeda operatives to plan the horror of Sept. 11 for years, while moving freely within our borders.         Gore even had the audacity to defend the perpetrators of the prison abuse -- by name -- while denouncing President Bush for "humiliating" our nation.         How dare he. How dare a former vice president of the United States go beyond disagreeing with the current president's policies -- a right of anyone in this free country -- and denounce Bush as "incompetent."         How dare Gore say that Americans have an "innate vulnerability to temptation... to use power to abuse others." And that our own "internal system of checks and balances cannot be relied upon" to curb such abuse.         And this man -- who apparently has so much disdain for the nature of the American people -- wanted to be elected to lead it?         It is Gore who has brought dishonor to his party and to his party's nominee. The real disgrace is that this repugnant human being once held the second highest office in this great land.   And the real scary thing is that he was about 550 votes away from holding the highest. He's still in that galaxy far away. He's on the side that doesn't believe we're at war. This is how that side thinks and how it lashes out after watching the rest of us wage a war they refuse to admit exists.
