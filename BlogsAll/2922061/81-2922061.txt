         "Islam Online" is a news service that gives the truth about the Mideast from, I suppose you'd call it a "non- American" perspective. Here's a sampling, headlined "Palestinian Fighters Kill Five Israeli Settlers."    GAZA CITY, May 2 (IslamOnline.net & News Agencies) - Five Israeli settlers were killed Sunday, May 2, and three soldiers injured in a Palestinian resistance attack on an Israeli settlement in occupied southern Gaza.  Two Palestinian fighters disguised as shepherds ambushed two cars of Israeli settlers near the Kissufim road, which leads to the major Gush Katif settlement bloc, witnesses told IslamOnline.net.  The Palestinian resistance groups Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committees claimed the attack.  Earlier, media outlets said the operation was claimed Hamas armed wing Ezzudin Al-Qassam Brigades, which later denied responsibility, but praised the â€œheroic operationâ€.    The dead were a 34-year-old woman, 8 months pregnant, and her four little girls, ages 2 to 11. I can well understand the threat a 2-year-old girl posed, that would require the brave "resistance" (one of whom is pictured at left) to spray her with machine gun fire.  It wasn't a misake, by the way. According to the "Jerusalem Post," Tali Hatuel, 34, who was 8 months pregnant, and her daughters, Hila, 11, Hadar, nine, Roni, seven, and Merav, two, were shot at point-blank range, after initial gunshots brought their car to a halt. The terrorists then sprayed the car with bullets to ensure that all the occupants were dead.  Hey, I have an idea: let's bend our power toward helping these people get a country.
