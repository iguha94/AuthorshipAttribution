Hello.  I am not a hypocritiieeeeeeeeeeeee.  See? I blogging.  Ha.  I gets to rant about shit here, TOO.  NOT JUST YOU.  I'M SPECIAL, TOO.  I be just likie you and rantie about MY school.  Period 0 - Bio first thing in the morning.  What's worse, I sit in the front row.  The teacher thinks he's funny and constantly breaks out in songs.  OH MY GOD.  Yay!  Classification of insects!  And we had a conversion test.  HALF THE GODDAMN TEST WAS NEW MATERIAL THAT HE DIDN'T EVEN TEACH US,  THE IDIOT.    Period 1 - The teach ain't even her half the goddamn time.  'Pparently, he ain't be here no more to teachie no more.  But 'tis okay, his class easy as hellful.  Period 2 - Ceramics.  Oh my god.  The teachieful is funny as hell though.  The upperclassmen sitting next to me were have a convo about a "big-ass party" and then the teacher comes over and was like, " how stupid.  Think about it.  A Big-Ass party?  I'm sorry, you don't qualify, you can't come in."  Funniful.  Period 3 - The only female teach I gots-Nicholson.  Oi.  Don't likie her classie.  Period 4 - My god, the disgrace.  DRAMA.  I don't even wanna talk about it.  Period 5 - World History.  My god.  But the teach is the coach for mock trial, so we does lots of debates.  Period 6 - Golfie and Basketball.....so very very tiring.    If you haven't noticed, I ain't in a bloggie mood right now.
