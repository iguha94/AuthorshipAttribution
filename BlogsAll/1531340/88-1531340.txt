TWO DAYS IN A ROW OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111!1!!!ONEONEELEVENTWELVE   zero period  More bullshit.  We're learning how to find the volume of pyramids now.  Oh my fucking god, a pyramid!  Fan me, I'm keeling under the difficulty of this shit.   second period  An hour and a half of  Gandhi , which wouldn't be such a bad movie if we didn't have to watch it all at once.  And if the chairs weren't so uncomfortable.  Ugh.  Had to keep shifting so I wouldn't obstruct everyone's view.  Remind me why I'm right next to the projector screen again.   fourth period  TWO HOURS OF PE.  OH SHIT.  Softball.  Not bad, but could be better.  Nearly got hit by the bat.  Stupid, stupid, stupid Kevin.  My team is amusing, and I think there was horse crap near the fence.  [blinks]  Okay...   sixth period  STAR testing, man!  I'm still reeling over the example change, and now this.  There's only one question I  know  I got right: the one with the Latin root of provide.  At least I think it's right.  It couldn't possibly have rooted from aedificere [to build]... or the other ones.  I went with "to see."  Videre.  Moo.  The test took about ten-fifteen minutes for me.  After it, I reread  Deception Point  (439 pages), wrote out the lyrics to  American Pie , and stared at the ceiling.  How utterly amusing.  And now I'm home, and Mother-dear just let me buy Zazel's  DxD  single and a 1.5 GB mp3 player.  So there IS a God...         Just kidding.
