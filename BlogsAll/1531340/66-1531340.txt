Y'all think YOU had a nice, lovely day on your second semester start.  Lemme tell you, you are soon to be beaten!  Let's see.  I think I'll do a play-by-play kinda thing....^_^.  Wow that looks like he has a PIMPLE on his cheek.  ^_^   6:25 A.M.:  Daddy's talking to me in the car about ball-point pens.  I was writing on a piece of paper with one on the car window.  He asked if it was working.  I said yeah.  He was like, "You wanna hear something about your lovely NASA corporation?"  Stupid me, I bit.  "Ball point pen only work with gravtiy.  Your NASA went and spent 2 million dollars devising a pen that could write in outer space, in anti-gravity.  Whoop-de-freaking-doo, it worked.  Now you see, there are these Russian people.  They're quite smart.  So smart, in fact, that they saved 3 years and 2 million dollars.  They mandated that everyone used PENCILS up in outer space."  >.   6:30 A.M.:  I arrive in the Snakteria (just hearing the name makes me wanna hurl) to pick up my schedule.  They don't open the window until about 6:40.  During this time, I sit and tell Chicken my dad's lovely pen joke.  Then the windows open and we separate to get our schedules.   6:45 A.M.:  The Platypus realizes that she has only been given ONE class: 4th period -- Introduction to Drama.  OK.  So then the Platypus, poor, ickle, confused freshman that she is, wanders up to her zero period in utter shock.  Mr. Adams tells the poor platypus that she's gotta go get it fixed up in Guidance.  He kicks her outta the room, saying the class doesn't appear on her pink slip.  HELLO!  YOU DON'T THINK I  KNOW  THAT?  I'M MISSING 6 CLASSES, NUMBSKULL!  Anyhow.  The Platypus leaves the room.   6:53 A.M.:  I arrive in Guidance.  Tiny problem.  Um....the counselors don't GET there until 7:30.  Now, any of you out there who are worth your salt will have figured out I was about 35 minutes too early. So.  I walk around and visit all my little friends for the next 40 GODDAMNED MINUTES.  Mind you, all this before 7 A.M.   7:35 A.M.:  Arrive in office once again.  The really nice secretary lady looks at my schedule and she's like, "WOW!  I wish someone told ME I only had to be here for an hour!"  Then she pulled up my schedule and printed it out.  Then the whole office goes crazy.  Apparently, someone was printing out ALL the class rosters for second semester, which I thoguht was a real pity; they're all f***ed up anyhow.  So she doesn't know that and puts in that special pink paper.  Then whoop-de-doo out comes the class roster.  She gets all mad (again, this is a really really really nice, elderly lady) and scrunches it up and throws it away, only to later be told by any secretary that they'll be short that one roster.  ^_^  Then they come to the conclusion that they've been robbed; there's no more paper in ANY of the machines!  All in all, it was quite a kick in the pants.   7:40 A.M.:  Sprint to zero hoping to catch Adams before he leaves for the staff meeting; energy was wasted in that attempt; the turtle was still drinking coffee *zing in the head*.  I pick up my stuff and head downstairs, chilling for the next hour.  It's late start Monday!  Anyhow.  I eat those lovely sausage bite things.  I've called them something wrong both times now.  First I called them mini-corn dogs, and today, I called them TATER-TOTS.  What do you WANT from me?  I'm JUST TRYING TO GET BREAKFAST, OK?   9:00 A.M.:  Headed up to first period with Dahlberg.  The whole class badgered him for grades.  I got a 96% on the final exam and a 97% as a semester grade.  If only I had done that well in ANY of my other classes.  We were buggin him SO MUCH, all we did was go over the MUG shot on the board.  No, it wasn't a picture.  It's kinda like D.O.L.  I told you, Elfie, I ain't good with acronyms.  *GA-PAW!*   9:52 A.M.:  Ceramics; video bulletin.  WOOT!  TABOR GOT MARRIED!  HELL YEAH.  Chic was kinda fat, though.  XD  Yeah.  They disgraced the athletics.  Every damn team is winless in EVERY sport, with the exception of water polo.  POLO?!?!?!?!? OK.  Of course, this is only varsity; JV's are doing pretty well....I think.  I HAVE AN A IN THIS CLASS, BABY!  DON'T WORRY, IT ONLY GOES DOWNHILL FROM HERE.   10:54 A.M.:  Algebra 2.  Hell.  Don't even GET ME STARTED.  I AM BACK WITH A VENGEANCE THIS SEMESTER.  MUST AVENGE MY GRADE.  *shudders* So close, I tell you.  So CLOSE!  HATE HATE HATE.  We were GOING to have new POW groups, and consequently, new seats, but this one soph dropped the class.  LOL.  THe groups were all messed up.  hehehe.  nicholson had a fit.  XD   11:46 A.M.:  Drama.  Yay.  95.1% in the class, baby!  HELL YEAH!  Well.  We did improv the whole time.  Was quite fun, actually.  I didn't have to go up *hint hint*.   12:32 P.M.:  Lunch!!!  Me and the monkey decided to go and get salad from Christina's mom.  Hehehe.  She gave me a LOT!  Whoa.  I swear, I didn't finish it.  XD   1:17 P.M.:  World Hist.  Ok.  I HAVE AN A!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WOOT!  HELL YEAH.  ANyhow.  We watched this really really broing documentary.  Well.  see, first semester, we passed eveyrthing to the  left.  NOW, WE'RE PASSING IT ALL TO THE RIGHT!   NO!!!!!!!!!!!  I'M IN THE RIGHT COLUMN!!!!!!!  I HAVE TO  COLLECT  STUFF!  Anyhow.   2:09 P.M.:  Reported to Tabor for Basketball.  We were outta there in two seconds.  Tiff, on the other hand, had to go and get her thing signed by the track people.  Then they had a "meeting."  Grrrrrrrr.  I would've been home an hour earlier....but it's alright.  I'm cool like that.    OK.  My basic over-view of grades....   Biology H -- B+ [4 points for my ga-paw] English 1H -- A [5 points for my ga-paw] Ceramics -- A [4 points for my ga-paw] Algebra 2H -- B+ [4 points for my ga-paw] Drama -- A [4 points for my ga-paw] World History H -- A [5 points for my ga-paw] Basketball -- A [4 points for my ga-paw] Golf -- A [4 points for my ga-paw]  SEMESTER GPA:   With Golf -- 4.25 Without Golf -- 4.29  I say with or without golf....I dunno if it's going to count.
