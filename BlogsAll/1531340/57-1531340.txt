IIIIII AAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!  WOOT!  I LOVE L.A.!  Ok.  My trip in a goddamn nutshell.   Thursday, December 25, 2003 :  Left house around 11:30 A.M.  Went and ate noodles.  Got to the goddamn airport around 1:00 P.M.  So then I decided, "OK, I'm going to take a piss, and then we're going to board."  Ha.  That's what I thought.  Then I ask my dad what time our plane leaves, and he's like, "4:30," at which point my jaw died on me.  Just about maxed out my cell phone talking to Chicken and Monkey.  Blah.  Whatever.  Arrived in Seattle around 6:45 P.M.  Went to my dad's friend's house.  Slept.  Ta-da!  Friday, December 26, 2003 :  Let's see.  Basically, in the morning, we ran around downtown Seattle.  oOoo I sawed the KeyArena...it's where the Sonics play, and pitiful as they are, they're still an NBA team.  We went to eat in the Space Needle.  Ya know, the big, tall, pointy thing.  Oh my fucking god have you any idea how expensive that food is?  Haha.  A damn bowl of soup is 13 goddamn bucks.  Blah blah blah.  Basically, the two main courses that we ordered died.  They never came.  So we ditched.  Then we went on some cruise.  OoooOoO their hot chocolate was good!  We went through some lock system.  It's used to raise and lower ships trying to get from freshwater to saltwater, and vice versa.  The water levels are different, see.  Yeah.  Then we went and ate Sushi Land.  Holy shit, that shit is GOOOOOOD!  It's sushi!  My god, my brother ate about 70 pieces of smelt roe sushi.  Anyhow.  On to the next day.  Saturday, December 27, 2003 :  Woot!  We went and visited a damn salmon hatchery!  Yay!  BORING!  Then we went to some Snoqualmie Falls thing.  It's a waterfall.  *nodnod*  We decisded to head down to the base of the lovely waterfall, and at the bottom there were these two people who had just caught two huge ass steelhead trout fish.  Then I got mad at my dad and then I just stomped up to the top. My god it was about 20 degrees outside.  My God.  Then we went to some state park thing, and IT STARTED TO SNOW.  HOLY SHIT I HAD NEVER SEEN SNOW BEFORE.  I WAS IN GODDAMN HEAVEN!  BOO-YAH!  Please keep in mind that this is nothing but a mere run-down of what I did.  If I elaborate any further, my computer will explode from being on too long.  We then departed for the University of Washington.  Saw the locks from up on land.  Yay.   Sunday, December 28, 2003 :  BORING.  So we drive to Vancouver.  CANADA!  HELL YEAH!  Anyhow.  We end up eating at a Chinese restaurant in Vancouver.  Haha.  So halfway through our meal, the table behind us vacates, so a new group of people comes in.  All of a sudden, one person bumps into a waiter, and then plates are everywhere and there's soy sauce pouring down my mom's back.  Haha.  AND SHE WAS WEARING YELLOW!  Whatever.  Yeah.  So that was the highlight of the day.  It took forever to get across the border.  It was actually pretty nice weather.  Woot!  We ate Sushi Land again!  Monday, December 29, 2003 :  Wow.  This day was boring, too.  We walked along a bridge for about an hour, and then we decided to go to an ice cave.  Too bad it was closed.  Haha.  So we ended up going to Kirkland, WA.  *You notice that's the name of the brand of Costco goods*   Tuesday, December 30, 2003 :  oOooo This day was fun!  We went to the Museum of Flight.  Naturally, I was crazy excited, and so was my dad.  OMG.  Then my brother and I did something that we had never done before.  We actually paid to get onto a sumulator!  See, first of all, my parents NEVER let us go on those rides that cost extra money, even after an admissions ticket.  Second of all, I've never been on a GODDAMN SIMULATOR!!!!!  HELL YOU HAVE NO GODFUCKING IDEA HOW EXCITED I WAS!!!  OH MY GOD.  So basically, my brother and I were in that thing for four minutes just spinning the shit outta ourselves.  MY GOD IT WAS FUN!  oOoo and then we saw all about the Apollo missions and such.  MY GOD I WAS IN GODDAMN HEAVEN.  OMG THEN WE WENT ON AIR FORCE ONE.  Not the one Bush rides around on..GOOD GOD I WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDERING GOING ON  THAT  ONE.  It was the one that took Nixon home after he resigned....but whatever.  Hell, my dad took a picture of me imitating Nixon's farewell wave.  HELL YEAH.  We stood outside for about 3 hours in the damn 20 degree weather.  Helllllll it was FREEZING!  FROSTBITE...psh.  OK.  In the afternoon, we go to the Museum of Glass, but we didn't go inside for the tour.  Dammit.  I wanted to.  Whatever.  OK.  So we go back to their house.  SHIT IT STARTS SNOWING LIKE CRAZY.  Our plane flight home was scheduled for 7:30 A.M. today.  So, before the big snowstorm, we had settled on leaving around 5 and getting there around 5:30 in the morning.  But since it was snowing, there was no way to be sure that it would be safe to drive that early in the morning, since the snow would become ice and sleet overnight.  So we leave for the airport right then.  We get to the airport around 11:30 P.M.  So we sleep at the airport.  There were a lot of people sleeping at the airport.  Yup.  By the time we actually found seats, it was this morning.  Wednesday, December 31, 2003 :  So it's about 12:00 at midnight this morning and we just sleep on the seats at the airport.  This fat person sat next to me.  It was hard to sleeeeeeeeeeep.  Aiyah.  My parents didn't get any sleep.  Yeah.  We took a 32-seater from Seattle to Portland, and then we switched to a Boeing 737-400 plane from Portland to Ontario.  Then I came home.  Shit.  That took a long time.  It's almost New Year's.  HAPPY NEW YEAR'S!!!!
