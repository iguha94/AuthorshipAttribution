Holy shit.  I cannot fucking move.  Dammit.  Holy shit.  Practice was hell yesterday.  Haha, I've used a cuss word in every previous sentence so far.  Not anymore.  Anyhoo, here's the damn skinny on the stupid practice that almost has us dead on our feet.  First of all, I slept over at Jody's house for her birthday on Staurday night.  So yesterday, we went to her mommy's alumni barbecue thing.  We filled up water balloons, and we began to throw them.  Shit, it was three on one.  Jody, Joanne, and Jaimie all tried to get me.  Shiite.  I took about 7 full-front hits.  I got Joanne back, though.  She was trying so hard not to get wet.  Haha.  After she got me, she ran behind the railing, and I chucked the damn balloon.  It exploded against the railing and soaked her back completely.  Holy shit.  Haha, she was like, "Oh hell, no.  You did not just do that."  Haha.  I got hit about fifty times.  I got Jody on the arm and Jaimie 'round the midriff.  Damn, by the time I got to practice, me and Jody were both soaked as hell.  Haha.  Then Stacey   was like, "There's too much ash in the air.  You guys don't have to run today.  Besides, it's the first practice back."  Everyone was scared as hell....she ALWAYS makes us run.  Anyhoo.  We did layups for about 50,000 hours.  Then we did shooting.  Then we played knockout.  Loser had to do "Executions."  Stacey would tell you waht to do.  Dammit.  I was runner-up all four damn times.  So we're playind everyone else is doing sit-ups.  So I lose, and then Stacey tells me, "Push-ups."  Shit.  I was like, "Why the hell is everyone else doing sit-ups?"  Haha.  Like it mattered.  We had to do "Stacey push-ups."  She'd say "down" and then we'd have to go down and STAY there until she said up.  Damn.  You should've seen it.  Everyone's arms were shaking.  Then we did sit-ups, same thing, except she said "up" instead.  Yeah.  It was weird.  When we were doing sit-ups, everyone was complaining that their abs hurt.  I dunno why, but everytime I did one, my stomach wouldn't hurt, but there would be a shooting pain in my forehead.  Then we did leg lifts.  So today we were all dead.   So anyhow, today:  Period 0 - Biology H: We gots out quizzes back.  90%!  Hell yeah!  I though I failed.  Period 1 - English 1 H: I forgot what we did.  Crap.  Oh yeah.  We graded shit.  Period 2 - Ceramics: Crap.  I'm going to fail this damn class.  Period 3 - Algebra 2 H:  Holy cow.  I'm actually getting better at that math.  Holy shit.  I'm actually getting them right.  AND I'm doing them faster than everyone else.  *gloat*  Period 4 - Drama:  Yay.  Laura and I spent the damn period talking about how we couldn't move.  Shit.  Period 5 - World History H: Yeah.  We took notes.  LOTS of them.  Crap.  Me hand died.  AND my arm was already dead.  Period 6 - Golf: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  The match was cancelllllllled.

Neither can Laura, nor can Jody.  Haha.  That's 60% of our team.  Shit.
