As was previously explained in   this post , today is our "one year anniversary" of posting in this blog!  Do refer to   this page  for the gory details.  So it's been a nice long year, no?  I was awfully angsty back then.  Overly so, I think.  >>;  Note:  This is in whatever order I felt like putting it in, which means it's probably not chronological.   Nostalgia Moment.  Yeah.  So... I miss Mesa.  I remember how we all hated Mears with a bloody passion because she was so hypocritical and racist.  Heh, seventh period thought she was so smart-- yeah right.  She'd be dumb as dirt if fifth period hadn't corrected all of her mistakes.  Which reminds me.  I still put "Period 5" on my English papers at Troy.  Fsck yeah.  Honors English pride, man.  {air five}   And Another.  Publications rocked my shoes.  It was the only thing-- the only one!-- that showed I had brains.  I still remember how to develop black and white film.  I feel so utterly proud.  The darkroom was great, but not when you're locked in there with like... six guys.  Who all really, really want to scare you shitless and make you scream.  And laugh.  Damn you, Joe.  Vincent.  Jonathan.  People.  I still remember random conversations, scary as that is.  GEOFFREY:  AAAAHAHAHAHA!  I'm going to-- ME:  Dude, stop bugging me. JOE:  Yeah, stop hugging her. ME: ... Erm, I said bugging. JOE:  Oh.  GUS:  So, Geoffrey, you get the job of making sure the darkroom is in suitable condition for photograph developing.  That means you have to be sure all the temperatures are right, and you have to-- JONATHAN:  Be the custodian! JESSICA:  Janitor! GEOFFREY: That's "darkroom editor" to you. ME:  How the hell do you edit a darkroom?  And of course, it was bloody hilarious when Gus insulted people.  Just because.  Gus rocked.  Nelson keeps saying he's gay.  How can he be gay?  If he got any straighter, he'd be a Larry.  Which reminds me, the:  Larry Nostalgia Moment.  Aaaaaa, Algebra I with Gus was AWESOME.  Doesn't anyone think it was awesome too?  Man, everyone was so smart it was CRAZY.  And Gus is an awesome teacher.  Yes, he is.  Really.  Everyone failed to realize that because he was so much stricter than the other teachers, but that man is smart as hell.  Anyway, so the LARRY.  Once upon a time, Larry needed a ruler.  But, alas, Larry didn't have a ruler.  So, this poor child asked Mr. Gustafson !for a ruler.  Mr. Gustafson, being the kind, caring soul he is, laughed at him.  GUS:  Gosh, Larry!  Just take this paper.  See?  Fold it in half.  See this edge?  It's straight. STRAIGHT-EDGE.  So, if you ever need a STRAIGHTEDGE, fold a piece of paper, crease it, and call it a Larry!  I have my Larry right here.  =D   Random Sixth Grade Non Sequitur Reminiscence.  I thought sixth grade was odd.  We had block schedules and I got lost.  A lot.  But Hansen's third/fourth period block was AWESOME.  AHAHAA, Platypus!  Remember how we almost NEVER got in trouble?  And Table D shall live on in infamy.  Boo-yah.  Eck, I remember I had to sit next to Sergio at the beginning of the year in Table C.  He smelled really, really bad.   Catalina Island  Ooooo, I  >;  Anyway, Jessica (Pumpkin) was my tent buddy person.  We had this huge tree shadow above our tent.  That was scary.  And I swear that half my cot was hanging out the tent.  Sheshca tripped over the metal lining of the tent, scraped her knee, and couldn't do anything water-related for the whole of the trip.  >>;  Except kayaking, which ROCKED.  BOO-YAH.  We had the most awesome group ever.  Our chaperone was Sharky (Jimmy's dad), our Catalina staffer dude was Tommy, and our group number was THREE.  Sharky was awesome and Tommy wore his cheerios shirt!  =D  Yeah, I still remember our group names.  Kinda.  I think we were... Sharky's Cheerios, Triple Threat, and.. other.. stuff.  I think I remember the people in the group, too, but I'm not sure.  Jessica Choochoo, Jei Jai, Sheshca, me, Dennis, Jimmy, and... other.. people.. I... forgot.  Holy crap the food was GOOD.  Haha... yes.  I remember that Jackie had to identify a humpback whale.  Or someone.  The squid dissection was awesome, 'specially cause we ate the squid (cooked, of course) afterwards.  Disgusting once you think about it a little, but hey, we were sixth graders.  We didn't think.  Much.  Like I wrote before, kayaking kicked ass.  Major, major ass.  I think Tommy said something about there being tiger sharks in the kelp, but I didn't see them.  Feh.  Someone got a snake on their kayak, though.  It was funny, and I think Collins identified it as a random ground snake afterwards.  How the hey it got yaaaaards away into the ocean is up for debate, folks.   Another Nostalgia Moment.  The DC trip was, without doubt, one of the best experiences I've ever had, ever.  EVER.  Barring when Platypus and I got lost in Baltimore, it was really great.  Remember when we checked in at the Baltimore hotel?  XD~  We watched all those kiddy shows and sang along with the theme songs-- that was awesome.  The million dollar socks, dude.  Remember?   ^^  The airport was great, too.  Screw Cedarlane vs. Mesa; somehow, I think Newton vs. Mesa was more fit for this one.  Ah... and who could forget getting lost at Mount Vernon?  XD!  Remember, Platypus?     "I can't find the big grass thing!  It's on the map, but it's NOT SHOWING UP IN FRONT OF ME AND--"   "Look.  In.  Front.  Of.  You."   "Oh, there it is."    Map illiterate for life, man.  MAP ILLITERATE PRIDE.  {another air five}  Shear Madness was greaat. THE MALE:  She was too busy picking up HALF OF WASHINGTON's MALE POPULATION. THE FEMALE DUDETTE:  Well, *you* screwed the other half!  Absolutelyfuckingpriceless.  Especially when the guy wore a MESA ROBLES shirt onstage.  Oh man, you shoulda heard the cheering.  =3  Aaaaaaa, the Jefferson Memorial!  That was HILARIOUS.  LOL, I think we were going to be late for the bus, so we were running out towards the entrance.  And then we turned around, and we saw the STATUE.  Holy crap, that was friggin'  scary .  HAHAHA, I screamed.  XD  Gettysburg was kinda creepy.  Eric swore up and down that he saw a ghost.  I'm gonna swear up and down righ' now that he was lying his ugly little Korean ass off.  Hi.  Semi-racist.  Bye.  Oh yeah, one more.  Two words, dude:   BIG TREE.    Random OMGSQUEE Moment of the Week.  Guys who listen to Disney music and aren't afraid of saying so are so cute.      Monday, May 24th:   I.  Hate.  Mondays.  Always and for'ver.  I don't believe we did anything productive, but it was four days ago.  Hey, I can't even remember what I did this morning, okay?   {{ Geometry H &raquo; p0 }}    I think I just zonked out or something.  It can't have been anything special, because I don't remember it.  That and this is  Geometry , folks.  To have something special is to-- I don't know, I don't know.  {{ ICT &raquo; p1 }}    I wired Lab 20, but when we went to get it signed Allen asked us questions and An couldn't answer them!  (#@!$%)  Note to self:  Tutor An before getting the labs signed.  Another note:  Get a better lab partner.  {{ Nonwestern Cultures IB &raquo; p2 }}    Nothing, I don't think.  I don't remember what we did at all.  >  {{ Biology H/IB &raquo; p3 }}    Nuuu idea.  Maybe something about notes and IQ's.  {{ PE }}    Oh, this I know.  We played basketball.  Either that or we walked around the gym.  Pick one, any one.  {{ Latin }}    Uhhh.... ??  {{ English }}    Nooo idea, but I'm willing to bet it had something to do with  Romeo and Juliet .  Big surprise.  I think.  We went over.  Act Five.  But I'm not sure.  Decisions, decisions.    Tuesday, May 25th:   Hmmmm.  It's all coming back to me--- oh wait, that was today.   {{ Geometry H &raquo; p0 }}   Still no idea.  Though I did sleep through this class for the entire week, so... I think it had something to do with transformations.  The lesson, I mean.  Arhar.  {{ ICT &raquo; p1 }}   Allen TALKED.  And talked.  And talked.  About multiplying binary numbers.    ALLEN: Okay.  Let's multiply 1 and 0!  What do you get? JOHN:  Two!  That kid's so clueless it's hilarious.  {{ Nonwestern Cultures IB &raquo; p2 }}    Oh god, sophomore ID card pictures.  I had nooo idea they were coming up!  >  {{ Biology &raquo; p5 }}    Uhhh... stuff.  Yeah.  {{ PE &raquo; p4 }}     Aaa, basketball or walking around the gym.  It's all you, folks.  Bring this baby home.  {{ Lunch }}    Stuff.  I don't remember!  {{ Latin &raquo; p5 }}   Uhhh.  Stuff.  Again.  Yes.  Probably Heavenbashing, but I'm not entirely sure.  Sowwy.  {{ English &raquo;  p6}}    Lewis assigned the group project and a book report, which is due next Friday.  Six components.  I'ma gonna die.    Wednesday, May 26th   I REMEMBER TODAY!  =D =D  Who could forget?  Troy Tech Fair, man.  All the ubersmart seniors present their internship things in the North and South gyms. I had to go to the fair during third period (Biology) and fourth period (PE).  It got boring  very soon  after a while.  =D   {{ Geometry &raquo; p0 }}    I honestly have no idea.  Really.  {{ ICT &raquo; p1 }}   EARGH.  We had Coach Garland for a sub, so he was really anal about the lab-labeling and stuff.  We spent forever on Lab 21 only to realize I had the XOR thing backwards.  That was... evil.  Just plain evil.   I  We got the components signed and I started on the 22nd lab.    {{ Nonwestern Cultures IB &raquo; p2 }}  Woohoo, Cultural Experience!  :D  We had to bring artifacts or food representing our culture.  Heh, and then we had a FEAST.  Hell yeah.  I didn't eat anything, though.  Quite a shame.   Side note:  Why does Josh Pixler have to be so damn tall?   {{ Bio &raquo; p3 }}  Troy Tech fair.  Went with Jazzy, Kathy, and Rachel.  It was fun.  Not really.  ILLUSTRATOR.  [points and twitches]  ILLUSTRATOR.  Haha, Mel rocks.  {{ PE &raquo; p4 }}  More Troy Tech fair.  Watched the guys do Tae Kwon Do stuff whilst Rachel kept going "Kung fu's better!"  {{ Lunch }}  Sheila got called somewhere over the intercom, so we just went over to her English class and watched her  On Parole  class video project thing.  "We" being Sheila, Nataya, and me.  I don't know where Cristina and Emily went.  ^^;  Perhaps they stayed in Anime Club.  Who knows?  {{ Latin &raquo; p5 }}  Mm... I don't know.  I think I had to work with Heaven.  I got mad, but Ryan exploded for me 'cause I was too tired and he hates her more than I do.  Yay!  I do know that the new Latin teacher for next year came in this period.  She's so.. damned.. happy.  >>;  {{ English &raquo; p6 }}  "Worked" on the group project with Bianca, Jessie, and Brian.  Jeremy was outside reading  Catcher in the Rye , so we talked to him too.  Yeah.  Jeremy's an oddball.  We were discussing how boring it would be if everyone were normal (Do  not  ask how this is relevant to Juliet's character.).  Then we practiced for about fifteen minutes.    Thursday, May 27th   Ooh, I think I can remember yesterday.  Yesterday was boring.  But it wasn't bad.  Wait, it was.  Never mind.   {{ Geometry &raquo; p0 }}  Rasch caught me sleeping.  ;.;  HIGH:  Richard can't make fun of me for being so tiny she can't see me.  LOW: She.. caught.. me.. sleeping.  Yeah.  So... not good.  {{ ICT &raquo; p1 }}  Lab time rocks my shoes.  I kept working on Lab 22 and finally finished it.  Got it signed, but was way too lazy to start on the last lab.  So I just... walked there.  Yeji brought her camera, and I avoided it.  Yaaaaaay me.  {{ Nonwestern Cultures IB &raquo; p2 }}  Um, group work.  Um.  Yes.  We didn't actually *do* anything, we just sat there.  I ate a piece of chocolate.  Dark chocolate.  With mint.    {{ Biology &raquo; p3 }}  Took notes and did an IQ for the entire period.  Kristy and Jazzy both stole my notes.  Evil fiends.  {{ PE &raquo; p4 }}  I was in a really freakishly bad mood for some odd reason.  I walked, nay, stomped around the gym humming  Berry .  It's creepy once you think about it for a while, especially if you know the lyrics in the beginning.  ( I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it.  I'll be good.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to blow your head open-- like RASPBERRY JAM. )  {{ Latin &raquo; p5 }}  Ehh... some grammar crap and reading.  {{ English &raquo; p6 }}  Group projects' presentations!  It was odd.  Yessss.    Friday, May 28th    {{ GEOMETRY }}  AAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH.  ;.;  I swear, I was just counting down the seconds until this crap of a class ended.  >   {{ ICT }}  HELL YEAH, CHARLOTTE WINS.  I wired Lab 23 and we're done.  DONE.  Now we're doing Lab 18 (Already did 8b, 8c, 16, and 17) for extra credit.  Charlotte wins.  Charlotte wins.  Allen still thinks An is slow in the head.   Wow, so fast?  Did you keep An away from the board with a stick?    {{ NONWESTERN CULTURES }}  We were supposed to be doing groupwork, but I just did my geometry homework instead.  It was fun, though, because I got to eavesdrop on all the other groups.  Quite amusing, really.   {{ BIOLOGY }}  Argh, Kirkpatrick came back so we spent the entire period listening to him lecture.  >>;   {{ RALLY }}  Ditched.  We went to Hall's room where Nataya played with Hamlet and Tom Riddle.  Emily and Alice studied for the Biology SAT II.   {{ PE }}  Basukettuballu!  Against people I don't know!  We lost.  Durdur.   {{ LATIN }}  We just did translations for the entire period.  We've been translating a lot lately; I think Kline's trying to finish the book.  >>;   {{ ENGLISH }}  Finished presentations!  =D    Ehhh... I edit tomorrow just in case.  ^-^
