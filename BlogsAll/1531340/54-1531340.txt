HOLY SHIT IT WAS RAINING LIKE A MOTHER TODAY.  ME AND ODIE WENT OUTSIDE, AND GUESS WHAT.  I GOT HIT ON THE GODDAM HEAD.  WITH HAIL.  YES, THOSE LITTLE STUPID BLOCKS OF ICE.  SHIT.  BUT IT'S OK.  WE CAPTURED TWO OF THEM.  WE STUCK THEM IN THE FREEZER.  Period 0 - Biology H:  Test.  My god.  It was so much better than last time's test.  I'm hoping for a C this time!  Not a D!  A C!  I actually have enough confidence to hope for a C!  Hell yeah!  Period 1 - English 1H: Whoo-hoo.  I bullshited my interview with a WWII survivor......it was a total spin-off of Chicken's.  Hell, it was fun writing it.  Period 2 - Ceramics:  What fun.  Jessica is on a roll!  Two projects in one day!  Hell yeah!  Period 3 - Algebra 2H:  Another test.  Holy shit.  My stupid feasible region turned out ALL WRONG.  I just hope that the rest of the test works better.  Period 4 - Drama:  Whatever.  Scene goes up tomorrow.  Hell.  Period 5 - World History H:  All right.....an imperilism   &lt;Shameless Elfie Edit:  It's "imperialism," dear.  ^.^"&gt;  activity.....whatever.  This class is....well, the only oen I'm passing.  Period 6 - Basketball:  I got my program chagned today....I'm actually in basketball now.  Wow.  OMG.  Nobody changed today.  We were all hoping we didn't have the gym so we wouldn't have to play because it was so cold, but we just HAD to get the grm.  Whatever.  So about 20 girls changed in the girls' restroom.  Then we open the door and it is facking POURING outside.  After practice, we open the door.  It is nothing but mother facking SPRINKLING.  Crikey.  Then we get to Odie's house.  Holy shit it was funny.  Me and Odie saw lightning about 50000 times, and Chicken could never see it.  The TV signal was cut off about 4 times, and I was talking to my daddy, and then the phone line DIED.  Shit.....wacko.  Then we realized it was HAILING.  Hell yeah.  So me and Odie go outside.  I got hit on the head.  We saw lightning, too.  It was quite scary.  You try being outside and seeing lightning flash something like 10 feet in front of you.  As revenge, me and Odie captured two pieces of hail and imprisoned them in the damn freezer.  HAHAHHAHAAHA.  I WIN, YOU LOSE.
