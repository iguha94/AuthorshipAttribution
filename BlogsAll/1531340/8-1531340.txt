Enter me in fangirldom.  *smirk*   Geometry :  My life freaking SUCKS.  I have a B- in GEOMETRY.   GEOMETRY!   Yes, this is me talking.  A freaking  B- .  Bloody.  I also sit in the waaaay back of the class and so the teacher never looks at me, right? WRONG!  And whenever she sees me, she sees me doing something I'm not supposed to!  Like, reading manga instead of taking notes!  Or doing HOMEWORK in class!  Oh.. what a BIG crime.   English:   I have a BBBBBBBBBBBBB!!!!  AAAHHHH!! My life is over, seriously.  And Caitlin, stop it.  OR ELSE.. I WILL.. dunno.   NWC:   I totally failed the Africa test.  Where the bleep is Somalia?  I couldn't freaking find Somalia on the map!  (okay, so I couldn't find Malawi, Guinea, and Kenya either, but that's besides the point.)    Programming:   *beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep*   PE:   We played "tennis."  Bull.  We actually spent about 35 minutes stretching, 5 minutes whacking the ball at each other, and the rest of the time in the locker room.   Latin:   (aka the only class I'm passing x.x)  It was boring...  Dude.  I don't give SHIT about Pompeii.  And you know what?  The fact that iuvenes means "young men" means NOTHING to me.  I don't CARE about Latin!   Biology:   I'm getting a B+!!!  It's my second highest grade!  In  BIO!  I don't even LIKE bio!  Meeehhhh
