This is bullhickey.  I reckon I should start on my homework sometime soon.  I'm hoping to sleep before 10 tonight.  Ha, I doubt it.  Period 0: Biology H - This is stupid.  I have to transfer like 50 labs into my damn notebook.  Piece of sh*t.  Period 1: English 1 H - Haha, I'm always the last one in the class because almost nobody in my class has got a zero, so they're there real early.  I only gots 6 minutes to get to classie wassie.  I swear, Cook must think she runs the class now or something.  SO MUCH STUFFS TO DO!  Period 2 - Ceramics: What fun.  A box.  With a face.  A sun face.  Joy.  Period 3 - Algebra 2 H - Don't worry Elfie, I've got a B-, too.  But it's Honors, so it counts as an A.    Period 4 - I didn't have to go today!  Yay!  That means I get to pantomime brushing my teeth AND being a cow tomorrow.  *big grin*  Period 5 - World History H - We have to make stupid storybooks for little third graders.  The teach's wife teaches little third graders in Claremont.  Apparently, about 25% of the kids are the kids of Claremont college professors.  I was like, "WOW!  ASK THEM TO RECOMMEND ME!"  Haha.  Oh yes, by the way, we're supposed to explain.........the FRENCH REVOLUTION.  HELL, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW FRANCE EXISTED UNTIL LAST YEAR....  Period 6 - Golf/Basketball - I don't even know why I'm putting basketball, I'm not doing it yet.  Haha, stupid Baucher had Tiff's name on the list for playing today in the match.  Then he comes up to me and tells me that I'M playing.  I'm like, "What the hell?"  Haha, I did horribly.  Don't ask for my score.  I can't tell you.  If I did, I'd have to kill you.
