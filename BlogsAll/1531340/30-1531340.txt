My playlist is now officially 176 songs long.  30 are  X  songs, at least 70 are  Weiss Kreuz , 10 are  Yu-Gi-Oh! , and the others are all random anime songs.  I love Winamp.   mood:   a-ha.    listening to:  eX dream {X} and Sadame {X}   Period 0 - Geometry Honors:   We had a good ol' substitute today.  DAMN, he was boring.  -_-  We just did PROOFS the ENTIRE period.  Do you know how ANNOYING proofs are?  *tears out hair*  DIE!  DIE, PROOFS, DIE!   Period 1 - English 1 Honors:   *snooooze*  No  Of Mice and Men  movie today for ickle Elfie.  We did peer response stuff for our essays.  And since Little Miss Talkative wasn't here, I had to switch with some guy I don't know.  Yeesh, Gus would tear up his essay within a matter of milliseconds.  It KILLED my eyes.  English honors my tail end.   Period 2 - Nonwestern Cultures:   More oil concession stuff.  We made 14 billion dollars!  *wise nod*   Period 3 - Fundamentals of Programming:   Oh boy, this was fun.   More   for loops  and  if else  statements.  Curly brackets are truly annoying me now.   Period 4 - PE:   OH MY GOD.  We had THE MOST annoying substitute in the history of the world!  He was like.. 90 years old and was wearing shorts *cringes*  and acted like he was 25!  He made us do really retarded stretches, then told us to go play tennis.  Then, after the bell rang, he took roll.. AGAIN.. so we were all late for lunch.  Old men suck.   Lunch - Anime Club:   I listened to my muuusic... it was boring, though.  They couldn't get the DVD player to work.  Anyhow, I signed up for the committee on the wrong column.  I wanted to work with the secretary in the newspaper thing.  But now I'm stuck with reviewing anime.  Isn't that fun.  Yeah, normally I'd adore that.  But they'd probably make me review junk like  Rahxephon  and  Love Hina .  Ugh.   Period 5 - Latin:   Gotta love Latin, eh?  We had a quiz, then we did slave placards.. again.  Let me show you my Hannah one!       HANA  * Aegyptia {Yes, I made Hana Egyptian.}  * Hana est valida et sapiens.  * Hana est semper laeta.  * Numquam dormit, docet Latine, legit Latine          Anyone actually understand that?  xP   Period 6 - Biology:   ANOTHER substitute.  Oh well.  Finished my HW in class, so it wasn't bad.  ^_^
