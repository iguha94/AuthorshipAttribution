What fun.  Meee just got backed from schoolios.  Well, from Jody's house, where we went after school.  It was okay, considering I'd missed about 70,000 little tidbits of information from all my classes.  Shiznits.  Period 0 - Biology H:  Yay.  Sub today.  She happens to be a pretty good acquaintence of mine...we actually bought out house from her family, and she used to help with the basketball team about 3 years ago at Mesa.  It was fun.  We sat there and didn't do anything.  Watched some weird movie.  You know what?  I watched a movie in every core class today!  Well, not really, but close.  Period 1 - English 1 H:  Like I said.  Movie.  Title: The Human Comedy.  It was weird.  Yeah.  We're supposed to do a movie review thing...too bad I only watched the last damned part....psh.  Period 2 - Ceramics:  What fun.  Sat there the whole damned period fixing my box.  It ended up breaking.  *roar*  Period 3 - Algebra 2 H: Explained my whole little situation to Nicholson.  She agress with me.  Doctors are idiots.  Instaed of movies, we listened to Christmas songs.  Period 4 - Drama: Rehearsed our scenes.  My genius group thought I would be in the hospital forever, so they left me out.  Good.  We get docked 10%, and we still have to gimme a part.  Damn Gina....I mean, she's all like, "Go," and then    we go, and three seconds later she's like, "Wait, we should do [insert her lovely bullshit comments here]."  *roar*  Period 5 - World History H:  Well, um, we watched a movie.  It was really more of a power point, but who cares?  It was about....propaganda.  *woot*  Period 6 - Doctors said I wasn't supposed to play until Monday, but I'm going to play tomorrow....Screw the doctors.  If they couldn't find anything wrong, I'm going to facking play./  *nodnod*
