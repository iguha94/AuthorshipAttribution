*puts on ugly clothes and a dunce cap*  *clears throat*  *says in a deep, Austrian-accented voice*  I'm back.  DIE, Governator, DIE.   mood:   pissed  listening to:   Secret Sorrow {Koizumi Kouhei}  I'm blogging again.  I'm not a facking hypocrite; I blog more than you do, Platypus!    And now I shall talk randomly.  Okey.  Anyhow, I hate Mondays because it's the first day of the school week and there are five (!!) days until weekend starts again.  Plus the quarter is over and so I have tests and projects coming up.  Which means that I'm screwed.  X_X  I'm also sick.  I lost my voice today.  Eargh.  I couldn't sleep yesterday.  When I finally did, I had this really strange dream.  *nod*  It had all these anime people in it.  O.o;;;  From exceedingly random anime series.  Like, reaaally random.  From anime I don't even  watch .  -_-" There was Ranma from  Ranma 1/2 , Saitou from  Rurouni Kenshin , Hokuto from  Tokyo Babylon , Ryuichi from  Gravitation , Tohru from  Fruits Basket , Saiki from  X , Kokuyo from  Wish , Nagi from  Weiss Kreuz , Noa from  YuGiOh , and a bunch of other people I don't remember.  Eccchh.    ---> Geometry Honors    verbatim:   Me:  *snoooooze*   class:  We got our quizzles back.  I passed!  O.o;; And I bullshitted the entire proof too.  Eck.  I'm getting reaaally good at guessing.  That's proved in the next period.  ^^    ---> English 1 Honors    Verbatim:   Caitlin:  Hey, John! Everyone:  ... John? Caitlin:  John! Jim:  ME? Caitlin:  Oh, sorry. Jim:  WHY DOES EVERYONE CALL ME JOHN? Me:  Ya know, you remind me of Joe... Jim:  {glare}   class:  Bweeheehee.  I got full scores on ALL my etymologies quizzes except for one (I got one wrong ^^)!  (!!!)  I never study.  Like, ever.  I'm really getting good at this.  Heh.  We also did presentations today.  Plus Louden convinced Ms. Lewis to extend the soldier's letter due date to Monday.  Lovely.    --->Geography/Nonwestern Cultures IB    class:  Oh my GOD this class is so annoying!  All Farr does is laugh at herself!  Arrrggghhh...    --> Fundamentals of Programming    verbatim:   Me:  O-keh.  WHY was Shuichi wearing a schoolgirl outfit?! Dionne:  Because he thought it was bad to be gay, so he tried to become a girl. Me: ...    class:  Eargh.  More for loops and infiles and outfiles and just a bunch of bahookey I don't understand.  Death to C++.  DEATH.  ^^      ---> PE    verbatim:   Coach Homer:  Okay.  Now, the weather is really nice outside, with ash everywhere and all, so we're going to sit out there and consume as much ash as possible!  Everyone knows that ash is good for you and so you all need to go out there and get your daily ash intake! Everyone:  ... HAAAAH, Homer, that's funny. Me: . . .   class:  Boredom.  Utter boredom.  We sat around the gym.  I just read  X  while listening to  Velvet Underworld .  'Twas very, very redundant.    ---> Latin    verbatim:   Eric:  Why do you have a fake flower? Emily:  It's my birthday. Eric:  Is it real? Emily:  . . . !!  It's... fake...   class:  And yes, he actually said that.  'Twas a nice way to begin class, really.  -_-"  At least we didn't have to sing happy birthday in Latin.  We had to last week.  It was really, really weird.    ---> Biology    verbatim:   Mrs. Hall:  *babbleaboutATPandglycolysisforthirtyminutes* Mrs. Hall:  Got it? Everyone:  ... no.   class:  Argh!  I don't GET bio!  DIE!
