Oh ho, at least my school doesn't have idiots in it just because they admitted people of far below average IQ in.  My school is just a nice school that accepts idiots without testing them.  Not that you're an idiot, Elfie, I'm meaning other idiots. *coughERICAcoughGUNNcough*  And by the way, I don't have to be in plays...I CAN BE STAGE CREW!  Hell yeah.  Engineering was my second choice for a major...  Period 0 - Yay!  Triple-beam balances.  Graduated cylinder.  What fun.  Period 1 - Dammit, I'm starting to love this class.  Today, we had Mrs. Cook.  She's the sub's sub's sub.  In other words, she's the sub for the sub for the sub.  We haven't done ANYTHING ALL WEEK.  My god, it's been fun.   Period 2 - Ceramics...some idiot forgot to put a needle tool back.  WE HAD TO WRITE VOCAB WORDS AND TAKE A TEST.  I'd recite them to you, I still know the definitions, but my World History homework awaits, since Troy genius didn't gimme a straight answer.  Period 3 - Algebra 2...I'm going to fail that damn class.  POW's!    Period 4 - Drama....the teach is actually ok...blah  Period 5 - Yay!  We did that role play shit that we did in 7th with Lee....I WAS A PEASANT!  Period 6 - Golf/Basketball.  no golf today...matchie tomorrow.  Basketball don't start until I finish golf. God damn.  I'm the only one allowed on campus at Mesa before school is out!  Yay!  All you Troy people who want to go, FORGET IT.  Yay!
