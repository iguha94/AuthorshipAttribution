NO!  It's HERE!  We're all DEAD.  DIED.  Blowed-up.  Ka-blooey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Well now.  In case you haven't already figured it out, Saturday is tomorrow.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!!!!!!!  Everyone knows what that means.  So.  I shall run through the last day of my life.    Period 0 -- Biology H: Worms!  Awesome!  HAHAHAHAHA.  The guys in our class are ALL WIMPS.  lol.  Sorry guys, but you are.  Seriously.  The only one in our class wimpier than you guys was the Chicken.  Oii.  I would hope so.  She DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH IT!  LOL.  Anyhow.  It was awesome.  We couldn't open the jar.  Then he goes around distributing worms.  OMG.  I just realized.  HE DIDN'T WASH HIS HANDS!!!!!!  EWWWWWW.  So when he went to flip the pages in the book and he licked his fingers........EWWWWWWWW!  OMG!!!!!  EWWWWWWWW.  Period 1 -- English 1H: Watched "The Alphabet Murders" by Agatha Christie.  I didn't get it.   Phoo monkeys.  Period 2 -- Ceramics: Running outta time.  Uh oh.  Going to fail.  Crap.  Period 3 -- Algebra 2H: Test.  I think I did OK.  It wasn't too bad.  Period 4 -- Drama: Boles was showing the senior projects, so we went to Mackintosh's class.  Oiii.  The pooooooper.  Anyhow.  We "rehearsed" for 20 minutes, then we played Taboo.  Hahaha no one was paying attention.  It was awesome.  Lunch: Blah.  Bought lunch.  Then we walked around.  I SPUNNED AROUND WITH QQ!  Hahaha.  She's still dizzy.  Period 5 -- World History H: Watched the movie again.  Joseph Stalin.  Lovely.  Thick Russian accents.  Like I can figure out what they're trying to teach me even WITHOUT the LOUD MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND.  After School: Lala.  Stef's mom tooked her home, so Jody and I walked.  Jody walked to HER house and I walked back to MY house.  Oiii.  I could've sworn SHE pulled up by me and laughed at me before driving off.  That's just me, though.  Anyhow.  Then I went to Mesa, assuming my brother's game was at Mesa.  But NO.  It was one of their rare away games.  Damn.  Okay.  A few parting words.  I LOVE YOU ALL.  Hhaha.  For those of you who think I shall be leaving you something, check with QQ, my hired-fired-rehired-refired lawyer.  Hhaha.  It's been nice knowing you all............. ~The Idiosyncractic Platypus
