WAHAHA.  The Mavs got killed last night.  You know it.  But it's OK.  I still love them.  For crying out loud, they were playing against the Lakers.  So it's OK.  That still puts them in second place in the Western Conference, seeing as how Tim Duncan is going to get assassinated sometime soon.........*brainstormglaresmirk*  The Kings are hopeless.  I mean, yes, they beat the Lakers, but shit, it was a preseason game.  The fact still remains that the Lakers will make Western Conference Finals at the very least,  and I'm willing to bet almost anything on them winning the championship this year.  Biology H:  Yay.  We listened to the big idiot talk.  By big, I mean HUGE.  He's about 5000 pounds.  It's sad.  English 1 H: Yay.  More grammar.  Am I the only one who thinks it's fun?  Ceramics:  Crap.  We lost tool.  Again.  Those idiots.  MORE WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS!  Tell me, what the hell isa  written assignment for in a ceramics class?  Aiyah.  Algebra 2 H:  WE ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THAT DAMN POW.  No, not the prisoner of war.  Just the POW.  Drama:  Horrible.  For my play, I have to act like my husband just cheated on me.  WHAT THE HELL........  World History:  POP QUIZ.  The idiots just didn't know how to shut the hell up.  But I think I aced it.  Take that, dammit.
