All right, then, but we all know which school's better, ne?  At least I don't take DRAMA.  And I don't have to be in PLAYS, unlike a certain PERSON I know.. *COUGH*  FEH.  Oiiii.... someone asked me to homecoming... o____________________________O  *goes and hides in a corner*  MUMMIE...  So.. school today.  Period 0 - BLOODY.  We had to take a test today, and even though it's geometry and I've learned it before, I FAILED.  I know it!  I can't memorize theorems and postulates for shit.  And she put some really strange crap on the test.  Period 1 - It was okay.  I'm not voting for Caitlin because she keeps bopping me on the head with her dratted fluffy pen, but aside from that, it was pretty good.  And Jim/James or whatever his name is... FEH.  Must you call Weiss German Rice?  Period 2 - OMG.. I HATE this class.. but then you already knew that.  We just watched Denzel Washington get beaten to death.  'Twasn't interesting, I don't recommend it.  It didn't make me want to cry.  Now watching Kuroneko-sama get beat to death would make me cry.  Poor kitty.  Period 3 - *fuuuuuuuuume*  Period 4 - 'Twas gay.  It was picture day today, and we had to go take pictures during PE.  It was a frigging waste of time.  Period 5 - LATIN.  BAh.  It was SO very boring...  Period 6 - BIO.  OH MY GOD.. I FAILED THE TEST I SWEAR I FAILED IT...  *runs away sobbing*
