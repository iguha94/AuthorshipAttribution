I was going to blog yesterday.  In fact, I had it written out, but I deleted it just now because it sucked.  Anyhow, today was horrible.  If you don't know already,  I have some strange disorder.  I pick at my eyebrows.  For no reason.  So now they're horribly mismatched.  Screw that damned bio test.  I was so stressed over it I didn't realize I was disintegrating my right eyebrow.  Now I look like some ultra-demented freak.  Jesus Christ.  And no, I'm not Christian.  So sue me.  And some guy e-mailed me.  I was scared.    I watched  Tokyo Babylon  yesterday.  I decided to screencap baby Subaru, so I put the DVD in my computer.  Default setting was English with no subtitles.  Picture this. {whiny little voice} Subaru:  Saaaysheeroo?  UGH!  How could they do that to Subaru?  And Hokuto sounds like a freaking demented freak.  Worse than my eyebrows.  Hokuto-chan~ "Ohhh, I'm so glad it's all over!  I knew SOO-bah-ROO would be fine! Mirei~ "Who are you?" Hokuto-chan~ "I'm Hokuto!  SOO-bah-ROO SOO-murrah-GI's sister!  God help us all.    mood:   drop dead tired  listening to:   Fukai Mori {Inuyasha}    Period Zero~ Geometry Honors    Quote:   Anthony - She can't hear you, she's too busy worshipping the teacher.

Period Tres ~ Fundamentals of Programming    Quote:   Me: {raises hand} Goodman:  {walks over} Me: {runs program} Goodman:  {stands there, totally clueless} Goodman:  Uhh.. oh.  Are you showing me that it runs? Me:  {-_-"}  Yeeees....   What Happened:  We had a lovely lil' FOP test today.  I had to program something that would ask the user into input two numbers.  Then, the smallest number would be the start number for a chart that would go to the bigger number.  The chart would show the numbers as they went up plus if they were odd or even.  THEN, it would count the number of even numbers and spit it out.  WANNA SEE MY PROGRAM?  *gringrin*  #include &lt;iostream.h> #include &lt;winsioux.h> #include &lt;iomanip.h> #include "apstring.h"  apstring comment(int x);  int main() { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int starting, ending; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&lt;&lt;"Enter a starting point:  "; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cin>>starting; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&lt;&lt;"Enter an ending point:  "; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cin&lt;&lt;ending;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int sum=0;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cout&lt;&lt;setw(6)&lt;&lt;"Number"&lt;&lt;setw(30)&lt;&lt;"Comment about number"&lt;&lt;endl; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(int x=starting;x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(x%2==0) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum=sum+1; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum=sum+0;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&lt;&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setw(6)&lt;&lt;x&lt;&lt;setw(30)&lt;&lt;comment(x)&lt;&lt;endl; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&lt;&lt;"There are "&lt;&lt;sum&lt;&lt;" even numbers."&lt;&lt;endl;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIOUXsettings.asktosaveonclose=false; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 0; }  apstring comment(int x) { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(x%2==0) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "even"; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "odd"; }   OUCH, that was a LOT of coding.  Jesus.  I had to bput &amp;nbsp's everywhere and a WHOLE mess of &amp;lt's too... so it wouldn't interpret as a fricking HTML code thing.  -_-    Period Quater ~ PE    Quotes:   Me: Hey.
