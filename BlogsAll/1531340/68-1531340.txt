OK.  Get your asses ready for the most pissed off rant I have EVER made.  Most of the people who know me think I'm mostly jolly-ful.  NOW I'M THE MOST PISSED OFF I WILL EVER BE AT SOMEBODY I'VE ONLY SEEN FOR AN HOUR.    OK.  So we went and played Garey High SChool in Pomona.  I AM PISSED.  I TALKED SHIT THE WHOLE FUCKING GAME.  THOSE BITCHES.  MOST OF THE PEOPLE ON THE TEAM ARE ASIAN, AND ALL THEM BITCHES WERE MEXICAN.  SO ONE OF THEM WAS LIKE, "oOoOoOoo....LOOK, CHINATOWN BROKE LOOSE."  SO WE WERE LIKE, "OoOOOoOOOOooooo.....JAIL BROKE LOOSE."  I HATE THEM.  I HATE THEM.  WE WERE TALKING SMACK ALL DAMN GAME.  FUCK.  SO ONE OF THE GIRLS THREW UP SOME CRAZY SHOT, AND I WAS LIKE, "AHAHHAHAHAHAHA, NO!"  AND THE GAREY GIRL STANDING NEXT TO ME WAS LIKE, "WHAT'D YOU SAY?"  AND I WAS LIKE, "I SAID NO.  SEE, IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF YES.  NO.  N-O, NO.  Y-E-S, YES.  OH SHIT, SORRY, AM I GOING TOO DAMN FAST FOR YOU?  HAVE YOU LEARNED TO SPELL YET?  IF I'M GOING TOO FAST, JUST LET ME KNOW, AND I'LL BE SURE TO BRING IT DOWN A NOTCH.  SEE, I'M JUST NOT SURE HOW FAST MEXICANS ARE ON THE UPTAKE."  AT WHICH POINT WAR STARTED.  TOWARDS THE END, ONE OF MY TEAMMATES, BECCA, DROVE TO THE BASKET AND SOME GAREY GIRL WAS CALLED FOR THE FOUL.  SHE WAS ALL PISSED, SO SHE KICKED BECCA.  AND THEN SHE GOT A FUCKING TECH.  SO OUR GIRL WAS OUT THERE SHOOTING THE FREE THROWS, AND ME AND SOME OTHER GIRL WERE JAWING IT OUT.  BECCA COMES AND STEPS IN-BETWEEN US, AND THE OTHER GIRL WAS LIKE, "AWWW.....HOW CUTE; THE BUDDY SYSTEM?"  AND BECCA, KICK ASS, SHE WAS LIKE, "YUP.  WE ALL LOVE THE BUDDY SYSTEM."  WHICH SHUT THE BASTARD UP GOOD.  AND THEN SO I'M TRYING TO POP THE BALL FROM ONE OF THE PLAYERS, AND SHE WAS LIKE, "GIRL, YOU TRYING TOO HARD."  AND I WAS LIKE, "OH.  MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY HARDER, SEEING AS YOU'RE DOWN BY 20 POINTS!!!"  THOSE BITCHES.  I SWEAR.  AND THEN I WAS ALL PUMPED UP THE FOURTH QUARTER.  I GET FOULED AND SHE LANDS ON MY FOOT.  I FEEL IT ROLL.  THEN SHE GETS UP AND  KICKS  IT.  MY FUCKING GOD.  SO IT'S THE END OF THE GAME, AND OUR COACH WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO START  ANYTHING .  YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND YOURSELVES, BUT YOU ARE NOT THE INSTIGATE ANYTHING."  SO I WALK BY THE BITCH, AND SHE'S LIKE, "OoOOoooOOoO...CRY ME A RIVER."  SO ONE OF MY TEAMMATES WAS LIKE, "WOW, HOW'D YOU KNOW?  I LIKE J. TIMBERLAKE, TOO."  THOSE BITCHES.  I'M JUST SAYING.  WHEN TO PLAY US AT WILSON, THEY BETTER WATCH THEIR ASSES.  FUCK YEAH.
