Baka.  Baka baka baka...  Anyhow, I'm in programming, and I am in a  VERY BAD MOOD .  We have a sub (that's why I'm online) and he's frigging ANNOYING.  He's freaking walking all over the classroom and staring at you as you type.  Goddammit.  He's at the computer across from me right now, so I'm okay.  For the time being anyway.  Oh my god... FOP boy is SO ANNOYING... if he pokes me ONE MORE TIME I will SCREAM.  Maybe I'll actually consider doing what Hannah told me to do.. o.o;;; See what happens.  Heh.  Still wondering why the Lakers couldn't beat the Hornets.. Haha.. Lakers suck.. >.>;;;;  Still can't wait for November 28th.  Come on, you stupid day, GET CLOSER!  ;_;  I've had enough of sensible anime freak deprivation!  Anime Club has... CARTOON NETWORK ANIME FANS IN IT!  *dies and revives*  Anyhow... -.-  I'm so bored... I need.. a knife... must.. kill... o.O;;;;  AAAAAAAAANNNNYYYYYYYYYhow... nobody's joining my fanlisting.  -_-"  Weiss Kreuz music is PRETTY!    JOIN IT JOIN IT JOIN IT PLEEEAAASSEEEE?   Plug of the day is over.. yay.  TT's going to kill me someday.  I spent so much shitting time on that layout, only to screw it all up.. ;_;  Quoth Dionne:  "Dude.. you need a life.  Have you ever considered going, uh.. OUTSIDE to you know.. watch movies and go.. shopping?"  Dionne, I hate shopping.  The last time I went to a movie theater was December 28, 2002.    ... The last movie I've watched outside of theaters was the Weiss Kreuz OVA.  Hahaha.  And part of the Tokyo Babylon movie thingeh when Hannah came over.  I scared her.  MWAHAHHAHAHA.  Drewperson just called WK Waiss Cruise.  I'm going to go insane.  It's WEISS KREUZ!  (VICE KROYZ!)  HOW HARD IS THAT TO GRASP, YOU FREAKING MANGY MORONS?!!!!111oneone!!eononeonene11  Anyhow.. >.>;;;;  Gravitation anime is pretty.  *_*  Gravitation remix is disgusting.  o.o;;;  And Hannah told me to read  Yami no Matsuei .  *blink*  I don't understand YnM!  At all!  *dies*  Is it supposed to be that hard to understand?  The only thing I know about it is that Tsuzukiperson is voiced by Shin'ichirou Miki!  (*_*)  I love Miki-san.... to some extent.  His hair scares me.  He doesn't look human half the time.  Drewperson is calling himself an idiot.  What an idiot.   Later.. after getting back home ^^;;;   It's raining like a mother outside.  There's thunder.  Plus a nationalweatherthingy warning of.. flash floods.  What the hell is a flash flood?  *totally confused*  Anyhow, um... hello.    Join my fanlisting?   *smiles*  If you want to put me in a good mood.. HOLY SHIT IT'S RAINING HARD... you should join it.  XDDDDD  I'm kidding, ya know.   Oh my god.. it's raining.. REALLY, REALLY HARD.  I'm worried.  >.  ;____________________________________________________;  By the way.... just so you know, that... person in FOP?  I will kill him.  Someday.  Yes.  I will.
