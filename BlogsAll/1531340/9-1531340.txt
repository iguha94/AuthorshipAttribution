Bloody shit.  Today was so fucking annoying it wasn't even freaking funny.  And my stupid dad is smoking again.  If I get lung cancer, pin the tail on that motherfucking donkey.  Listening to:   My Will, Other Side of the Moon, Love of My Life, Double Dear, Kiseki no Hana   Geometry H  -  BULLSHIT.  Who gives the freaking SHIT about angles?  Hell, I did when I was in.. second grade, but PLEASE, this is HIGH SCHOOL, not ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.  Give me a damned BREAK!   English 1 H  - I swear, Caitlin, if you bop me on the head one more time with that ugly ass pen, I WILL stop acting like a wounded puppy and more like  you're  Takatori and I'm Ran.  So..fucking..STOP...it.   Geography/NWC  - Three words-  SCREW YOU, FARR.   Programming  - Bloody.  Okay, if I EVER EVER EVER get my hands on that dumbass teacher, I WILL kill him.  I hate the class, hate the people (most of them anyway), and fucking DETEST the teacher.   PE  - It was gay, but bearable.  I can't play tennis.   Latin  - Facking GAY as all hell!  I read "canem" as "cenam", so I put "gustat" instead of "vocat" and so missed that stupid retarded question I would have gotten right otherwise.  And I was SO DAMN CLOSE to a perfect score!  *kicks*   Biology  - Bunch of fundraising crap.  Like I want to raise money for some gayass shit so we can go dissect things.
