Uhhh.  Blogger's publishing coding isn't very Mozilla friendly.  I get an awful lot of gobbledygook (F5 fixes it, but it's not supposed to appear in the first place), which is odd as this thing is supposed to validate...?  Maybe there should be validation standards for PHP and ASP so it's more viewer-friendly.  I'm rambling again.   [ music ]   L'Arc~En~Ciel - Ready Steady Go   [ HONORS GEOMETRY &raquo; 0 ]  AAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHH.  I fell asleep.  Couldn't help it, really.  x_x;  And then I just... did tonight's homework so I wouldn't have to do it tonight.  Wow, did I just break the Code of Procrastination?  *runs from Platypus*   [ ICT &raquo; 1 ]  Yum, subtracting.  Only in ICT will you learn how to subtract zero from one in high school.  The wiring looks awfully complicated for so simple a problem.  -_-;  These people need to simplify it.  Or... make a specialized chip to add.  We have no AND circuits after we lost our board, so I don't know how we're supposed to wire Lab 19.  :(  I still have to draw that diagram.  Fsckydoo.   [ NONWESTERN CULTURES IB &raquo; 2 ]  Ugh, remember the seating discrepancy?  Brian stole my seat.  >=O  But Michael made him move, so it's all good.  And some moron killed Rachel's spork.  *fumes*  Thou shalt not harm the spork!  Oo, and I aced the last reading quiz even though I didn't read.  oO;  Same with Brian, though.  How that kid manages to get 100%'s on all his reading quizzes without ever reading is beyond me.   [ BIOLOGY HONORS/IB &raquo; 3 ]  I... hate... worms.  Hate them.  They scare the living daylights out of me (and I remember that one nightmare when the world was just  crawling  with worms.  Yes.  So I was rather uncomfortable in this class.  Not like anyone cares.   [ PE &raquo; 4 ]  Ehhh... played Ultimate Frisbee. =]  Cristina gave me a bloody bruise.  See, I poked her, so she got mad and "poked" me back.  I swear to Mr. Spork that it wasn't a poke.  I think she dug her fingernail into my skin.  xO;  It still hurts when I touch it.  x.x;;   [ LATIN &raquo; 5 ]  Ewwww.  We had Miss Onstad for a sub (This would be the  third  time this month.  $#@$@!) and I finished the classwork in fifteen minutes.  So I did the Romeo & Juliet Act 3 study guide in its entirety and then sat there and averted my eyes from Heaven, who was dancing like a whore.  Not like that's anything  new .    Oooo... and the translation was wrong again, only... it was really bad  (complete with petting, rods, and vibrabat [which actually means brandishing, but I didn't know that at first]).  x]  I was the only person who laughed.  Ehhhh.  o_o?  I blame Cecilia for mentioning petting as a sexual practice yesterday.  Don't ask.   [ ENGLISH &raquo; 6 ]  Mm, Hikki's new single is playing-- Er.  Hookai.  So.  Romeo and Juliet.  Yes, again.  I'm still standing by what Elyse said yesterday.
