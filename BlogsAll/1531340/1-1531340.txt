Lalala, Elfie wanted Platypus to bloggie so Platypusie will do so...haha, Platypus in good mood!  Lalala, in first period everyone was running around everywhere...haha, I looked so informal today. But that was nothing compared to what Andrew Chen was wearing.  He was wearing jeans, crappy shoes, and a discolored shirt.  I was wearing dress pants and an unbaggy shirt.  *big improvement*  I even remembered to bring Mrs. Mekenian's pencil that I borrowed for the Disneyland trip.  Haha, so me, Elfie, Chicken, Monkey, and Mini Minnie Driver are walking around then Ms. Girkin comes and goes, "Genius."  So I turn around and follow her (not before dragging all of my little group with me) to Mekenian's class.  And then there's Mrs. Mekenian standing right there wtih a little baggie for me.  Then Chicken couldn't keep it in any longer and was like, "It's a Derek Fisher jersey!"  Yeah, it took me forever to find the dang thing, there was so much wrapping paper.  OMG, the stuffing tissue taught you how to draw Bugs Bunny!  Then I gave Mrs. Mekenian a hug.  Wait, I think she's the one who hugged ME.  Yeah.  I don't think I hugged anyone...x)  Man, everyone was crying today...stupid Vonne took our class's tissue...it was reserved for the Class of 2003...she's the class of 2004.  Haha....  I saw Elfie's parents driving her home!  Yeah, they were LATE!  Geez...it was 2:50!  *gasp*  SO LATE!  (that WAS sarcastic, by the way, numbskulls)
