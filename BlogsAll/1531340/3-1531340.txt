Mini @ 3:30 or so:   All right.  So I'm staring at Platypus' post and I've been blinded... MY little Spurs?  The Spurs can go to hell for all I care!  And no, I'm not in a good mood.  Did it honestly take you that long to notice?  Are you honestly that deluded?  Are you?  Piss me off.     Mini @ 3:35, after screwing up the blog template:  My aunt came back from New York today, bringing what has to be the ugliest skirt on the planet along with easily the ugliest blouse.  She made me wear it, and I swear I look like I'm from the 60's or something.  And then she tells me that it's pretty and I should wear it to promotion.  Hel-LO?!  I may be completely against this whole promoting morons thing but wear a dress that looks like that?!!!!!!!!!  Actually, stop at dress.  Wear a DRESS?!!!!  I got so pissed I yelled at my mom and she insisted that I wear it.  So I suffocated myself under the blankie and yelled at both of them to get outta my room, close the door, and back off. And my mom just said, "Fine, we'll go."   And then I yelled back, "YOU DO THAT."  So now she just threw a bowl of fruit at me and I swear she poisoned it, so I'm eating it so I don't have to go to promotion.    And then my frickin' internet isn't opening my web page correctly, even after I checked the entire damn thing for JavaScript and CSS errors.  I am so mad right now, it's not even funny.  -_-"  Oh, and by the way, Platypus... your beloved Nets lost on Sunday.  You should know that... tsk tsk.  You know what?  I plan to be ornery today.  GO SPURS.  KICK THE NET'S ASSES! NYYEHHH...   I'M GONNA DROWN MYSELF IN MY DVD NOW.  PAH.  COOKIE MONSTER IS NOW A COMPLETE MONSTER.   If you want good news, go find my frickin' mom and aunt.  They'll gush over how pretty the goddamn outfit is.  Bullshit.
