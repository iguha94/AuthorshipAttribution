Yay!  What fun.  We played Mark Keppel today.  My god, their golf team is so good you don't even know.  Holy shitake!  One of the girls shot a 35 and one shot a 34.  The lowest score in our group was a 48!  Their highest score was a 45!  OMFG.  I don't even believe this.  Apparently, they're ranked third in all of Southern California.  That's scary.  I can't imagine anyone playing better than they do...and I was with their worst player.  OMFG.  Bio H - what fun.  Dimensional analysis test tomorrow, lab is due.  Load of bull dung.  English 1H - Yay!  Tomorrow's teacher will be the sub's sub's sub's sub.  What fun.  Ceramics - Eh...............  Algebra 2H - POW's!  Test tomorrow.  I have a B in the class. I'm going to cry.  That means that in order for me to get an A on the progress report, I have to ace my next two tests and quizzes.....................  Drama - What fun.  We did entrances today!  Yay.  I burst through the door and almost died...  World History H - Yay!  I was a peasant again....when we read our stupid proposal to solve France's economical problems, that son of a bitch bastard who thinks he's all cool just because he plays the king was like, "Treason!  Off with their heads."  So then I was like, "Hell yeah, you do that.  Who the mother f*** are you going to get to make FOOD in your country?  Will it be you, you little dumbass?  All you know how to do is sit on you goddamn throne and be a fucking jackass!"  Omg, NOW I'M PISSED.    Golf - I just told you about it.  At the beginning, remember?  Oh, wtf, nevermind.  Yay!  Off early tomorrow.  Go home and sleepieful.  Actually, no.  I go to Mesa and flaunt the fact that I'M allowed on campus and THEY'RE not.  Screw Troy.  They're off tomorrow.
