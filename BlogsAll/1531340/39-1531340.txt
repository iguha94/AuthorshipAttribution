School sucks.  And I finally updated   Tiny Tenshi !  FINALLY!  xD   Mood:   Proud of myself  Listening to:   Tomorrow   Period 0 - Geometry Honors:   Oh lord.  We got out Quick Quiz results today.  Out of twelve problems, I managed to get  five  correct.  Five!  Wow.  I really need to get studying, ne?  But I can't memorize things and that's what Geometry  is !  A bunch of postulates and theorems!  *sob*  I'll never get into a good college...   Period 1 - English 1 Honors:   We took a quiz on  Of Mice and Men  chapter three.  'Twas stupid.  I failed it because I mixed up Crooks and Candy, and also because I didn't know why Curley's wife married Curley.  Physical attraction?  *shrug*   Period 2 - Geography/Non Western Cultures IB:   This class is a load of bull.  Farr thinks I do good on homework.  Sankyuu, Miss Farr.  -_- Failin' everything else though.  Luuurvely.   Period 3 - Fundamentals of Programming (Tech):  Ahahaha.  More if & else statements.  I think I understand it now.  I made a guessing game using file extensions (GIF, JPG, PNG, PHP, SHTML, CSS, HTML).  It was complicated and took me the whole damned period to finish.  Dionne made a stupid one with colors.  Bah.   Period 4 - PE:   OH MY GOD.  Life is so unfair.  Just because a bunch of  morons  wouldn't hurry up and get into their lines, we had to run laps.  >.   Period 5 - Latin:   We took a quizzie!  It was stupid.  Then we watched a movie about this guy that falls in love with this prostitute who's next door in the whore house who just happens to be a virgin.  And the prostitute thinks that the guy's dad is her owner, so she starts seducing him.  It's really wrong.   Period 6 - Biology:   *sings* Notes, notes, notes, notes, notes...
