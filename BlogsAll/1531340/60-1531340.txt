Mood:  Pissed.  Off.  Music:  "Monochrome ni somariyuki machi de" by Takehito Koyasu as Zazel  Currently:  Bitching.  About.  Everything.  Currently At:  Home  Right, and if that fucking ass "New hardware detected" shit comes up again, I will take a sledgehammer and destroy my computer.  I'm that pissed.  It has something to do with the tests and quizzes today coupled with Animeniacs' failed delivery of my soundtracks.  Do I sound selfish to you?  I'm sorry, do you think I  care ?  I'm seriously close to tears right now, and I will explode if anything else happens.  So, if you have bad news, save it for next year when I'm not so stressed and unwilling to cooperate with any carbon-based life form that contacts me.   GEOMETRY:   First test of the day.  I think I passed, barring the first twenty problems.  Oh yeah...   ENGLISH:  Grammar final.  70 questions.  I think I got.. maybe.. .a 60.   HISTORY:   World War I exam.  It was easy as hell.  Except Farr can't format for shit.  The columns were all off and crap.  It's not like it's  that  hard to use Microsoft Word, moron.   PROGRAMMING:   Goodman, do us all a favor AND SHUT YER BLOODY TRAP.   PE:  Badminton.  And because Charmaine wasn't here,  AGAIN  (She hasn't been in all week.  Am I worried?  Not really.), I had to play iwth David.  Which wasn't actually bad, until we had to play against Louden, who's the freaking most talkative bastard in the universe.   LATIN:  Stage 10 test.  Stupid.   BIOLOGY:   Test on RNA and DNA.  I found a mistake and didn't bother to report it, figuring I could bitch about it later if I got it wrong.  Something about a DNA codon with AGU (AUG?  I forget.)  Anyway, it's the start codon on mRNAs, and couldn't possibly be DNA because DNA doesn't have uracil in it.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.   Don't even try messing with me today.
