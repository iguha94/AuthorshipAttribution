Dad:   So, I heard you and your friends were planning another reunion.  Me:   Errrrm.. ( DAMN!  How did he know?! ) yes....  Dad:   Is it at the same house again?  Me:   ( Oh crap.. he's going to mention the not sleeping thing... )  Yes....  Dad:   Okay.  That's fine by me.  Me:   ^_____________________________________^  What?  I was really afraid he would say no because he almost killed me last time for not sleeping.  Anyhow.   mood:   stupid..piano...  listening to:   Tomorrow {Weiss Kreuz} & Sadame (full) {X}     Period 0 - Geometry Honors:     What I Learned:   Triangles look PRETTY outlined in HOT PINK.  What Happened:   Oiiiii.  I forgot to do my homework yesterday and we had a pop quiz.  The question?  Copy numbers 4 & 7 from your homework w/out looking at the book.  X_X  I'm DEAD, boysies and girlies...  Then Rasch was teaching us how to prove triangles congruent and was outlining the stupid things in her *hot pink* white board marker.  I hate that color.     Period 1 - English 1 Honors:     What I Learned:   Jim can't play Tetris.  What Happened:   Ms. Lewis didn't come!  x_X  So I didn't have to slave over my lit log yesterday!  *grrrrr*  We just took the etymologies quizzle and the grammar quizzle.  Damn.  For once, I'm glad I did grammar homework in Mears.  Because the last time we did prepositional phrases before that was in... what... 5th grade?  Not like I learned anything in Mears' class.  Bah.  And Jim was playing Tetris on his TI-83.  His highest score?   1740 .  What a riot.  That's worse than me, and that's saying a lot.  *coughhighestscore25000somethingcough*     Period 2 - Geography/Nonwestern Cultures IB     What I Learned:   ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  What Happened:   Uggggh.  I hate this class!  It was so stupid.  All we did was stare at propaganda posters from Iran denouncing the United States and Soviet Union.  And the annoying prepubescent male population of the class was screaming out "STALIN!" in their nondeveloped squeaky voices.  Stalin never freaking showed up, you morons.     Period 3 - Fundamentals of Programming:     What I Learned:   Getting hit by a piece of paper is annoying.  What Happened:   Stupid.  Stupid stupid stupid stupid.  I didn't have my sweatshirt today, so Goodman caught me with my CD player on.  *bangs head on keyboard*  Not like it mattered.  He hates me already.  No brownie points for me, yay.  And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm the ONLY FREAKING PERSON in that row that can START a program without crying out for his help or someone else's help.     Period 4 - PE:     What I Learned:   Pushups are freaking PAINFUL.  What Happened:   Fitness Friday.  GAAAAAH.  Do you have any idea how PAINFUL Fitness Friday is?

Haaaaaaaaah.     Lunch - Latin Club    Ooh yay.. free pizza.. >__________     Period 5 - Latin     What I Learned:   The Easter Bunny stands for reproduction!  Hence the term 'f*** like rabbits'!  What Happened:   Lots of translating.  And a couple of lame ghost stories.  Made all the lamer by the fact that they were in Latin.  I mean, isn't that supposed to make it doubly exciting?  Dead story in dead language?  Yes.. no.. fine, be that way.     Period 6 - Biology     What I Learned:   Caitlin BUGS.  What Happened:   Lab. LAAAAAAAAb.  BORING LAB.
