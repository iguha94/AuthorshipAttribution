Bloody heck.  Okay, today was freaking terrible and so I'll start out with nice, child-oriented words and then comes the onslaught of something... really terrible.  O-kay.   mood:  PISSED  listening to:  Spiritualized {Weiss Kreuz}   WHAT I LEARNED TODAY:  Period 0 - Geometry :  You see, there are these nifty things called TRIANGLES.  Some of them are the SAME.  These are called CONGRUENT.   Period 1 - English : If you squeeze someone's hand too hard, it explodes! Period 2 - NWCultures : Poor little Yemen is poor. Period 3 - Fundamentals of Programming : How to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich:  You gather your materials.  Then you put your materials on the bread.  Then you put the bread together, and voila, you've got a PB&J sandwich.  Period 4 - PE: 1-2-3-4-T-1-2-3-4-R-1-2-3-4-O-1-2-3-4-Y-1-2-3-4-TROY! Period 5 - Latin : Her name is Melissa.  She coquits bene, cantats prettily, and is very sapiens. Period 6 - Biology : Take a sandwich, and BAM!  you have a plasma membrane.   Warning.  STRONG language ensues... -_-  Highlight to read.     Oh my god.. my mom is so fucking annoying!  She freaking was looking in my room and found my fucking music theory, which I didn't fucking do because I had too much shitty HOMEWORK.  So now she's all pissed at me.  She can fucking go to hell for all I care.  And she's all screaming at me because of my attitude.  Well FUCK OFF, bitch, and I won't bother you AT ALL.  Shit!  She's SO FUCKING ANNOYING.  If she EVER sees this blog, she can fucking cry all she wants.  Oh.  And she thinks I'm STARVING MYSELF.  WHAT THE FUCK?  I wouldn't starve myself if you PAID me to do it.  Jesus Christ.  I  cannot  live without sugar.  Okay?  I eat chocolate bars by the DOZEN.  And bitch, you think I'm STARVING myself to become THIN?  If you had paid any attention at all to me, I gave up trying to lose weight AGES ago.  Besides, I'm not even overweight......  ... yet.  BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT, SEE.   I just DETEST being called anorexic and/or bulemic when the whole of Troy High School is skinner than I am.  It's freaking ANNOYING.  I weigh.. what.. 115 pounds?  110?  105?  Who cares?  It's over 100.  For sure.  And I got SO MAD I got Spiritualized stuck in my head.    Again.    My little rant is over.  Good bye.
