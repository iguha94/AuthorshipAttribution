Me tired.  *nodnod*  Lookie the DOUBLE NOD.  Didn't do nothing much....oOooo IT WAS FUN MAKIN FUN OF STEF, though.  LOL.  Period 0:  We worked on the stupid matrix thing.  Lovely.  Contraceptives!  I DO NOT CARE.  Whatever.  WE HAVE A TEST ON TUESDAY.  Yeah, Ima study for that shit.  Period 2: We tested for the stupid CAT6 state reading language arts thing.  I didn't get the horse-boy thing....  It was kinda weird.  Me did not get.  And that thing about the Grape Dance?  ELFIE, I think we should write to them and complain about them taking off the truck and salt and pepper questions.  Then we went into second period...my car broke!  But it's OKAY!! The talented Platypus fixed it!  Period 4: Went over our scene.  We are SO SCREWED OVER.  HAhaha Jackie was SUPER pissed off.  I don't blame her, though.  I'd be ticked off if I were her.  LOL  We kept messing up.  Scene goes up TUESDAY o.O  Lunch: Kekek.  First thing I saw was Stef coming toward me going, "I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU!!!"  LOL.  Buttcrack.  What the hell were you waiting for, Stef?  You KNEW they were going to win.  Haha.  Why the heck you forgive Jody, eh?  You leave me with TRACEY?  So yeah.  STef's not talking to me because the LAKERS WONNNNNNED!  LOL.  More story.  I was DRUNK during lunch today  LOL.   xDDDD  I finished eating and I was facing the carts.  Being the awesome citizen I am, I look for a trashcan.  That's what they're FOR, LITTERBUGS!  So I see one on either side of me, both equidistant.  So I head right.  LOL Jei says it's gay.  So I walk all 40 steps there and back and when I get back Speedo goes, "You know there was a trash can RIGHT THERE, don't you?"  She's pointing right next to Mrs. Cheng's cart.  XDDD.  End of storytime.  Period 6: We had conditioning....with EIGHT people.  We played 3 on 2.  Me and Christina lost *nodnod*.  What the hell did you expect, eh?  haha.  Mrs. Cheng took us home.
