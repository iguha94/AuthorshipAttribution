Oiiiiii.  My ass hurts.  No seriously, it does.  Period 0 - Biology H:  Shit....lecture.  Man, WACKO.  BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING.  Period 1 - English 1 H:  Tooked a test on the Human Comedy.  Missed the last question.  Who the hell KNOWS what Willliam Saroyan won for his ickle play The Times of the Year?  Moreover, who the hell cares?!?  Period 2 - Ceramics:  F***ed around the entire period....................I gotta glaze all four projects tomorrow.  Period 3 - Algebra 2 H:  Yay.  More arithmetic series and sequences.  Period 4 - Drama:  An all-over boring period.  LUNCH - MIX IT UP DAY. Hell, we went to take Interact pictures first.  Then we went around talking to other people for MIX IT UP DAY, just to find a damn sticker!  I wanted a sticker.  We finally got one.  Damn.  We told the sports editor that Laura Higashi could dunk.  He knew her brother, and he was like, "No, are you shitting me?"  Shit, it was funny.  We were like, "No, seriously, dude, she's got hops.  She can dunk."  LOL.  Period 5 - World History H:  Test on "Nectar in a Sieve."  I got a 10/25.  That's better than I hoped for.  I hoped for a 5.  Period 6 - Basketball:  Man, we were breaking the press.  Laura (the DUNKER) threw a lob pass.  Seriouly, it was so far over me I really had to elevate to get it.  I'm in midair, and this one sophmore (Patrice) jumped INTO me in the opposite direction, so I landed hella hard on the side of my ass.  Shit.  So for the rest of practice, I sat on the sidelines.  Then Ed comes over with a big bag of ICE and tells me to put it up my shorts.  So I sit there for the rest of practice with an ice bag basically up my ass.  After practice, I took it out and tried to walk outside.  Man, IT HURT.  LOL.  xDDDDDDDDD.
