My dad is in a bad mood.  And speaking of my dad, he has attitude problems.  They're worse than mine, and that's saying freaking a lot.   Period 0 - Geometry Honors:   A test.  I finished it, then I did English homework.  I hate this class.   Period 1 - English 1 Honors:  Etymology quiz and then a bunch of crap I failed to understand because I wasn't really listening at all... oops.   Period 2- Non-western Cultures IB:   This class was stupid.  We had to choose things for the peace conference, and I'm officially of the Likud Bloc Party.  Whatever that is.   Period 3 - Fundamentals of Programming:   The networking was screwed, so I just typed up my program in an e-mail.  Yaaaay.  It was stupid.  I couldn't even listen to my music because there were two teachers in the classroom.  And to make matters worse, when I took out my binder I sliced my finger along the edge.  My pinky has a schism in it.  It hurts.   Homecoming Rally:   It was so unbearably pointless.  All they did was parade the homecoming court nominees down a red carpet with bright lights and play outdated pop music in the background.  Those NJROTC people had nice swords though.. *grin*   Period 4 - PE:  Oh gawd... I was totally insane during PE.  I think I ate too much chocolate, because I seriously could NOT stop giggling and laughing.  Me:   I can't *giggle*  stop *giggle* laughing!  Charmaine:   Think of someone dying.  Me:  *bursts out laughing*  Charmaine:   You're EVIL! But I stopped laughing soon, because Homer made us do (1) 20 jumping jacks (2) daily stretches (3) a set of Coach Homer jacks (jumping jacks like this:  1-2-3-C-1-2-3-O-1-2-3-A-1-2-3-C-1-2-3-H-1-2-3-H-1-2-3-O-1-2-3-M-1-2-3-E-1-2-3-R-1-2-3-Coach Homer!)  (4) 30 pushups (5) 60 crushes (6) 6 laps around the gym.  My poor pinky.   Period 5 - Latin:   NUFFINK.   Period 6 - Biology:   Accck!  *tears out hair*  I got a C+ on said 68 problem test EVEN WITH A 65 problem curve!  GAAAAAAH!
