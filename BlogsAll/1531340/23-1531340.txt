Blah blah blah.  I need a domain.  x_X  And I have a headache.   mood:   blaaaah.  listening to:   Back to Heaven {Weiss Kreuz}     Period zero: Geometry Honors     On a scale of 1 to 10, this class was a  2.  Quote:    Rasch: Okay, I'm not going to be here tomorrow, Coach-- Everyone:  YYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY! Rasch: . . .   What Happened:   *snickers*  Loser.  Anyhow, we had a quiz.  >______     Period One : English 1 Honors     On a scale of 1 to 10, this class was a  5.  Quote:   {watching a shitty World War 1 movie} Ms. Lewis:  Yeah, this is pretty gruesome.  Sorry, I couldn't find the one I wanted. Jim:  Erg.. there's a lot of blood. Person:  It's black and white blood!  It looks like water, for heaven's sake. Me:  Oi.  Black and white blood can be scary.  Go read X, dammit.   What Happened:   We watched a majorly shitty (and old)  WWI movie.  How old?  Well, the guy narrating had a lisp, and the sound technicians sucked so much the background music was louder than the damned narrator.  Plus they all had British accents.  British accents + lisp = nonintelligible conversation.     Period Two : Nonwestern Cultures IB     On a scale of 1 to 10, this class was a  2.  What Happened:   Ugh.  This class was so terrible I was in maaaaajor genocidal mode by the end of it.  Those crapping idiots wouldn't freaking SHUT THEIR HOLES!  It was SO annoying.  I seriously wanted to kill half the people in my class.  I was throwing knives at their heads in my imagination.  I'm serious.  Dead serious.     Period Three : Fundamentals of Programming     On a scale of 1 to 10, this class was a  7.  What Happened:  Crap.  Text files are a pain in the butt when you're not used to saving them as text files.  I found myself naming the file I needed  .shtml  on accident.  >__ Be back later  thing up or that would have been back.  x_X  To be continued when my headache goes away.  Ouchie.
