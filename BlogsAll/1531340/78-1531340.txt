I'm back.  :)  Today sucked.  Yay.  Argh, Troy is having some "Find your soulmate!" crap so they made us take a test thing.  I found my soulmate through Kathy, who decided to tell me the name of the poor guy who is apparently stuck with me for life.  What bull.  I pity any girl who has Nelson on her list of soulmates.  Such horrors.    Period 0 :: Geometry Honors  I.. failed.. the first.. test.. of.. the..semester.  I don't know HOW I did it, but I did.  Dude, I lost ten points for not showing work *alone.*  Bitch.  I did too show work.  In my fucking HEAD.  Who needs to subtract 38 from 180 on paper?  Not me.   Period 1 :: ICT  Ooooo.. we're going to get our wiring crap tomorrow.  XP  Time for me to rig people's boards so they get shocked when they touch 'em.. [nasty smile]   Period 2 :: History  A movie on China under Mao!  I hate how Farr pronounces his name.  Goddammit.  The video had testimony in Chinese, which was awesome because I wasn't one of the people staring at the screen all blankly and crap.  W00t.   Period 3 :: Biology  Test tomorrow.   Period 4 :: PE  Yaaaay no more hurdles!  XD  We're doing the 400 meter dash/sprint now.  Whoop-de-doo.   Period 5 :: Latin  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH.  Board games.  Roman board games.   Period 6 :: English   Simon is the Christ figure.  He stumbled  three times  before dying.  He comes to deliver  great news  but people put him down and  KILL HIM .   Therefore, he is Christ.    What bull.
