Today was just... weird.  I think... I'm going to DIE... yep.  Back to my little.. blog format thingeh.  Haaaaaaah.   Mood:  Pissed  Music:  "Kawaita Sakebi" by Field of View  Random Thought:  Field of View shouldn't have disbanded.. ;_;  They're so awesome.  Currently:  Typing this.  And listening to FoV.   High:  That biology test was the easiest one all year!  XD  I think that I got a C!  { jumps up and down }  Oh, great.  Now I sound like.. Platypus.  >.>;;;  Low:  I know I failed that stupid geometry test.  Those proofs were  not  in English.  -_-"  At least, if they were, not a form of English that I understand.  Ha.  Ha. Ha.  -________-"   Period 0 - Geometry H  As I said, we had a test today.  It was... ha.  I could  not  figure out for the life of me how to prove those idiotic segments were congruent.  It was.. CONFUSING!  *nods*   Period 1 - English 1 H  @____@  This class wasn't that bad because Lewis is like.. my favorite teacher so far.  I actually passed the reading check quiz.  The first one I've passed all year, yay!   Period 2 - NWC  Nick wore a dress!  XDDDDD  That was the highlight of the period, I swear.  Everything else sucked.  Farr laughed at herself so many times I felt like whacking her with my binder.  My pretty, pretty binder.  *__________*  Jumped over the desk and sprinted outside the second the bell rang.  { blows raspberry }  I don't want to talk to you guys.  Shoo!   Period 3 - FOP  ... I finished the rock, paper, scissors crap yesterday.  So I just spent the entire period on the Plaza.  Sorta.  I had to keep closing the screen because Goodman kept coming.  He caught me.  But he didn't say anything.  ^_____^;;;;;   Period 4 - PE  Oh my god. DEATH.  Today was.. HORRID.  I would rather run a mile than do what we did.  My legs are still sore.  STUPID, STUPID PE.  Usually, on 'Fun Fitness Friday' we only run about 25-30 yard sprint/skipping/stupidlittlethingeh distances, but we did 40 yards for five minutes.  Actually, here's what we did.  Bite me, Homer.    Five 4-count jumping jacks  10 pushups  25 crunches  Five 4-count jumping jacks  10 pushups  25 crunches  Five 4-count jumping jacks  10 pushups  25 crunches  Stupid sprints for five minutes  Half a mile... (but get this)    1/8 mile  Stop, do 20 situps  1/8 mile  Stop, do 10 pushups  1/8 mile  Stop, do 20 situps  1/8 mile  Stop, do 10 pushups    Walk around the track until the bell rang   X___________X I hate PE.  There were pebbles in my shoe.  >.>;;;;     Lunch  We just went to the wishing well.  And... sat there.  And made fun of Gunn.  Because he went into Knox's room.  And he does that everyday.  Is he in love with Mr. Knox?  o.o;;;   Period 5 - Latin  I hate Latin.  I hate the people in my class. They're so.. shallow!  There's this majorly retarded junior named Heaven who bugs the living SHIT out of me.  Good God, does that girl have a  brain ?  Like, at ALL?  She is the MOST preppy, MOST slutty, and MOST brainless person in the entire universe.  ... Plus, she thinks she's pregnant.   Period 6 - Biology  Sticky icky photosynthesis test.  Haha.  Owie.    Yesterday after school was awesome.  Went home, killed myself, did some homework, studied a little.. got bombarded with IMs from Platypus telling me that Derek Fisher made the All Star ballot (!!)...  I didn't vote for him though.  XDDDD  Most of the people I voted for were Mavericks  (   ... Okay, that's me over with.
