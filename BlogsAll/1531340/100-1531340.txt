Before you get all proud of me for blogging  two days in a row  (Mein Gott.) let it be known that I'm procrastinating.  XD  AIM, Photoshop, and (now) blogging: the  ultimate  form of procrastination.  Seeing as I have three blogs I actively participate in.  =3  ... This is random, but BoA (Kwon) has a sixth grade education and she's 17/18.  Whoopsydaisy.   [music]  Three Days Grace - Scared   [ HONORS GEOMETRY ~ period zero ]  Uhhhh.  Yes.  This class was very... erm...  DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH .  Oh yes.  >>;  I mean, seriously.  "Let's plot rectangles on rectangular coordinate planes!"  Bite me, bitch.  And Nelson needs to wash his hair.  Why, oh  why  do I have to sit behind him?   [ ICT ~ period one ]  BWAHAHA.  I made An rewire Lab 17 (Eh.. the last lab she wired was.. 12, I think.  The one with the D flip-flops. And before that... erm.. lab 3?) and it didn't work. -.-;  But at least Allen got it to function after some.. er.. wire tweaking.  I'm going to go draw out Lab 18 and 19 later as further forms of procrastination, because drawing out diagrams for labs is fun.  =D   [ NONWESTERN CULTURES IB ~ period two ]  Rainforest conference!  It was stupid and I ended up just defacing the sign.  I 'ave to be a SETTLER.  And then Farr screwed up the seating charts, so she slammed the RANCHERS sign on my desk.  I'm a SETTLER, damn it.  A SETTLER.   [ BIOLOGY IB ~ period three ]  Um.  Sponges.  Yes.  I fell asleep.  On accident, I swear.  And then I woke up and took notes, but people copied from my notes.  Poo.   [ PHYSICAL EDUCATION ~ period four ]  The PE classes swam today, only I couldn't because... yes, that.  Anyhow, so I walked around the pool for the entire period and got funny looks.  But an awful lot of people forgot their swimming stuff, so I was nowhere near being alone.  =)  That was pretty cool.  I lapped a few people six times, and we weren't even running or anything.  It's amazing how slowly people walk now.  Um, yes.  Now I have to write a two page, single-spaced, Times New Roman, twelve-point, half-inch margin essay on the importance of physical education.  Homer is such a twit.   [ LUNCH ]  AAAAARGH.  Sheila, Cristina, and Emily spent FOREVER changing after the swimming thing, so we were beyond uberlate for the Anime Club meeting.  Which turned out to be  fine , because the morons (Stupid Caitlin.) decided to watch  Inuyasha .  You shoulda seen me twitch.   [ LATIN ~ period five ]  I have come to the sound conclusion that the writers of our textbook are sheltered, archaic human beings.  There is more innuendo in this thing than in Iowa's cornfields.  Because, no, they cannot wave spears or pitchforks like any other mobs, they must wave  rods  and  sticks .  And slave girls please people an awful lot.  I'm quite sure they only mean "delighted," though, judging by the-- [cringe] illustrations.  Still.  Innuendo abound.    Next thing you know we'll learn Latin for "petting" and the book'll be full of it.  By the way, the most common "insulting" phrase in the book?   I don't give a hoot about--    [ ENGLISH ~ period six ]  Romeo and Juliet will  burn .  Summed up nicely by Elyse: "I think Rosaline should've killed Romeo and then tricked Juliet into falling off a cliff."  There ya go.  Romeo and Juliet= SOLVED!  Ya think maybe the nun Ran bribed at the end of  Gluhen  is Rosaline?  (Dude, it's workable.  I mean... hello?  Weiss?  Plot hole!)
