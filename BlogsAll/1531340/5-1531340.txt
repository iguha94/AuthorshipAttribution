I love you, Kaiba.  *shnuggle*  No, not really.  Not in a good mood.  Some frickin' moron wrote a yaoi fic and didn't label it in large letters again.  This time, I was warned.  Ha!  The second I saw the word "blush,"  I closed the browser.  Thank God.  Because when I went back to that site (it was a individually run fansite) I see this tiny itty bitty 4 point lettering say "Caution: Serious Yaoi".    PRAISE THE LORD.  Ah, well.  Let's see... Photoshop's being wonderful.  It's loading five times as fast on XP then on 98, which is really making me very happy.  I have yet to get used to XP's layout but I will... someday.  Soon, I hope.   I wonder if Blogger will let me put a whole mess of HTML markup in a post.  Hmmmmmmm........  Oh well.  I already messed up the layout anyway.  Which reminds me.  I must go fix it to correspond with some changes I made in my site.     Edit : Oi.  Now I'm in a  really  pissed off mood.  My frickin' mom was looking at the bloggy thing *because she used my comp*  EXCUSE MOI... but this is MY comp.. there's a frickin' reason why I have this password protected.  Hel-lo?!  I am  so  changing her account to limited access...  And she was like all suspicious going "Who's Kaiba?"  *see first line of blog*  And I just stared at her going "WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?"  And she wants proof that he's not a real person... so I had to frickin' show her all my kaiba pics (she was freaked out by the green haired one.. MWAHAHHAHAH) AND I had to go on to that lame KidsWB YGO site and show her that Seto Kaiba's an anime character.  There's a downside to being a Kaiba fan... maybe I should start putting "I love the Dark Magician" all over the frickin' place and then my mom can shut her yapping hole up for all I care... or maybe "I luv Kuriboh..."  or even more tragic "I LOVE THE MILLENNIUM ROD."  Oi.  That sounded ... weeird..  >_  PISS ME OFF.
