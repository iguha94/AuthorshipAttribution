I'm STILL sick!  Arghness!  And yesterday my DVDs came.  They came!  My beautiful, beautiful DVDs came!  Weeee!  *stares at cover*  *again*  *again*     mood:   coughing  listening to:   Look of Love {Crashers Knight and Ran}    -->  Geometry Honors    quote:   Rasch:  And so... Me:  *coughs* Rasch:  let me take.. Me: *coughs* Rasch:  out my... Me: *coughs* Michael:  HOT PINK! Everyone:  *coughs*   class:  Gawd.  I left my geometry book in Latin yesterday, so I kind of didn't have it when we were doing warmups from the book.  And I forgot my pencil box/bag/pouch thing at home.  Eaargh.  So I just sat there, coughing, while everyone else was being good and doing their work.    --> English 1 Honors    quote:   Jim:  But.. the voices in my head.. they're telling me so much! Ms.  Lewis:  There's medication for that, Jim. Me:  I have that problem.  But my mom won't let me get it! Ms.  Lewis:  ... Me:  The medication, I mean.   class:   *cough*  Now that seriously reminded me of CTY.  Yeesh.  What with the voices and faces popping up out of nowhere.  Gotta love the tree smack in the middle of the cafeteria that no one could see but the cult.. eargh!  Plus Caitlin wants to borrow my precious  YuGiOh  DVDs.  I said yes, but if she even SCRATCHES one disk, I  will  kill her.  Yes, I will.    --> Nonwestern Cultures IB    quote:   Nick:  We still haven't found Osama, huh? Taylor:  He's in Mexico! Nick:  Hey, you know Tupac is actually DMX?  They have the same tattoos and the same voice! Zane:  Tupac's dead. Taylor:  No he's not, he's in Mexico!   class:  Farr passed out photocopied notes today, and she still managed to talk the ENTIRE class period.  Oh my GOD, the boredom.    -->  Fundamentals of Programming    quote:   Kathy:  Yay, we get to work on computers now! Me:  ... Fun for the whole family. Kathy:  What the.. ?!   class:  I hate this class.  Really, I do.  My FOP computer hates me.  It does.  It really, really does.    -->PE    quote:   Homer:  Okay, so since the sophomores got you last time, on the count of three, you're all going to chant "SOPHOMORES REALLY SUCK!"  Not like I condone that or anything...   class:  Nation ball again.  We played that last week, and when the sophomores won they screamed FRESHMEN SUCK at us.  So we won --twice!-- today, and at the end we all yelled "SOPHOMORES REALLY SUCK!" at the sophomores, who were running out of the gym to escape the embarrassment.  Bwahahaha.  Sophomores must die.      -->Latin    Ms Kline:  And it's that time of the day again, for...  DERIVATIVE FUN DAY! Abraham:  Oh joy. Ms.  Kline:  It's so much fun!' Abraham:  Oh no, Ms.  Kline, don't give us the worksheet.  We don't deserve so much fun! Ms. Kline:  Aww, yes you do.  Deritavative fun day is FUN!   class:  Derivatives.  Die.  Die.  Die.
