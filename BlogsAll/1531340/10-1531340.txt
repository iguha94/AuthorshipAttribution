Nonono.  POW stands for Problem Of the Week.  But yes, I do feel like a damn prisoner of war about that shitake.  Oii.  We went and played a par 3 today.  'Twas quite fun.  Too bad I screwed up every other time.  Ha.  Biology H - Pinned my buggos today.  It was....um...interesting, for lack of a better word.  My mothie's head FELL OFF.  For crying out loud, that hella annoyed me half to death.  Man, I was ticked off.  I still gots to kill about three buggies.  Dammit, that doesn't sound nice at all.  Not nice.  Period.  Oii.  That's pissing me off, too.  Gots to write up a labbie...gots to tell how you can tell what kind of material that shit is made of.  Here's a way: blackmail it outta your teach.  That's what I be doing.  Yay! And as far as me and Chicken can tell, I've got the highest grade so far.  English 1 H - What fun.  So far, we've had 4 subs in the same week.  Except we had Mrs. Cook, and she just about assigned all that she possibly could.  Mr. John Eckman was like, "Can a sub actually assign that much crap to do?"  Yay.  We have a comprehensive test from Chapters 1 through 15, and a vocab test from 9 through 15.  TOO BAD WE NEVER GOT THE DAMNED VOCAB WORDS FOR CHAPTERS 9 THROUGH 11, AIN'T IT?!?  Ceramics - My god, the upperclassmen I sit next to are so......so.....imaginative.  Oh yes.  That's what it is.  Oh my facking GOD.  Algebra 2 H - My god.  I have a B.  *snifflesobcrydierevive*  Drama - What fun.  Gots to write a review.  World History H - It's actually OK, I've got like one of the highest grade in the class.  Wow, they must be stupid.  Actually, it ain't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  It's actually not the boringest class I have.  *surprise*  Golf/Basketball - The only good thing about this is that I get off early on Fridays.  Yay!
