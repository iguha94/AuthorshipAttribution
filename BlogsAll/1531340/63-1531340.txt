Jessica's making me blog, so I'm going to.  I'm not in the greatest mood in the world, so... just.. be warned, okay?   Mood:  Bitchy.  One word: PMS  Music:  "Tiny Little Song" by Takehito Koyasu  Random Thought:  Jessica just hung up on me.  Oy.  Currently:  Nuiuuuuuuuu  Currently @:  Home.  Bishounen I've Managed to Steal From Vanessa:   Ran, Kakyou, Yue, Kyou, Yuki, Hatsuharu, Shigure, the rest of the Furuba boys.. XD...  Today was crappy.  It was.  And I have ten Internet Explorer windows open.  Oy.  O_o;;;  I've been reading people's blogs and have concluded that their lives are worse than mine.  I should be happy.  [blink]  Optimistic?  Me?    Been obsessing way too much over Gl&uuml;hen Ran, it's not  healthy .  But it's not my fault.  That boy (man?  assassin? piece of plastic?)  is so gorgeous.  So.  Very.  Gorgeous.  [ droooooool ] He's.  So.  Pretty.  Oh.  My.  God.  [drooooooooooooool] [faints]  Bishounen.. bishounen.. bishounennnnnnn...  Meh.  Weiss Kreuz isn't good for anything but eye candy.  [licks lips]  Yummy.  I swear the thing was animated with crayons, though.  Never watch Disney before Weiss Kreuz.  It is  death  to the eyes.    Anyway, Animeniacs stocked up on wallscrolls.    And somehow, they've ran out of  Saiyuki  ones.  And that was a really bad picture, too.  Hakkai's face is off center.  And Sanzo's is too, but his face is always off center, so it's not like it's anything new.  Goku is, as always, adorable.  I don't know about Gojyo, because I can't  see  Gojyo.  All I see is pink hair.    I should stop bitching about wall scrolls.  Badminton today.  It was awesome.  Except.. CHARMAINE CAN'T SERVE.  Nuuuu.   Geometry  - Boringness!  Rasch caught me 'cheating' on the Quick Quiz.  Okay.  I wasn't cheating.  I just had the freaking handout she passed out DURING THE QUIZ on my desk.  Little bitch.  Everyone else had theirs out too.  Biiiiitch.  But she didn't do anything because the AP was there.  MWAHAHHA.   English:   More boringness.  Research on Persephone, Miss I-Picked-Flowers-I-Got-Raped.  Stop bitching, you little bastard, you're the queen of the Underworld.  Now deal, sucker.   History:  Penland    FOP:   [bitchbitch]  I can't get that damned program to work.  Who  cares  about how much they weigh on Jupiter, anyway?   I  don't, because I don't want to get pulled into their.. thingy with their.. gravitational pull... .. I learned NOTHING in eighth grade science.   PE:  Badminton.  And running.  Badminton.  Running.  Pushups.  Badminton.  Running.  Pushups...   Latin:  T__________________T  Did I ever tell you how much I HATE the dative case?  One more person ends a word in -ibus... [watches as Hannah ends a word in -ibus]   Bio:   Moo.  Substitute.  How exciting.  People are really slow.  I'm getting a B- in this class and I finished the worksheet first.  Not bragging or anything, of course...  -_________-"  Not much to brag about anyway.
