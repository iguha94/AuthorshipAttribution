Oh holy shiiiiiiiit.  Top my day.  Do it.  Do it!  Do it!  ... That sounded weird.  Well, my day sucked and I don't really wanna talk about it, but Platypus is making me.  So, without further ado,  on with da show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   {cough}   Period 0 // Honors Geometry, d00d.  Boring as hell, but that was to be expected.  Guess what we're learning?  Yup!  The  volume of spheres , my god.  Somebody save me.   Period 1 // ICT  ... ... ... Somebody stole our fucking board.  Yeah.  So now me and An don't have a wiring board, which means we can't wire labs.  Yeah.  Isn't that fantastic?  I thought so too.  So I spent the period.. like.. wandering.  And unbending ICs.   Period 2 // History  Yum, movie quiz.   Gandhi  movie quiz.  I'd have aced it, but I spent most of the movie sleeping.  Which means I didn't ace it.  But that's okay.  :(   Period 3 // Biology  I... forgot what we did.  Oh yeh.  Standards.  We looked over them in our lab groups.  Was boring as hell, but then me and Jazzy started talking about Anime Expo and cosplaying stuff.  And how pathetic my review of Weiss Kreuz was.  Er... Then we looked at bugs in her bug book.  [nodnod]   Period 4 // PE  HOLYFUCKINGSHITHOTASHELLOUTSITEDANGIT.  Very nearly got sunstroke and died.  >>;  Purposely struck out so I wouldn't have to run.  [cough]  They were bad pitches, anyway.  Never got near two feet to the bat.  Then slumped back to the locker room.  Talked to Shannon.   Period 5 // Latin  {snooze}  I wowed the class with my knowledge of the word "apparatus."  Woohoo!  -_-"  Oh, god damn it, honestly.  I refuse to believe that in a class of freshmen, sophomores, and juniors, the tiniest  freshman  was the only one who realized that apparatus was a derivative from  paratus .  Gimmeabreakman.   Period 6 // English  Yum, poems.  [eats them]  Had to explicate a love poem.  Ohboyohboy.  -.-;
