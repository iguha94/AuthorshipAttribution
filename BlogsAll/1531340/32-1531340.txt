Fun Fun Fun.  Period 0 - Biology H:  Yay.  Stupid Adams made us watch a stupid video that's got to be at least 50,000 years old on HOW TO USE A COMPOUND MICROSCOPE.  My God.  I have th ehightest grade in the class!  YES!  NO MORE CHICKEN BRAGGING, AND I BEAT THAT INSANE IDIOT WHO THINKS HE'S SMARTER THAN EVERY OTHER DAMNED PERSON WHO EXISTS!  Oh happy day.  Oh shit, I just remembered.  We have a test tomorrow.  Poo.  Watch my 94.6% drop down to a 4.6%.  Period 1 - English 1 H:  Yay, we finally got our new teacher.  He's like in his freakin 60's, and Mrs. Cook told us that he was young, somewhere in his mid-30's.  I was like, "Maybe that's young to you, but he's got twin sons who are 23!  My God.  That says a lot about how old you are..."  Oh yes, I have the highest grade in this class as well.  Yes!  And Idiot's in this class, too!  The Glory!  Period 2 - Ceramics:  Ugh....I don't even know what I have in this class until tomorrow.......  Period 3 - Algebra 2 H:  Dammit.  This is the only class I don't have an A in, and therefore it is the only academic class in which I do not possess the highest grade.  Crap.  Period 4 - Introduction to Drama:  This was cool!  I actually have an A.    Period 5 - World History H:  An A!  The highest grade in the class!  Which means, obviously, I have once again thwarted that idiot's ideas!  Power to the Platypus.  Period 6 - Golf match:  Today was just a good day overall.  I actually got a respectable score....
