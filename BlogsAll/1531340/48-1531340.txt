People suck.   Mood:  Beyond pissed  Music:  "Change the World" by V6  Random Thought:  People really suck.  Currently:  Plotting how to piss off my parents without losing rights to the computer   High:  I have my Gl&uuml;hen DVDs back!  Weeeeee!    Low:  My mom is... ANNOYING, to say the very, very least.   Period 0 - Geometry H  Haha.  Rasch caught me doing homework.  Oy.  She got mad.  Oh well.  I'll just do homework at home for once today and go back to my usual schedule on Thursday.   Period 1 - English 1 H  Class was stupid.  God, Caitlin is the slowest typistperson on the planet.  I swear, I can type this entire blog entry in the same time it takes her to type three freaking sentences.  I am so serious.  Oy.  And explaining computers to people never, ever works.  Louden is such an idiot.  He saved a picture in the "My Documents" folder and refused to listen to me when I said it was inside "Documents and Settings."  Dumbass.  If he had bothered to open that damned folder the 'My Documents' folder would be in it.   Key word here being DOCUMENTS, people.   Period 2 - NWC  God, does Farr EVER stop talking?   Break  Oh, fun.  Went out of NWC only to be followed by Caitlin.  I was talking to Dionne, and Caitlin kept... tailing me.  Oy.  So we ditched her outside and went back in, and to shorten everything, there were three minutes left for us to study FOP before class started.  Fun.   Period 3 - FOP  The test was easy.  Pah.   Period 4 - PE  More football.  We lost again.  XD   Lunch @ Key Club  [yawns]   Period 5 - Latin  Doom.  Test today.   Period 6 - Biology H  I PASSED THE TEST!  XDDDDDDDDDDDDD I got an AAAAA.  XDDDDDDDDDD
