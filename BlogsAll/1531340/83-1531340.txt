I actually wrote this yesterday....so just pretend I posted this yesterday, too.  XDDD  HOLY SMACKEREL!!!  Today was SOOOOO AWESOME!  Hahaha.  Too bad I have a whole crapload of homework I should have started a LONG time ago.  Woot!  I'm DONE!  Ok.  So.  About this weekend.  Saturday: Started out okay....I even got outta TAing for thost ickle brats because there were only TWO kids there, and the teacher was too cheap to have me TA that extra hour.  FINE.  Haha.  Went home and chilled for a while *translation: slept* until I realized it was time for practice.  Crappit I was SOO not ready.  Hahaha.  Then my mom told me we needed to leave RIGHT THEN.  That's why my hair was all f***ed up.  Whatever.  Practice was okay....save for the couple thousand times we ended up running lines for not making layups.  Haha.  We did plays most of the time.  Blah blah blah.  Hahaha then we left and we ALL went to Laura's house to make CUPCAKES for Stacey.  It was Stacey's birthday today.  Took us FOREVER.  We must've cost Mrs. Higashi about $300 in that Resolve stain remover thing.  *coughNemocough*  Anyhow.  We went through Finding Nemo.  OMG Michelle is SUCH A DORK!  Hahahah.  We were playing the "Thing" game.  She sucks at it!  She got it today, though.  I bet she went home and practiced all night.  Haha.  Got home and slept at 10!!!!  Woot!  Sunday: Was up at 7.....I dunno why.  I'm stupid like that.  Mulled around and did NOTHING for the first 5 hours of today.  Then Jody calls and says she needs a RIDE.  I mean, talk about short notice.  Hahahaha.  So Michelle's already there when we get there.  Trish can right after we got there.  We went to stretch and put on shoes, blah blah blah.  I SWEAR THAT OCBC PLAYS FOOTBALL!  Nobody listened to me.  But it's okay.  I know I'm right.  *grin*  The game wasn't bad, considering it was the first game and we'd only had two frikkin' practices.  Anyhow.  We were down 4-0 until about 10 minutes in.  Hahaha.  Pathetic, I know.  I don't even know what the halftime score was.  Anyhow, I just know we went on a crazy run right after halftime.  Our lead was 7 at one point.  DAMMIT WE LET IT GET AWAY.  *sniffle*  Couple of bad plays down the stretch, partly at the expense of yours truly.  Final score: VFW(them) 20 - SOC(us) 19.  CRAPPIT.  Aiyah.  But it's okay.  They shouldn't have won, but whatever.  We'll get 'em next time.  They beat us by 30 points last time and they were LAUGHING at us, but we shut 'em up good today.  But the real excitement was AFTER the game.  XDDD  Mrs. Higashi ended up getting a card and flowers, so we had to get everyone to sign the card and stuffs.  Then I tilted the flowers.  NOBODY TOLD ME THERE WAS WATER IN THERE!  Shiite.  But I righted it, just as I always do.  Haha.  We half-sang "Happy Birthday" to Stacey....it was kinda sad.  But Salena gave her the card and I gave her the flowers.  I shudda shoved them in her face *roar*.  Hahah.  We offered the cupcakes to her and she was all suspicious.  SHE DON'T TRUST US!  Hahaha.  We asked Connie whether or not Stacey would be okay with getting caked.....she said probably.  But she ditched us for work.  Anyhow.  We weren't really going to cake Stacey, but she came up behind Nemo and caked NEMO.  Well now, you can't expect us just to sit there and not do anything, can you?  We all chased after her.  LOL I think she needs to start conditioning with us.  We all outran her.  She was in flip-flops, but who cares?  Haha.  We got her SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD.  Hahaha.  She only got about half of us.  Strength in numbers.  It works.  Hahaha.  So then we come back to where our stuff is, and Salena takes the big bucket of ice water and dumps it ALL OVER Stacey.  It was awesome.  I got her two more times, AND I put ice down her back.  DAMMIT NOBODY REMEMBERED TO BRING WHIPPED CREAM.  Oh well.  She got me real good, though.  I had to wash my jersey.  Hahaha.  Yeah.  Had to do it before my mom got home.  My dad didn't even notice.  Yup yup.   Well then.  That was my lovely day.  Or rather, my lovely weekend.  Now that it's overwith....we're starting to think about what's going to happen NEXT WEEK AT PRACTICE *dies*.  Whatever.    Happy Birthday, Stacey!!!!     See? We got you a gift!  Wahahah.  *runs*
