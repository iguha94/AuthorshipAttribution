Well well well.....today was rather interesting, to say the least.    Period 0 -- Biology H:  Yay.  We got to look at the lovely bacteria that grew outta Mr. Adams' ear.  You have NO IDEA how badly I wanted to barf.  Blech.  Period 1 -- English 1H:  Quite interesting quiz.  Rather....unprovocative, save for the dispute about number 19, I believe it was.  Watching the movie tomorrow.  WOOT!    Period 2 -- Ceramics:  The only reason I haven't dropped this class is because QQ will kill me if I do.  Period 3 -- Algebra 2H:  We had a sub.  And poo for me, I knew the sub through basketball.  Oh yeah, we also bought our HOUSE from her.  Oiiii.  So we're sitting there doing all this stupid radical shit and she's just like, "So Jessica, what'd you get for number 3?"  POOOOOOOOPERS.  She took a seating chart and picked one person from each row.  So she's reading off names and then she gets to my row and is just like, "Jess, what's the answer?"  Shampooper-scoopers.  Period 4 -- Drama:  What fun.  We played "Hilarium."  It's quite fun.  We got killed.  *sniffle*  Period 5 -- World History H:  We spent the entire period supposedly creating our lovely artist responses.  It was fun.  JIMMY!  TALK TO ME!  After school: It was pouring.  Me, Stef, and Jody couldn't possibly walk home.  So we stayed out in the rain until 3:30.  My hands were dead.  I was about to die of hypothermia.  Mrs. Shiroma is my savior!  LOL.  You shudda seen our hands.  They were so red.............whatever.  I'm warm now....*grin*
