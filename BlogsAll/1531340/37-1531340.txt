HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Platypus! xDDDDDDDD   Click   here  to see your stupid birthday present! XD  I had to, I'm sorry.  And now, for SCHOOL!  Yay.  I hate school.   Period 0 - Geometry H:  I love this class.  I finished my geometry, English,  and  programming homework before the bell rang.  I was so damned proud of my self, you have no idea.   Period 1 - English 1 Honors:  BITE ME.  I got stuck with Caitlin again and now I have to write five S.O.S.'s for Candy from  Of Mice and Men .  Well, at least Kristy knows what  Neon Genesis Evangelion  is.  She knows what  X  is too.  Weeeeeee!!!  Bah.   Period 2 - NonWestern Cultures IB:   'Twas gay. We're learning about religions right now, and it was hard to keep from shouting out that God was a bunch of bullshit when there were rabid Christians and Jews all over the classroom.  Ah well.  We learned about Kosher pickles.   Period 3 - Programming:   Fun fun fun.  I didn't get to finish my apstring program because I only figured how to do it two minutes before the bell rang.  >.   Period 4 - PE:   We ran.   Lunch - Anime Club:   Oh my god.  We had a choice of what to watch :  Fushigi Yuugi ,  .hack//SIGN , or  Pretty Sammy  something.  CanNOT believe we ended up watching said anime with weird name.  Pretty Sammy Magical Girl.  Somefink like that.  Anyhow, they ALL sounded like Tot.  It was Tot-voice-land, I swear.  I wanted to smash the TV.  So I decided to calm myself by listening to  Weiss Kreuz  music.  Yaaay.  And the guy said they have  Weiss Kreuz Kapitel  in the library!  *squeals*  I WANTTTT...   Period 5 - Latin:   We gotted our quizzies back.  I had a 96.  x_X That's the worst I've done all year!  STUPID TRUE/FALSE QUESTIONS!  And "contendit" means HURRY, not RUN.  They could be POWER WALKING, you know!!!   Period 6 - Biology:   Holy crap.  We took notes the ENTIRE period.  Test tomorrow.  Guess who's gonna fail.  SCHOOL SUCKS.   HAPPY BIRTHDAY, PLATYPUS!
