OMFK.  We're screwed.  Dead.  DIED.  BLOWED UP.  KA-BOOMIE!  KA-BOOSH!  We played L.A. yesterday.  Gotted blown out.  But you know what was WORSE?  The fact that....um.....Stacey and Daphne were kind of there.....yeah.  That kinda sucked shit right there.  Stace got there during pre-game warm-ups.  Oiiii.  All of a sudden Nakatani comes up and is like, "Hey, Jessica, guess who's HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERE!"  In a damned sing-song voice.  So then, stupid me, I bit.  So did Laura.  Then we sawed Stacey, and we zoinked.  My Kuriboh.  AND we were making shots before we saw here.  Startin' right after that, not a SINGLE SHOT went in.  EVER.  That whole day.  No shot went in.  :(  That's bad.  Uh oh.  Then DAPHNE camed.  *ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!*  But she was LATE!  She should RUN.  She BAD.  Bad bad bad bad.  Anyhow.  We lost.  Yup.  And....um....I shot from about 30 feet out.  IT ACTUALLY HAD A CHANCE!  IT DID!  Oh my Kuriboh.  We ran one of our plays, "Blink," and I drove through the lane and got a wide-open lay-up.  'Member what I said about not making a single shot?  Yeah.  Guess what happened.  Yeah.  Missed.  I swear there was NO ONE around me for about 3 miles.  Oh yeah.  Laura had three turnovers in about 15 seconds.  o.O.  Something something.  So basically, we finished our team meeting and so me and Laura went out to get our stuff, which, unfortunately, was right under the coaches.  Damn.  AND they saw us.  Motioned for us to go sit with them.  Yeah.  Laura and me hid under the bleachers.  But they got us anyhow.  During halftime of the varsity game.  Oiiii.  Me and Laura got chewed out pretty bad.  Haha.  Christina was smart and ran away with her mommy.  Salena was smart and sat on the stands opposite our side.  But not.  Laura and I were stupid.  XDDD  Yeah.  Varsity lost.  Then we went to watch the Mesa-Cedarlane game.  MESA WON!  Stupid Daphne.....she was on the wrong side!!!!!  BAD BAD BAD.  Michelle messed up pretty bad, too.  But she did the best outta everyone!  Oiiii.  Lovely "double suicides" are in store.  We're SCREWED.  DEAD DEAD DEAD.  OMK AND Daphne took me and Jody home.  So then she drops Jody off first and then she started going on about how much we're going to run and shit.  *sniff*  She didn't wanna crash the car and injure Jody and me.  I am at a loss to understand why not.  Apparently, she didn't want us to get hurt and have Stacey blame it on her.  Poop.  We're screwed.  In tears just WRITING this stupid thing.
