Um.. yes...  well Platypus made me post here and so I think I'm back to blogger *fake happiness* But I  liked  Diaryland... BAH!  You know what?  I'll post in BOTH!  Yesh... >>;;;  Okay, that was odd.  Oddness!   I love odd.  Ooh!  Have you ever seen baby Priest Seto?  He's incredibly adorable.  He's all chubby, short, and cute, and so unlike what he grows up to be (which would be skinny, tall, and  hot ).  By the way, I'm not a fangirl.  Umm... let's see... attack Platypus.  Why does  she  get fast Internet access?  I'm stuck with cable, which normally would be decent.  On the contrary, it's not.  You want to know why?  Because the company is  Adelphia .  Yes, Adelphia.  The same company who told me to log onto their website and download a support package WHEN THE CABLE MODEM WAS NOT WORKING.    Right.  So, anyhow, I'm working on the first layout (I say it's the first, but it's actually the fifth) of my YuGiOh site, and it's only taking a very long time because I'm writing episode summaries.  Have you any idea how long those take? Lovely.   I want.. a shrubbery!  Damn those Monty Python fans...   RANDOM THOUGHT:  If Arnold Schwarzenegger wins for governor, I hope they misspell his name in the records.
