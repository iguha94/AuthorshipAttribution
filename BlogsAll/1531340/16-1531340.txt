Platypus is such a hypocrite.  -_- Telling ME to blog when SHE doesn't do it herself.  Puuuuuh- leeze ...  Well, I at least have somewhere to rant about today.  If you're not in a mood to listen to me talk, I suggest you back away.  First, let me introduce myself.  I'm a freshman.  An itty-bitty freshman.  I'm not telling you where I'm from, though, sorry.  I manage a website (  here ) and I love HTML, CSS, JS, and all that good stuff.    Period 0 - Can geometry be any more boring?  For Chrissake, I learned all this crap when I was four and a half feet tall!  Wait.. I  am  four and a half feet tall... -_- Okay, four feet tall, then.  In any case, I learned it a while ago.  And I don't give SHIT about proofs.  Plus, my teacher is so boring it's not even funny.  They should get lively and animated teachers to teach in 0 period.  They  do  realize NOBODY is awake at that time, don't they..?   Period 1 - It was okay.  An etymologies quiz that I totally bombed, but apart from that and the fact that the moron sitting across the row from me keeps cutting himself to scare me, it was fine.  Oh yes.  Loads of homework though.   Period 2 - Holy crap I hate this class.  The teacher is a ditz, the people around me are morons, the subject is boring (who CARES about Africa?), and this so-called "IB" class is full of complete idiots.  All we did was freaking take notes.     Period 3 - GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.  C++ is fun, but the teacher can GO TO HELL.  So can that guy sitting next to me.  Get your own brain, moron.  And learn to turn on a calculator; it's something I've personally known how to do since I was... really small.   Period 4 - I HATE PE.  HATE IT.  HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE IT.  HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE it.  I don't WANT to run like a leprechaun!  For chrissake, I'M NOT IRISH!   Period 5 - Latin!  I hate Caecilius.. *kills him*  I think I failed the quiz... -_______________-   Period 6 - BBBIIIOOO.... *kills*
