Damn my dad PISSING ME OFF....again.  Shit.   So anyhow, had a pretty interesting day.  I shall now type.  Unless, of course, the hubby comes in and wants the f*cking computer.  *roar*  Period 0 -- Biology H: We spent the first 20 minutes or so working on the labs that we have due....ALL at the SAME time. Stupid Adams. I have just concluded that all FAT men are STUPID and lack COMMON SENSE. Freaks. Anyhow. Then he spent the second half of the class lecturing. Have I mentioned how STUPID his VOICE is? Well, it's CRAPPY. Anyhow. Stupid class. Test tomorrow. Going to FAIL.   Break -- Media Center: Went to the Media Center to work out our POW. Stupid thing. At first, we tried finding the volume of half the sphere and then subtracting that from the volume of the cone. Logically, that would have given us the answer. But NO. Stupid thing came out NEGATIVE. How the HELL does it come out negative? We checked it over twice. Then we use the Pythagorean Thereom and we THINK we have it until the idea is shot down AGAIN on some dumbass technicality. Anyhow. After an hour and half, we finally realized that our FIRST answer was right and that we just wasted 1.5 hours FREAKING DEBATING. BULLSHIT. Anyhow. Oh yes. I dissed Wimer about her height....she SLAPPED me. o.O   Period 1 -- English 1H: Lalala...talked about the mystery story. Dahlberg read us something from his memoirs book that he gave to his dad. Interesting, for lack of a better word. Lovely. Can't wait to read Joseph's KKK story.....oiiiii.  Period 2 -- Ceramics: Video bulletin. Ima FAIL this class, I am.   Period 3 -- Algebra 2H: We went through the notes....took us the whole damn period. Whoever wanted to know about composite functions ANYHOW? Damn shit. THEN she tells us that we have until THURSDAY to do the POW. HOLY @#$(#*&#%$&#%. I was MAD. Anyhow.   Period 4 -- Drama: Real fun. Gina stole Rose from us! Rose was OUR partner. Fine. So me and Squirt worked on the scene by OURSELVES. We don't NEED Rose. Hahaha.   Period 5 -- World History H: Took the "Night" test. That test was HARD. It took me 4 hours to write a damn notecard, and I STILL failed. Poopers.   Period 6 -- Basketball: We met up with Ed, convinced him not the have conditioning this week because of the RAIN. We are TOO good. Then we went and dropped off our bags. Laura the munch....Jody turned it in for her. We still have to check in.   After School: I wanted the go through the nursery....but it wasn't OPEN. So then we had to go and walk the LONG way. For those of you who have no life and happen to know the streets, we walked along Wedgeworth, turned on Flamstead, walked ALL THE WAY down Sigman, up Stimson, and ALL TE WAY up Halliburton. By the time we got to Stef's house, school was out for the other people. They probably beat us home. We're trying NEW methods! I messed with Stef's piano. I CAN STILL SIGHT-READ! Boo-yah. Awwww.....now Stef's determined to beat me. XDDD   Homework: ~ Study for Biology test  ~ Algebra II  ~ Character Biography  ~ Artistic Response   BLAH.  ~ Platypus.
