DAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMIT.  Period 0 - Biology H: Damn bug test.  I swear I failed.  I spent about 5 hours studying for that damned test.  Then I fell asleep, completely omitting the pictoral section of the study guide.  I failed.  Blah.  Period 1 - English 1 H:  I LOVE this class.  Shit, it's probably one of my favorite classes.  DAMN.  This class is really really fun.  The teacher thinks I'm a genius just because I happened to answer everything on the pop quiz correctly, including the one about, "What is the name of the woman Homer had to deliver his first telegram to?"  Her name was mentioned ONCE, and I surprised him....I gave him her entire name.  Mrs. Rosa Esperanza Sandoval.  So yes.  I LOVE this class.  Period 2 - Ceramics:  Whoo-hoo!  I finished all my shit in time.  Dammit.  Now I have to glaze all 4 projets in one day. Bullshit.  Period 3 - ALgebra 2 H:  Damned POW.  Not going to get it.  Period 4 - Drama:  Fun.  We were supposed to be rehearsing, but nobody was.  period 5 - World History H:  Went up and got Nectar in a Seive.  Fun.  Afterschool:  Ditched....no bball practice.  We went to ask Greg for Stacey's pictures, and he's all like, "Oh shit.  I swear, guys, I'll bring it tomorrow."  This was a junior's conversation with a group of 3 lil female freshmen.  He's so funny.  He's like 6 foot some, and Laura's like 3 foot some.  There he was, telling us he'd bring it tomorrow.  It's so fun to pick on him.  I was making fun of his shot during practice....I had to run, but just because Stacey thought I was paying more attention to his shot than my own, which, conviently, was dead that day.  She made me run a set of double lines.  I seriously think she was kidding, but I did 'em anyways.
