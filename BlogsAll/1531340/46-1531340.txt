Today wasn't that bad.  Oy.   Mood:  Happy  Music:  "The Real Folk Blues" by Kanno Yoko  Random Thought:  Black is good.  Currently:  Eating pistachios XD   High:  I wore black.. ALL DAY.  ^_______^;;; CTYness!  Low:  I forgot my Latin homework.  ;_;  And Barney's here.   Period 0 - Geometry H  I did my homework last night, so there.  XD  Class was boring as usual, the highlight being the bell at 7:57.   Period 1 - English 1 H  Eekp.  We did character presentations today, and I know I failed.  >.   Period 2 - NWC  She made a new seating arragement thingeh for the Russian thingeh!  XD  I somehow ditched Caitlin (Sorry, BUB.)  and am now sitting with Rachel, Krupa, and Emily.  Victory.     Break  Ran out of NWC and to the band room with Kathy.  Bandos are STUPID.  Oy.   Period 3 - FOP  Online test!  XD  I finished and then I was bored, so I made a list of my favorite seiyuu and their most major/cool voice roles on Notepad.  That is, after I typed out the lyrics to Velvet Underworld without looking at my binder.  >. Gravitation  section.  Eep.   Period 4 - PE  Football!  XD  Homer tried to kick the ball but he didn't make the field goal.  MWAHAHAHA.  -_-"   Anime Club  FLCL!  Caitlin says it's plotless.  FLCL is  not  plotless!  You want plotless?  Watch  Pokemon !     Period 5 - Latin I  @____________________@  'Nuff said.  Got a 50/50 on the test.  Crap.  I could've got a 51/50, but NOOOOOOO... WHY does Pompeiiani have to be second declension and WHY did I forget?!   Period 6 - Biology H  Played Tetris on my calculator instead of listening.  Highscore - 27,514.  Not bad, considering I haven't played in centuries.  Now watch as Jessica comes to ridicule me with her 50,000+ high score...   Afterschool  I'm hoooooooooooooome.  XD
