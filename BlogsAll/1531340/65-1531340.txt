Hn.  I'm reading X fanfiction.  Again.  Eh.  Stupid people making Sorata gay. On with the show.     Period 0 - Geometry  Aw, bloody hell.  This class is *still* nothing.  Meh, Jessica.  I want your Algebra II class.  [pouts]  Then again, if all your problems are as bitchy as the one you showed me.. maybe not.  Hm.  Is the kid sitting diagonally from me in this class male or female?  I can't tell.   Period 1 - Digital Electronics  I have.. a LAB PARTNER.  [ominous music plays]  Though An is perfectly fine, I'd really rather have Ran.  [evil snicker]  Then I'd kidnap him and ... yeah.  :P  But, he's not REAL, so I guess I'll just sit here and wallow in self-pity.  Oh, WHY can't they be real?  [tears hair out]  We got our spiffy books today.  Spif-fy.  I sit in the far corner of the class.  It figures.  What is  with  teachers and alphabetical order?  Pshaw.   Period 2 - Geography/Nonwestern Cultures IB  Ah well, back to the monotony.  We spent the *entire* class listening to Ms. Farr talk.  Whoop-de-freaking-doo.   Period 3 - Biology  We took a TEST.  Yes, boysies and girlsies, a  BIOLOGY TEST .  On the SECOND DAY of the semester.  Dude, it was harder than the final.  >.>;   Period 4 - PE  TRACK SEASON!  Ima gonna DIE.  We're going to do long jumps, and we were practicing, and I smartmouthed this guy for telling me to jump farther.  Yeah.   Period 5 - Latin  [snooze]  Constitutum Caesarium.. something.  I know I spelled the second one incorrectly but my Latin binder is downstairs and I'm far too lazy to go down and get it.  So, yeah.  Worked with Jessie on Caecilius' death story and listened to Ryan bitch about Ms. Kline.   Period 6 - English  T______________________________________T  Yes, there was a reason I had a vaguely suicidal expression on my face in this class.  No, I am not telling you why.
