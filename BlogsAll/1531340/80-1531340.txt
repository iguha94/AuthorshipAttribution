And no, I have not been here in a while.  So sue me, bitch.     Monday -->  PERIOD 0 // See ruler.  See ruler snap in half. PERIOD 1 // So, 110110001010010101001010 in base 10 is? PERIOD 2 // Cue the tissue box stampede. PERIOD 3 // Yay, we're starting the BUG PROJECT!  Isn't that AWESOME?  We're gonna kill BUGSIES!

Isn't this *exciting*?  PERIOD 5 // ... Fuck. PERIOD 6 // I doubt Golding actually MEANT for us to find so much fucking symbolism in the Lord of the Flies.  It's a goddamned motherfucking book for Christ's sake.  Throwing off your school uniform and jumping stark naked into the water does  NOT  symbolize your rejection of society's structure!

Swathi (the normal person), me (the pretending-to-be-ditzy person), and Richard (the guy who just wants to read Lord of the Flies upside down).  I think we got to the.. second question?  Out of fifteen-ish?     PERIOD ZERO // HONORS GEOMETRY \\ RASCH   {beepcensored}  She gave me a fucking check minus on one of the homework assignments JUST because I showed work a weensy bit differently.  Prat.  She hates me.  I'll betcha  anything  she spends forever checking my paper alone and gives everyone else full credit.

Which I promptly fell asleep after.    PERIOD TWO // HISTORY \\ FARR  MORE notes.  This is going to become a recurring theme, I can tell.  But today's notes were incredibly interesting.

With the corniest animation and graphics on the planet.  Okay, first, everyone goes on a TIME MACHINE.
