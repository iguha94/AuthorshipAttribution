I'm blogging two days in a row.  That's awesome.  I never do that now.  [ T_T ] I know, I know.  I've become neglecting and evil.  Sorry.   Mood:  Meh.  Music:  "Velvet Underworld" by Weiss Kreuz  Currently:  Typing up the Rurouni Kenshin section  Currently @:  Home  Today wasn't fun.  [whines]  I hate that.  I'm still wearing my glasses because I have an eye infection.  At least I have new glasses. They're silver titanium now, wanna see?  [holds out at computer screen]  And they're pretty!  And the subscription is 800 degrees!  XDDD  I'm almost clinically blind, I know.  Richard told me only ten times this past week.  People seem to take pleasure in taking my glasses and putting them on.  I guess they like migraines?   Geometry:   Oh the boringness.  But Rasch moved me up a seat so now I'm closer to her.  [wrinkles nose]  And I'm surrounded by nastily optimistic people.  Nastily so.  They put on makeup in class and squeal about real life boys.  What's so special about those?  [snort]  Carbon-based life forms...   English:  Library time!  Why must Demeter mate with Zeus?  Why?   History:  We had the most idiotic substitute teacher of all time.  Seriously.  That man had no idea what he was saying, and he looked like a total idiot to boot.  Ass.   FOP:   We had.. NO TIME on the computer, seriously.  Not like I could've done anything, though I did peek at Tiny Tenshi [hits self] to see if it had fallen apart or something.  I do that.  I don't know why.  O.o;;  I'm really, really paranoid about that stuff.  I almost fainted, because it was 11:00, the day had already progressed for 11 hours, and TT had..  six hits .  ...  Look, I'm not even that hit obsessed, and I was scared and frightened.  I don't ever want to go affiliate hunting again; I have bad judgment.  [prods some really, really weird sites I'm affiliated with]  God, I hope nobody sees this entry.  T_______T  Though I think the webmistress in question is dead.  She hasn't updated since September.   PE:  More badminton and more proof that Charmaine cannot serve to save her life!  [I'm not mad at you, really.  -_-"  I just think you can't serve.  It's a fact, dear.]  Not like I'm any better, so maybe I shouldn't say anything... >D   Latin:  Substitute today.  God, can Kline ever get to school?  Heaven was sucking up to him.  She was like... hitting on him.  For Christ's sake, the man is at least 75.   Biology:  Something about hermaphrodites and sex-linked traits... @_@
