HOLY DIPSHIT YESTERDAY WAS FUNNY ASS!  OK.  But Wednesday and my whole weekend first.  Wednesday:  Well, condensed, took a damn bio test, took a Unit 4 English test, took a Chapter 4-2 test, and practice.  Fun.  Thursday:  Whoo-hoo.  Fun.  Slept until about 10:00 A.M.  Dad's friends came over around 4:30.  Big ass Thanksgiving dinner.  20-pound turkey.  Hell yeah.  Bunch of gravy.  Baked potato.  Potato salad.  Stuffs like that.  Friday:  Didn't do squat...went to Odie's house to make posters and shit for the alumni game....but dind't do shit squat.  Saturday:  Practice, ALUMNI GAME!  Whoo-hoo!  Damn, there were a lot of people there.  Man, I took a big hit, and my coaches were all there.  It was funny!  Haha.  Anyways.  Alumni game.  Last second of the half, Daphne throws up a half-court shot.  It goes in.  The whole SOC goes crazy ass.  FUNNY!  Last 5 seconds of the 4th quarter.  Tied at 55 each.  Alumni force a turnover at the other end.  Stacey's under the basket.  Nobody around for 50,000 miles.  Left side of the basket.  Right-handed shot.  I was like, "OK, shit, it's over!"  It's out.  I'm on the floor.  We sat in the first row.  I'm ON THE FLOOR.  LAUGHING MY ASS OFF.  FUNNY ASS.  Stacey's embarrassed as all hell.  Daphne's on the floor, slapping it.  I'm dying of laughter.  Daphne, Connie, and Trisha get Stacey and point over to where the team is sitting and where I'm rolling on the floor.  You should've seen Stacey's face.  It was like, "Oh, shit, I forgot Jessica and my whole group of kids are here."  She did that thing where she just shakes her head and is like, "Oh, shit."  It was funny.  She comes over.  I'm still on the floor laughing my ass off.  Man, I'm rolling around.  FUNNY.  What does she say?  "That just goes to show -- do as I say, not as I do."  Man.  I told her, soon as I stopped laughing, that she missed THREE lay-ups, and that all her shots, all left-side lay-ups, were taken with her right hand.  AND SHE MISSED THREE OF THEM.  oOo....the three other coaches were like, "Jessica, you are going to be runnnnnnnnnnnning....."  MAN!  FUNNY-ASS!  SHIT.  THAT WAS PROBABLY THE FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER, EVER WITNESSED.  LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We need to replay that.  HELL.  FUCKING.  I want to watch it again.  Sunday:  Bio homework for 2.5 hours, lunch, english paper, math, world history, still not done.  Lakers game.
