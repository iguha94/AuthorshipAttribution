               I implore you to take a few minutes out of your busy day to try and wrap your mind around the following figures.  In the calendar year of 2002, AIDS took the lives of 3 million people.  That's 3 million mothers, fathers, children, brothers, sisters, cousins, aunts, uncles, friends, lovers, and partners  that are no longer with us or the ones who loved them.  Taking it a step further, over 8,000 people die from AIDS or HIV/AIDS complications every day. Perhaps even more astounding is the fact that nearly 14,000 new cases of HIV infections occured every single day last year.  The numbers are nearly incomprehensible--and yet they are fact.  Today while you go about your life, take a few minutes to reflect on these mindnumbing statistics.  Consider wearing a red ribbon today to show your support and concern for the 42 million people around the World that are living with and facing a disease with no cure.  Consider lending your time or financial support to a local or national HIV/AIDS organization or charity.  Take time out of your day to make a small gesture in your workplace or home to educate people about HIV/AIDS.  Fight HIV/AIDS discrimination. Whatever you do, just do something.  To that end, this day I use my weblog to offer links to important information, educational issues, facts, useful organizations, and perhaps most importantly, the human face of HIV/AIDS.
