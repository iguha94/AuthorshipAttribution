          MONDAY MUNDANE  1.  Maureen Dowd's take on Bush and the issue of homosexuality in Sunday's  New York Times  (   "Butch, Butch Bush!"  ) is pretty funny and spot on.  2.  I love the new Madonna/Missy Elliott commercial for   Gap .  Not only is the pairing of the two Divas unexpected, but the "Into The Hollywood Groove" remix (a reworking of Madonna's "Get Into The Groove" and "Hollywood" with a Missy rap) is awesome. (p.s. There's a remix of "Hollywood" on the limited edition Gap CD)  3.  I am such a fragrance slut.  New recommendations: Dolce & Gabbana "Pour Homme", Gucci "Rush" and Montblanc "Presence".  4.  I finally broke down and bought the   Yoshitomo Nara Flip Clock  that I've been coveting.  I purchased the blue one and absolutely love it.  I came across some of Nara's prints recently and have surprisingly become a fan.   His work is a combination of Pop Art and traditional Japanese comic book art called   manga .  Most of his subjects are either children or animals.  There something about his juxtaposition of innocence with evil that is quite affecting.  He has a new exhibition coming to several U.S. cities later this Fall.  5.  Francois Ozon's    "Swimming Pool"    is definitely a head trip.    Charlotte Rampling  gives a tour de force performance in her role as Sarah Morton.
