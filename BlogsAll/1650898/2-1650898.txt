          MISCELLANEA VOL. I, NO. 1  1.  I am totally bouncing on the new jam from Danish duo   JUNIOR | SENIOR  called "Move Your Feet".  Their U.S. debut album " D-D-Don't Stop The Beat " drops on August 5 on Atlantic Records.  Already a European hit, their video clip has hit MTV2.  The duo in itself is a bunch of contradictions: one gay, one straight; one tall, one short, etc.  It's hard to put a genre label on their music--it's all over the place--and great.  I dare you to listen to it and not move.  2.  DVDs recently purchased: " The Pianist ", " The Hours ", " Beautiful Thing ", " Oxygen ", " Hairspray ", " How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days " and " The Bourne Identity ".  3.  Glad to see    Coldplay's " The Scientist " clip get some recognition from   MTV's 2003 VMAs .  Up for three moon men (Best Group Video, Breakthrough Video, and Best Direction), the re-wind clip by Director Jamie Thraves is brilliant.  4.  Cadbury "Flakes" and "Snowflakes" are chocolate lover's heroin.  Only one problem, they're only sold in the U.K. (rumor has it, a favorite of the Queen).  Thank goodness for import stores.  5.  Did anyone see   Ryan Seacrest's  piece on "The X-Games Experience" on Jay Leno Friday night?  Do we  really  have to ask after that performance?  6.  It amazes me that months after a relationship has ended, there are days that are blue.  Days that are filled with memories that seep into every minute of an hour.  Maybe the head moves on, but the heart always seems to reserve a small place for the people you have loved.  It's a beautiful agony.  Blood red torture and cool blue justification.  The canvas of what has been--but can be no more.  You shouldn't look...but you can't help it.  It's been one of "those" days.  Not really sad....maybe melancholy?  Sometimes, I really do miss you.
