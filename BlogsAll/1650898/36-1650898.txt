          THE SCIENCE OF BEING GAY  There's an interesting piece in today's  New York Times  Editorials/Op-Ed section.  Entitled   "Gay at Birth?" , columnist Nicholas D. Kristof examines some of empirical data from various studies trying to ascertain a genetic level link to homosexuality.  While it refers to the infamous "blinking" study published in  Behavioral Neuroscience , there are some interesting studies cited in the piece.  Among the statistics I found intriguing:  --An identical twin of a gay person is about twice as likely to be gay as a fraternal twin would be. --Gays are 39 percent more likely to be left-handed than straight people. --A male is more likely to be gay if he has older brothers.  For each older brother a male is about 33 percent more likely to be gay. --Lesbians have finger-length ratios that are more like those of men than of women.   WHEN LIGHTNING STRIKES  With all the uproar that Mel Gibson's "The Passion Of Christ" has generated, I couldn't help but laugh at reading that Jim Caviezel, who plays Jesus, was   struck  by lightning during filming.  Now, I'm not laughing that Mr. Caviezel was hit, but about the inherent irony.  Apparently uninjured, a producer on the set said he could see smoke coming out the actor's ear.  Perhaps, Mr. Caviezel should consider rethinking his career--or at the very least calling his agent.   FURTHER TALES OF THE APOCALYPSE  Yesterday while surfing channels, I happened upon MTV's "Wade Robson Project".  (You didn't really think there'd be a video did you?)  It was apparently a rebroadcast of the finale of this dance competition whatever.  There aglitter in silver mesh and gyrating was J.C. Chasez singing "All Day I Dream About Sex" a/k/a "A.D.I.D.A.S".  There's no turning back...
