          THE GREAT SNAKE OIL TOUR  The White House is intent on shoring up support for their Iraq policy.  In recent days, speeches aimed at spotlightling the Bush Administration's "progress in Iraq" have come from  Bush, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld, and Powell.   What amounts to a glorified publicity campaign is drawing   criticism  from Democrats and Republicans alike.  Particularly infurating are Cheney's remarks in a speech given to the conservative Heritage Foundation.  Cheney once again asserted that Saddam Hussein did indeed possess weapons of mass destruction and was an eminent threat to the United States and other countries.  He also again made claims that Hussein had direct links to Al Qaeda.  Perhaps most distressing was Cheney's assertion that the United States had the right to defend itself against any perceived threat -- with or without unanimous international support.   Personally, I'm reminded of the tale of the boy who cried wolf one time too many.   DEAR EDITOR  So, did you hear the one about the heartwarming letter from a soldier in Iraq extolling the great work the U.S. is doing and how grateful the Iraqi children are?  Apparently, at least eleven U.S. newspapers   received  similar letters from different soldiers.  There is even at least one claim of a forged signature.  I'm sure no one in  our  government was responsible for this campaign *cough*.     THE FLU & YOU  I had my influenza   vaccination  yesterday.  I'm always a bit hesitant to get it, but it seems to be highly advisable in this post-SARS year.   PRODUCT OF THE WEEK    L'Occitane Hand Cream
