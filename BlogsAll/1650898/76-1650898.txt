          THE WITCHING HOUR  Last night, Pokey (my cat) and I sat with the door open waiting for the ghouls and goblins to arrive.  With a large bowl of candy at wait, we had a handful of trick or treaters visit us.  My favorite costume this year was a young girl wearing a big, poofy pink ballgown.  The hoop skirt was cool, but the very best part of her attire was the hair.  She had a pile of cotton candy pink hair that must have gone three feet in the air.  It was all very Marie Antoinette "let them eat cake".  Anyhow, I snapped this picture of Pokey as he tried to sneak up on the bowl to paw candy bars to the floor.  I swear I didn't touch his eyes.  But, I am starting to wonder if he's not possessed.        QUOTE OF THE DAY  " I have never had any difficulty with people who are gay doing things that they do in any walk of life that people who are not gay do. "-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair   BOY GEORGE DID IT!  In what can only be termed a unique strategy, the German magazine publisher Gruner + Jahr   claimed  in its suit against Rosie O'Donnell, that the problems began when Ms. O'Donnell fell under the spell of none other than Boy George.  In their breach of contract suit, G + J claim that they were appalled by some of O'Donnell's suggested topics for profile stories and cover photographs which included boxer Mike Tyson, Cher, Madonna and Boy George. (Oh! that crazy lesbian, what  was  she thinking?)  G + J further claims that Boy George allegedly urged her to shed the image of nice talk-show queen for that of a caustic comedian and high-profile lesbian.
