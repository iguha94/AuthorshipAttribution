          JERRY GARCIA & PORN    Rufus Wainwright  will release his third album, entitled "Want One", on Septemeber 23.  In Sunday's ' New York Times '  Arts & Leisure cover story (  "Rufus Wainwright Journeys to 'Gay Hell' and Back" ), Wainwright discusses his addiction to crystal meth and other substances.  A fan of both "Rufus Wainwright" and "Poses", I look forward to the new release--which will actually be released on two separate discs, "Want One" & "Want Two".  In the article, Wainright discusses his addiction to crystal meth and anonymous sex that eventually led to the caption above and a stay at Hazeldon.  He has some very interesting things to say about being gay, the nature of gay sex and his personal demons.   He conjectures that gay men are particulary susceptible to the lure of crystal meth.  He says , "Years of sexual insecurity, the low-grade discrimination you suffer, the need to belong â€” speed takes care of all that in one second."  He goes on to describe some of his personal experiences with the drug--and others.  While I'm sure there will be those who decry his speaking publically as nothing more than a publicity stunt for the new album--I would have to disagree.  I think the following passage more than illustrates his startling candor:   "For years, and I mean thousands of years, the gay man's mind has been treated as perverted, clandestine and dirty," he went on, "and speed reinforces and glamorizes that as an ideal. And with drugs, what's more dangerous is more sexually exciting. On that drug I had really horrible thoughts that turned me on. I had a few of those real gay lost weekends, where everything goes out the window, where you want to make pornos or you want to have sex with children. I mean, your mind is just completely ravaged."         FRESHMAN DIARIES  Showtime's ten part documentary/reality series, "  Freshman Diaries " begins its run tonight.  The documentary chronicles the first year of twelve students entering the University of Texas at Austin.  The opener prominently features Neil, an avowed homosexual who questions his sexuality when he realizes he's attracted to a girlfriend.  So far reviews have been very positive regarding the series, which garnered an "A-" for "Entertainment Weekly".  TV Guide cutely writes,  "...smarter than MTV's Sorority Life and scarier than the real world."  I'm such an addict that I'm sure I'll at least check out the opener.
