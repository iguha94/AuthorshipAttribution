          LOST IN TRANSLATION     WHEN HE SAYS:   I had a wonderful time last night.   WHAT HE MEANS:   Who the hell are you?    WHEN HE SAYS:   I'll give you a call.   WHAT HE MEANS:   I'd rather be dragged out into the desert, tied to a stake, covered with honey, and left over a killer ant colony than see you again.    WHEN HE SAYS:   I think we should see other people.   WHAT HE MEANS:   I'm already seing other people, so if you tramp around too, I won't feel like such a slut.    WHEN HE SAYS:   Is there something wrong?   WHAT HE MEANS:   It does get harder than this right?    WHEN HE SAYS:   Haven't I seen you somewhere before?   WHAT HE MEANS:   Nice ass.    WHEN HE SAYS:   Can I buy you a drink?   WHAT HE MEANS:   Wanna have sex?    WHEN HE SAYS:   I've been doing some thinking.   WHAT HE MEANS:   You're not as hot as when I was drunk.    WHEN HE SAYS:   I think it would be better if we were just friends.   WHAT HE MEANS:   You're ugly.    WHEN HE SAYS:   It's not you, it's me.   WHAT HE MEANS:   It's not me, it's you.    WHEN HE SAYS:   How was it for you?   WHAT HE MEANS:   You were crap.    WHEN HE SAYS:   Did you come?   WHAT HE MEANS:   ...Because I sure as hell didn't.     HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!!
