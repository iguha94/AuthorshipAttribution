          DEATH THREATS  A while back when addressing the issue of the consecration of Reverend Gene Robinson to Archbishop of New Hampshire in the Episcopal Church, I made mention that his personal safety should be a concern.  Well, it now looks like that is a forgone conclusion.  On Monday came   word  that the Reverend is now under 24-hour FBI protection.  He has also confirmed that he has received "several" death threats from  Christian fundamentalists and radicals.  He has also received volumes of hate mail, calling him among other things a "fornicating lecherous pig".  I figured that it would only be a matter of time before some religious zealot would claim that their god told them to kill Robinson because his homosexuality would corrupt their church.  So much for love thy neighbor, understanding and acceptance.  It's really saddening to see that Reverend Robinson will always have to look over his shoulder while serving his church just because he is a gay man.   CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES  Watching the pictures of flames on the ground and smoke plumes from space of the raging   wildfires  menacing California is at once fascinating and horrifying.  I've spoken to a couple of friends who are now having to get ready to evacuate their homes.  Hopefully, the expected shift in the Santa Ana Winds will allow firefighters to make more progress.
