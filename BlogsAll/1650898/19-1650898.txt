          THE LITTLE THINGS  This morning I awoke early ready to start a day filled with all those projects one puts off until the weekend.  I fixed myself a big cup of tea and put on Josh Kelley's "For The Ride Home" and sat in the overstuffed chair in front of the large picture window looking out on the unfolding day.  Holding the cup up to my face, smelling the crispness of the tea and feeling the heat graze my face.  It is in these quiet, contemplative moments that you are gently reminded of the little things.  Watching the leaves fluttering in a gentle breeze.  Watching my cat, Pokey, arch his back and they flop back down on the throw rug.  Hearing the nest of birds that live under the eaves of my roof chirp for breakfast.  Quiet.  Simplicity. The color of the sky grows more vivid as the sun starts its rise over the mountain.  I stretch.  One of those stretches that sends waves down your body and curls the ends of your toes.  I reach over and light a tubereuse candle.  Inhale deeply.  Exhale slowly.  Hearing my heartbeat mysteriously echoed in my head in the quiet morning.  Suddenly the projects don't seem that pressing.  Maybe they can wait.  Jason Mraz starts singing in the background.  The tea tastes better than usual.  The bright streamers of sunlight are hitting the porch through the open door.  The smells of the coming Autumn start wafting in as the morning heat begins to percolate.  I pull my robe a little closer fighting off the slight edge of chill on the morning breeze.  I catch myself smiling.  Here in this solitude, all of the problems and irritations of the week finally start to surrender.  There are so many things and feelings I want.  There are so many things to do and places to be.  There are problems and projects to be tackled.  But for just a couple of hours everything is nearly perfect--and satiating.  It's the little things that help fill up the soul tank when it starts running dangerously low.  Today, I am full.
