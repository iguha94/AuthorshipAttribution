          INFORMATION SOCIETY  The first World Summit on the Information Society   closed  Friday in Geneva, Switzerland.  The three-day event was organized and sponsored by the United Nations.   Delegates from 168 nations around the world met to draft a declaration of principles and 29-point action plan to address the needs of extending the ever-burgeoning electronic information society to help address the needs of underdeveloped countries and stimulate and boost economic growth.  The conference focused on implementing communication and information flow via such emerging technologies as the World Wide Web, broadcasting multimedia and cellular telephones.    It is mind-boggling to note that  approximately 90 percent of the world population is not connected to the Internet .  This staggering figure only demonstrates the width of the so-called 'digital divide' between rich and poor countries.  One proposed solution is the implementation of a "Solidarity Fund" to help developing nations pay for the implementation of technology.  Of course, this was a great bone of contention between delegates that eventually lead to no formal declaration of such a fund.  Going into the summit, some of the richer developed countries (most notably Japan and the European Nation) sent lower profile delegates as a means to protest the formation of such a fund.  Underveloped countries (most notably African delegates) lobbied strenuously for the financial assistance.  The issue was skirted--though noted to be under discussion--until the second phase conference convenes in Tunis in 2005.  You can find a lot of interesting material and background on the official   World Summit on the Information Society  website.  There are also many business and non-profit projects working toward similar goals.  An interesting example of this is   The Hello World Project .
