          U.K. DREAMING  I must have been feeling nostalgic this weekend.  For some reason, I pulled out M People's " Bizarre Fruit " and Skunk Anansie's " Stoosh ".  Both albums are some of my all-time favorites, but they failed to attract much attention here in the U.S.  Both groups are fronted by some incredibly powerhouse vocals.  M People's " Bizarre Fruit " was released in 1995  and showcases the vocal talents of   Heather Small .  Songs like "Sight For Sore Eyes" and "Search For The Hero" still sound great today.  As for Skunk Anansie, I own the three albums they recorded before they split up in 2001.  Their mix of political commentary, rock and beauty was very unique.  Their frontwoman,   Skin , has got a voice that can shatter glass in one instant and move you to tears in the next.  " Stoosh " (1997) is probably in my top ten favorite albums of all time.  With cuts like "Infidelity (Only You)", "Hedonism (Just Because You Feel Good)",  "We Love Your Apathy", "Yes It's Fucking Political" and "Glorious Pop Song", the album is a sonic adventure.  Something for the mind, heart and soul.  I'd highly recommend you check it out if you haven't.  The track "Brazen (Weep)" is worth the price of the album.  Both women have released solo projects--" Proud " for Heather Small and " Flesh Wounds " for Skin, but you can only get them via import.        CHICAGO  Watched '   Chicago  ' for the second time on DVD.  I think I enjoyed it more the second go round--and I already loved it.  It's great that they've included the Catherine Zeta-Jones/Queen Latifah duet "Class" on the DVD.  I think it should have been left in the movie, but I can see why they cut it in terms of pacing.  Rob Marshall is pure genius and Bill Condon could not have written a better screenplay if he tried.   LIKE THE VIRGINS  There's a lot of buzz in the gossip columns about a supposed luncheon between   Madonna, Britney Spears and J. Lo  over the weekend.  Word has it that something could be up between the three for the opening of next week's MTV   Vmas .  The guess is that they will all perfrom "Like A Virgin".  Stop laughing.  Wonder what happened to Missy?   THE BROKEN  If you are a fan of techtv's "Call For Help" or "The Screen Savers", you should check out the first episode of "  thebroken ".  It's a videozine by Kevin Rose and Dan Huard on the underground culture of hacking.  It's interesting and hilarious.  Their experiment in social engineering is unique to say the least.  Make sure to watch the outtakes at the end.
