          A NEW DAY IN LOUISIANA  Lt. Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco   becomes  the first woman in Louisiana to assume the top helm in a hotly-contested gubernatorial run-off election.  Blanco, who had trailed in most polls, pulled 52% of the vote to 48% by her opposition Bobby Jindal.  In a spate of recent loses for the Democratic party in the South, Blanco's win was an important one.  Though Jindal picked up the endorsement of New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin (who is a Democrat), the move apparently failed to help Jindal.  Blanco picked up the majority vote in her native Acadiana, as well as carrying New Orleans.  In recent weeks, Nagin's endorsement of Jindal had created quite a stir within the vibrant GLBT community in New Orleans.  Shortly after Nagin's announcement, all seven members of the governor's Advisory Committee on Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Issues   resigned  in protest.  The mayor's endorsement of the conservative Jindal was called "unconscionable and incomprehensible" by committee members.   CAREER ACHIEVEMENT  On Friday night, actress Nicole Kidman was   presented  with the Career Achievement Award at the 18th Annual American Cinematheque Award.  The 36 year-old actress was honored for her contributions to film.  Coming off last year's Best Actress Oscar for "The Hours", Kidman looks poised to be in the running once again with a troika of brilliant performances in "  The Human Stain " and the upcoming "  Cold Mountain " and "  Dogville ".    FEFE DOBSON  I had a chance to preview a few tracks from 18 year-old Canadian   Fefe Dobson's  upcoming debut album this weekend.  The first single "Take Me Away" is receiving heavy rotation video play and is starting to break at radio.  She an intriguing combination of rocker chick with soul, pop, and dance influences.  I'm curious to see how her music is received in the States.  Her eponymous debut drops December 9th on Island Records.  Meanwhile, you can hear two tracks on her website.
