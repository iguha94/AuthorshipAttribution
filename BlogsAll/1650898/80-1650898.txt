          WORDS OF THE YEAR 2003  Accordng to a report published yesterday by   yourDictionary.com , the number one word of 2003 was "embedded" (as in reporters doing the Iraq War).  It beat out the word "blog" for the top spot.  The full list of their Top Ten Words of 2003 is as follows:  01.  embedded 02.  blog 03.  SARS 04.  Spam 05.  taikonaut 06.  Bushism 07.  allision 08.  recall 09.  Middangeard 10.  celibacy  I'm not sure what that says about us that Tolkien, Bush, a disease and abstaining from sex are all in the top ten.  In the category of Top Ten Personal Names, Saddam Hussein takes the prize.  He beats out his nemesis W. (Dubya) at #2.  It's somewhat fitting and humorous that more people searched for Dubya than George W. Bush.  Unfortunately fame is such a fleeting thing.  Who is going to tell Paris Hilton that she came in at #8 behind the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Martha Stewart, the Pope and the governor of California (distressingly referred to as "Ahh-nold").  The horrors!  The top phrase of the year was the infamous "Shock-and-Awe".  My two personal favorites were #5 ("16 Words" referring to Bush's State of The Union faux pas regarding the purchase of uranium) and #10 ("Halliburton Energy Services").  The top Youth Speak words included "What Up!", "Stog" and "SNAG (Sensitive New-Age Guy)".  The most spoken word in the World remains the ever popular "OK".  Finally for your viewing pleasure, the top five mispronunciations by the President of the United States (I'm sure they were not want for material.):  01. a-MERR-ca  (America)  02. NEW-cue-ler  (nuclear)  03. JU-ler-ee  (jewelry)  04. Anzar  (Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar)  05. Ne-VAH-duh  (Nevada)
