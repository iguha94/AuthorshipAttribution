          MONTANA MADNESS  The conservative   Montana Family Coalition  is setting their sights on any companies who advertise during Bravo's 'Queer Eye On The Straight Guy'.  While such boycott and letter writing campaigns have been used by many conservative groups, this group is especially venomous.  Executive Director, Julie Millam is   quoted  as saying,  "To me, that's not a reality show about gay people.  A really good reality show for gay people would be five gay men dying of AIDS."  With compassion like that, I'm sure their campaign will get far.   TAB TELLS  In a recent press release announcing his forthcoming memoirs, actor   Tab Hunter  says acknowledges his homosexuality.  I was actually surprised because I didn't realize this was a secret. The golden boy of Hollywood's halcyon days first graced the screen in 1952 (at age 19) starring opposite leading lady Linda Darnell in 'Island Of Desire'.  He went on to make two movies with Divine ('Lust In The Dust' and 'Polyester') and the infamous 'Grease 2'.  His romantic relationship with Anthony Perkins was well known in industry circles.  Kind of strange how all these Hollywood heartthrobs are coming out of the closet.  First, Richard Chamberlain and now Hunter.  Who's next?   WHILE HE WAS IN  Fans of TLC's '  While You Were Out ' will know that there's a new hunky host--Evan Farmer.  Farmer is also pursuing a music career and has done film and television work.  His   website  features some pretty va-va-voom photos.
