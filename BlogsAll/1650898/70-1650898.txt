          EPISODE 7: PRELUDE  How totally kick-ass was last night's   "ALIAS" ?  Wow!  This season the show has really hit its stride. The acting is top-notch and the writing is engaging.  That opening scene with Sydney pulling the plastic tubing out from the mysterious scar on her abdomen was a shock--and terrifically done.  I know I've said it before, but I loves me some Jennifer Garner.  Now, Ms. Lauren Reed (Melissa George)--how much do I hate her?  It was a brilliant plot device to marry off Vaughn, but damn is this chick a witch or what?  Now to have to wait two weeks for the next episode...   BI-LINE: PRINCE CHARLES  So after issuing a stern denial through his press secretary to something that could not be spoken of in public, Prince Charles became fodder for internet junkies everywhere over the weekend.  Soon after the denial was issued, it was a media frenzy.  By the weekend, at least two Italian newspapers printed details of the allegations and named names.  The big   secret ?  An ex-royal servant claims he was raped by the prince's personal secretary (who is a male).  Further, he claims that he interrupted said rapist and the Prince in bed together.  Now, gossip whores are clamoring that Prince Charles could be bisexual.  Imagine that? Who'd have guessed? Yeah, right.    Things are going to get ugly.   A NEW PIECE  Here are a couple of shots of a new mixed-media collage that I completed this weekend.  The piece is triple coat decoupage with an acrylic overlay.  It is entitled "Cravings".           QUOTE OF THE DAY  " It makes no more sense to launch an assault on our civil liberties as the best way to get at terrorists than it did to launch an invasion of Iraq as the best way to get at Osama bin Laden.
