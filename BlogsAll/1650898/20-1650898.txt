          DEJA VU?  Oh, the irony of it all.  While Dubya chews down his "freedom fries", the French have perhaps had the last laugh.  Radical Frechman Thierry Meyssan has come up with his own    card deck  displaying the 52 most dangerous U.S. officials.  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was named the Ace Of Spades, Osama bin Laden labeled the Joker, and President Bush is the King Of Diamonds.  Bush's card carries a portrait with the following description: " Head of a baseball club and director of Salem bin Laden's oil company (brother of Osama). Designated President of the United States by friends of his father at the Supreme Court before the vote count showed that he lost the elections. "  Ouch!      TABLOID COUPLES  I've seen some true and untrue odd-pairings in gossip columns before.  I thought Nicole Kidman and Lenny Kravitz was a bit strange.  But, Fred Durst and Halle Berry?  Tongues are wagging after the two shared a   kiss  for a Limp Bizkit video.  Now, tabloids and gossip columnists abound with tails of Durst, Berry, & Benet.  Hmmm....who knows?  Apparently, Madonna will   appear  in the first clip from Britney Spears's new disc.  Guy Ritchie better watch out.     ER STAT  It was wonderful to see the beautiful and talented   Parminder Nagra  ("Bend It Like Beckham") make her debut on NBC's "ER".  She possesses this ethereal quality about her that is so enchanting.  Her scenes in the season premiere had such a quiet soulfulness to them.  She is utterly bewitching.    OO1 REBEL  While perusing Corky's most excellent   weblog , I linked over to Tom Of Finland's website to view the 'unveiling' of their new anatomically correct 'action figure'.
