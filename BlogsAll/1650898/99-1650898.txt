          HARVEY WEINSTEIN HAS A STROKE  The nominations for the 76th Academy Awards were   announced  this morning.  The screaming you heard was from the House of Miramax.  The much touted "Cold Mountain" was given a very big cold shoulder.  Despite a massive media campaign spearheaded by Weinstein, "Cold Mountain" failed to capture nominations in the Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Director categories.  While the film did pick up seven total nominations, Weinstein and company are not happy campers today.  The Academy was much more accomodating to Peter Jackson's "The Lord Of The Rings: The Return of the King" giving it a field best eleven nominations.  It appears to be the film with the most momentum and an odds-on favorite to win its share of gold.  A film that had seemingly lost its early buzz--"Master and Commander: The Far Side Of The World"--racked up ten nominations.  Interestingly, neither "Rings" nor "Master" picked up a single acting nomination.  The Academy did an intriguing job of mixing nominations among large budget pictures and smaller fare.  Among the biggest surprises was the nomination of thirteen year-old Keisha Castle-Hughes in the Lead Actress category for her work in "Whale Rider".  Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles was included in the Best Director race for the powerful, but little seen "City Of God".    My sentimental favorites among the nominations: Charlize Theron ("Monster"), Ben Kingsley ("House of Sand and Fog"), Djimon Hounsou ("In America"), Shohreh Aghdashloo ("House of Sand and Fog"), Renee Zellweger ("Cold Mountain").  Among the intersting snubs: Nicole Kidman ("Cold Mountain"), Tom Cruise ("The Last Samurai"), Jennifer Connelly ("House of Sand and Fog") and Russell Crowe ("Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World").
