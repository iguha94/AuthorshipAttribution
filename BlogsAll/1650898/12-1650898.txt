          BOY MEETS....  As much as I try to justify liking   "Boy Meets Boy" , there's this underlying uneasiness in my trying to form a perspective on the show overall.  Last night's show winnowed the field to three potential mates for the handsome   James .  As the episode drew to a close, host   Dani Behr  dropped the other shoe.  She informed James that one of the three remaining mates was straight.  The show closed with this "deer in the headlights" gaze that froze over the Leading Man's face.  I believe his only words were........"great.....".  Up until that point, I thought the show was making some interesting points about the traits and characteristics that are commonly accepted to identify a gay male.  When the reveals were done at the end of each episode, for the last two shows--I must admit to being extremely surprised about a couple of the "closeted straights".  I think the show made some salient points about gay/straight interaction and how looks and opinions can be deceiving.  Even the holy grail of gaydar seemed to not function for many of my gay friends.  Most of my straight friends were simply floored by the reveals.  To that extent, I think the show had something very positive to offer.  Looking beyond the simple fact that any show that deals with homosexuality--and is not necessarily produced for a gay audience--is a good thing, the show presented a very likeable Leading Man in James and a special friendship with Andra.  Their interaction was very honest--as was both their interaction with the mates.  But as James began to become emotionally invested in the dwindling cast of mates, the show seemed to step over some kind of boundary.  Maybe the intended lesson became less focused and more demeaning?  I think the preview clip of Andra's reaction to the news next week says it all.  Yes, they were all told it was a game.  But at some point, the game went from fun and interesting to cringe-inducing and uncomfortable.  Of the three mates remaining, I think James has the most invested in the relationships with    Franklin  and   Wes .  For some time, I wondered if Franklin might not be straight.  But as the show progressed, I've changed my opinion and now believe that Wes is perhaps the red herring.  I don't think the show's creators and producers ever intended to purposely hurt anyone, but somehow the sense of uneasiness grew with each successive episode.  An interesting side note, on CNN's segment " 90 Second Pop ", one of the panelists, B.J. Sigesmund (Enteratainment Reporter for  Newsweek ), mentioned that he had spoken with James after the filming of the show and claimed that he was very upset and felt betrayed by the twist in the show.  The reporter     said  that James told him he cried on the show.  It will be interesting to see how much of this reaction makes it off the cutting room floor.   ONE SMALL STEP FOR MAN...  As of yesterday afternoon I have murdered my 56K dial-up modem.  My cable company  finally  got with the program and began offering broadband access.  My laptop has been ready with an Ethernet card and now one Motorola SurfBoard Modem later, I'm seeing what I've been missing.  I guess after several years of dial-up access you get used to delays and slow downloads.  But, I am amazed at the difference.  This could be better than sex.  Wait.  Who am I kidding?  It's been so long since I've had sex, I wouldn't know.   THE O.C  The premiere episode of Fox's   "The O.C."  was a little shaky for me.  Granted they had a lot of exposition to get done in a short period.  By the second episode, the show has found a rhythm and the characters are more fleshed out.  It's an interesting show as it builds a multi-generational story and uses its cast to great effectiveness.  There are great performances from Tate Donovan, Peter Gallagher, and Mischa Barton.  The revelation of the show, in my opinion,  is Benjamin McKenzie, who portrays the troubled Ryan Atwood.  Now I think I understand the term "man-child".  There's something about him and his features that at times seems so adult--and yet there is this vulnerability that makes him childlike.  He's an interesting enigma.
