No Rick sightings today.  (sobbing uncontrollably)  I did catch a glimpse of something that cheered me up a little, though.  Gregg Jarrett was reporting from Baghdad.  He had some interesting things to tell, but I uh, can't exactly remember what they were.  I was too busy looking at him.  Lol!  He really is one of the Fox cuties.  He was standing out in the open somewhere and was wearing a shirt that was slightly unbuttoned.  I think that I detected a bit of chest hair.  Where is a magnifying glass when you really need it?  With a name like Jarrett, I assume that he's Irish (like Greg Kelly and Todd Conner), but I got to thinking about what someone here said about Fox having all of the hot Jewish guys.  Instead of "We report.  You Decide," or "Fair and balanced," how would you all like to see a Fox promo in which a female spokesperson comes out and says,  "Fox News - Home of all the hot Jewish guys... and a few others."  (Said with a wink and a smile and with photos of male Fox hotties as a backdrop)   Okay, it would probably never happen, thanks to unimaginative male execs at Fox, but it makes more sense from a marketing standpoint than the rap music promo that they currently have going in order to try to attract the MTV audience.       BTW, girls, Oliver North has a beautifully written column about our soldiers titled "What I learned at the war."  It's worth reading and you can find it at http://townhall.com/columnists.
