Hey gals, I've been busy with my sister visiting all weekend, we really didn't do anythiny special.  We had a cookout and when the food was ready it started raining!  I usually sit here on weekends trying to entertain myself but the one weekend that I have plans, my friends wanted me to go to a festival on Sat and boating on Sun, and I had to say no ***bummer***   Tommorow I get to find out what my boss (or rather his boss) does about that girl sleeping under her desk, should make for an interesting Monday.  I wasn't able to watch any Fox this weekend did I miss anything of relevence?  I did see however that one of the soldiers that was missing on Wed in Baghdad and found on Sat was from here in Columbus.  They have had his family on the local news, it is so sad...  Jen  So glad to see you posting!  I feel your pain girl, it seems like when someone says you can't have something it IS EVERYWHERE!  hang in there, your payoff will be worth it.    Melissa  Hope you didn't spend too much money at Barnes & Nobles, I can't escape that store without purchasing something either.  I agree with Nat in that I like this format so that I can reply to everyone's posts, but I never really used a message board either...but I'm new here so I'm not used to much.  I trust your decision!   BTW does the new sight have spell check?...because sometimes my brain just doesn't function and spelling is affected LOL  That is a really good idea about bending under my desk to hide the tears, that seems to happen to me a lot lately there.  Did you ever watch Seinfeld?  there is an episode where George has nothing to do all day at work so he decides to take a nap everyday under his desk, he brings a pillow, blankets, even an alarm clock...it reminded me of that girl yesterday.  Sherry   Glad to hear your camping trip was was good...I hope it was peaceful.     Jan   Yes, Rick did capitalize! I think it must be easier when handwriting something than typing it LOL  I agree with your thoughts on Anthony Michael Hall, I was thinking when he played geeky roles that this guy is going to grow up and be a dork!  Apparently I was wrong....I watch every episode of The Dead Zone.  I also watch Monk (yeah, I know I don't really have a life!).  Monk is hilarious..my brothers and I were talking about the show this weekend and they seem to think that there is a little bit of Monk in all of us...The show reminds me of the old show Columbo (my dad loved that show, I remember it as I was walking in from the next room to turn the channel for him LOL)..except Columbo and Monk are exact opposites....but the show is really good, I would recommend it.  a  I haven't seen Greg since Fri and he had the "two buttons" undone whew!  OMG  I loved Memoirs of a Geisha!  I couldn't put that book down...it was so interesting to read about another time and culture that I didn't realize existed.  Great book!  Nat    I seem to have at least three books going at the same time as well, I have ones that I bought recently, ones from the library, and ones on my bookshelf that I never got to that I suddenly feel the need to read all.  I'm working on four now.....Hope the editing is going well, I get crazy when I start reading some of my old stuff, sometimes I think "right on", other times I wonder if I was on another planet because the stuff is **way out there**and sometimes it is hard to get in the same mindset I was in when I originally wrote the stuff, so I get frustrated because I can't "fix" things. Keep us posted on the status!  I am also saying a prayer for you guys to get your pics!  You can clean that spot on your desk tomm.  BTW  I got a call from one of my best friends who moved to Nashville, she is engaged and I am going to be the maid of honor!  I have never been the maid of honor before, such responsibility!  I have to throw a bachelorette(sp?) party, does anyone know much about Nashville?  I haven't visited yet, so I have no idea where to go and who I would call for that kind of thing.  Goota go, Monday is only a few hours away...bad for me, good for those of you who are eagerly awaiting the visit from the mailman.....Good luck!
