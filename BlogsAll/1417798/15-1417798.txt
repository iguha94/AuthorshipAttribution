'Morning Ladies!  I have no idea what is going on with our internet at work today, but I can't see the comments on the blog- are you guys having the same problems?  I'm not sure if it's site specific or our connection here at work.  Everything here seems kinda slow, so it may be on my end.  OOOOHhhhhhh the guys are on Pat Sajak this weekend- thanks Sally for posting! And thanks for the links to the interviews Melissa!  I watched this morning....now THAT's more of what I've been waiting for! :D  One on one, instead of them both together.  (Well, now,  that  sounds kinda bad the way I put it! But you know what I mean.)  Melissa- what awful feeling did you have?  Hope all is OK now!  As to the guys if they did a show in the nude.......**at a loss for words**......uh, the only thing I can think of is HUBBA HUBBA!!  **drools**   Wow- there  are  a few of us crazy Scorpios here!  LOL- Leslie- I loved the "a surge in hormones wreaks havoc with one's ability to reason"-  HA!  So that could explain my lack of reasoning as of late- I think I'm stuck there- LOL!  Welcome Alisha!  Where in CA do you live?  It's nice to know there's another LevenGal here from CA :)  I know EXACTLY what you mean by recording the segments- I've started doing that and since we've had satellite (4 years now) I've  rarely  taped anything- now all of a sudden I'm taping the Fox News Channel- daily!  LOL!  I'm sure my hubby finds it strange (funny?)- he's asked me what I'm taping and I say "Studio B" or something like that.  He knows I think Rick is hot, and he teases me by saying "she's hot" whenever Greta comes on- LOL!  I've been taping Fox & Friends every morning just in case.....I don't think either of them were on there this morning- someone correct me if I'm wrong.  I have the VCR set to tape Studio B today....just in case. :D  Alright- gotta get to work now.
