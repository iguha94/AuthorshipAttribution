Nat, I'd trade you ten Todds, two Levy's and a Rosenblatt for a Shep.  I'll also give you my first round draft pick.  There is just something about that boy that makes my aged heart skip a beat.  As for height, Jay Leno is 6'1" and Shep was pretty even with him, I would put Rick between 5'10" and 6'.  And bless his little Marine heart, I'd be surprised if Greg was 5'10".  There aren't many 6' fighter pilots, can't fit in those little canopies. I don't get squeamish very easily.  I've dated too many cops, paramedics, etc. I sometimes come off as being a little calloused.  During my internship at KAMR, they always sent me out on the gore calls because I was the only one that could shoot the video without losing lunch. As far as scared, I'm more morbidly fascinated than scared.  I would probably have been voted Most Likely to Date Ted Bundy in high school. Tonight's libation of choice is Hurricane's so I'm not guaranteeing the spelling or rationale of this posting.  One of my college buddies came home from a business conference in New Orleans this weekend bearing gifts of Hurricane mix and Beignet mix.  You can indulge in one or the other, but it is morally wrong to have both at the same time. For you LevenGals, patience is a virtue.  May's sweeps is almost over, the books will come out sometime mid-June, and then there will probably be a bit of a station shuffle. News is news, but all tv stations (network and cable) live and die by the books.  The marketability of a reporter is just as important as his credentials, and the people selling the advertising want to be able to say, "Look, we have a huge fan base, loyal audience."  And ladies, 20-35 is a key demographic.  You have the power!  Just keep pressing TPTB and they'll get the idea. It looks like I'm going to have to turn everything off so Jay will finally get the idea that it's bedtime.  You ladies have a good night.  Lynne - wish your little one a Happy Birthday for us.
