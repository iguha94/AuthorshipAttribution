Good Monday Morning Ladies!!!  Well this is one Monday morning I am happy to have here, since it is my last day of work.  I'm walking around with a big grin on my face.  I'm also a little sad since I have made lots of friends here.  I have been here since I was 19 (15 years) so that is hard, but I won't miss the stress that it brings to all aspects of my life.  I'm sure I will be a much happier person at home which my husband will appreciate.  For everyone that asked about my camping trip, it was fun.  We went to Lake Raystown in PA.  It has like a 118 acre lake and a marina.  The camping is in the woods.  They have water slides, putt putt golf and lots of other stuff.  My parents live about 40 minutes from there so they came on Saturday to visit and have a cookout.  That was nice since I only get to see them like once a month.  Denise - I love The Dead Zone and the first time I watched it I couldn't believe that was Anthony Michael Hall.  He sure doesn't look the same.  He has really filled out as he has gotten older.  I was also excited since this last season had Sean Patrick Flannery in it who I love also.  He is such a cutie even though he is kind of a bad guy.   I'm wondering if Greg is still in Gaza since I haven't seen him since Friday and Amy Kellog was reporting there again this morning on Fox and Friends.  They usually seem to stay for about a month and he has only been there like 2 weeks so who know. Of course if he comes home he will be safe but then we probably won't see much of him, like in Rick's case.  Please let us know what your Boss does about the girl sleeping under her desk, I just can't believe that.  Of course if it is anything like my work they won't do anything.  Hey I think we all need to email Fox and let them know that we want war videos so we can get copies.  Maybe if they get enough request they will compile some.    Well gotta go clean my desk out and take all my pictures down.  I will post more later.  Bye
