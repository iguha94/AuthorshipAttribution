oh, Duran Duran...I went to their concert here St. Patrick's day 1983 !!!  It was wonderful.  My fav was Roger.  I always had a thing for drummers, love their arms.  The said part is I have all my favorite 80's that I bought on VINYL.  And if I really like them, I'll be honest, I also have them on cd.  I hate the fact that some are in "the bargin bin".  They treat 80's like "old 50's music". Nat - my dad used to pronouce INXS as "inks".  My sister and I had so much fun with him regarding that. Their first video had all the cats on the table while they were eating - like 25 people at the table.  My dad always seemed to see that on MTV when we were watching it and comment on how gross that was.  Our other favorite was "the knack, my sharona."  We would get up and dance this funny dance to the beat.  My dad was so funny about that stuff.  Even now, at 34, when the song comes on, we still get up and dance our weird dance. The Eagles kicked off their tour here in Richmond.  It was one of the best concerts I have ever seen.  This woman, about 50 something, drank too much before the concert, she passed out on her husband lap and missed most of it.  Our tickets, we were on the floor in front; row N, cost $130.  I can't imagine paying that much just to pass out!  Stupid. I got my hubby to show me how to do this im thing.  I got a chance to "talk" with Jen and Leslie last night.  my name is mwcgradll if any of you want to chat. gotta run, have a good night
