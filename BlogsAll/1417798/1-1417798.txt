Wow, talk about a dichotomy of days......I get to work, and think hmmmm......I guess I'll check my alternate email....I'm *sure* I won't have a response today from Rick, as I just emailed last night.  I open my email to find one new message- from  Leventhal, Rick .  After I've hyperventillated and sqealed a little (inwardly, but a little squeak escaped), I read what he wrote:   your photo is signed and will soon be delivered! thanks for watching, and caring. it's gratifying to know my hard work is appreciated... and i'm humbled by all the interest in me! take care and please stay tuned, rick   All I can say, is WOW.  Like my blog buddy Melissa, I can't stop grinning from ear to ear!  She got a response to her email yesterday and was just sooooo happy & surprised- we're both in absolute heaven now!!  Now, I have to just hope that the PO doesn't lose it.......*sigh*  Work sucks today, though.  Long story, too long to get into here- suffice it to say that I'm getting crap that I shouldn't be getting.  And no one wants to take it back, and no one's telling me what to do with it when I ask.  Well.  I have a suggestion........ ; )  I'll be ladylike though, and leave that to your imagination!  It's just really frustrating.....oh so many times *I* could have gone out on stress leave....but didn't.  I just don't believe in doing that (me, personally anyway.  I think it's spineless.).  These people go out on so called stress, well, what the hell do they think is happening when they leave?  We're *all* under stress, some of us just know how to deal with it better than others, I guess.    Oh, but my Rick email.......wow.  I'm just flabbergasted that he emailed back- so quickly!! We're talking less than 12 hours.  OMG...
