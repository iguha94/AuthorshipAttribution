LMAO, Teri! Heh heh- it *does* make me wonder what is going through his mind about all these emails he's getting!  I'm hot now, but that's 'cause I was working out trying to work off the heavy lunch I had today.  It was *hot* here today- I don't know what it was in the City, but in Marin, it was 90 when I got home- and that was at 4:30.  It's not that bad considering other parts of the country are 100+ (like my homestate- AZ), but when you don't have a cooler or AC (at least not on the boat), it's *hot*.  My poor kitty keeps laying on the wood floors for coolness- lol!  Time for the natural AC to come in (i.e., FOG)!   I noticed that Rick replied to me in the AM- I checked around 7:15 my time and from what I could tell, he sent it at 6:15 my time (which would be 9:15 NY time).  So check bright & early! :D  You never know!  Of course, we want *all* the details *when* he writes back! :D  Lynne- Now *that* must have made the class interesting!  History of Christianity taught by an athiest.....Yep- religions are definitely man made.  My hubby grew up Catholic and his parents really stopped going when the chuch was not going the direction they thought it should be (same reason that I've heard many Catholics say).  He graduated from St. Thomas in Houston- an all boys Catholic school.  Wait a minute- you left out Todd! ;D  No offense Leslie, but I want to trade Shep for Todd!  LOL!!  I don't see Rick as being that tall- like 5'10"?  Shep looks like he'd be around 6'.  (LOL- I hope I got the "feet" & "inches" marks correct!)  Yeah, were all GutterGals today, (today? maybe last few days-lol)!  I was thinking of asking to try the singulair or zyrtec- I think zyrtec is the one that handles both indoor & outdoor allergies, which is what I really need.  Hopefully those will be better on her than the zombifying stuff!
