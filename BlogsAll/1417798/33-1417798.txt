I'm beginning to feel odd-girl-out tonight. With all the e-mails I've sent Shep, not one reply.  It's not like he's the second most trusted anchor or one of the 10 most influential newspeople - oh, wait a minute, yes he is.  But still, with my pithy comments and smooth Southern charm, one would think I would have received something.  At this point, I think I would even be happy with the aforementioned restraining order.  At least I'd know he (or someone) read them.  Nat - something just occurred to me.  How am I going to explain Shep to my husband?  I mean, a respected news anchor just shows up at your house, "Honey, I traded 10 Todd's, 2 Levy's and a Rosenblatt for him.  Can I keep him?"  Worse, where are you going to fit 13 news reporters on that boat of yours?  Do you even have enough places for them to sit? Or are you going to have to tie a little skiff behind your boat for them?  Just something to think about before we finalize this trade.  So, guys, when you get your little secret club together, will I still be welcome?  Since, Rick and Shep are best buds, surely my obsession with the friend of your obsession qualifies me for honorary membership.  Pleeeeeease?  With a Koala Baier on top? (or on bottom, whatever your personal pref.)  It's late, it has taken me 30 minutes and three bedtime stories (Green Eggs and Ham, Where the Wild Things Are, and If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, classics all) to get this written, so now I'm going to publish and go to bed with the satisfaction of knowing that if I don't get to join the club, at least I get to see my guy twice a day, five days a week. Nyah. So there.  (Pretty, pretty please with Todd Connor on .... oh, never mind, I'm sure ya'll know where this is headed.)
