That's weird- the blog looks like it did after they did the update (no divided screen to see the posts as you type).  Is there something I'm missing here (like something I need to click) or is it Blogger itself?  PU- so far nada this morning (so it didn't get here Saturday.....but I think they're still working on today's mail, and not only that they seem to be slow (as mentioned before) a lot of the time.  Hopefully today or tomorrow.  I *have* sorta had a streak of luck in the last 12 hours (except for sleep- only got 4 hours).  Did ya'll catch the Fox Magazine last night?  Rick was on about the suicide of the PA miners rescuer....which I thought had aired before....but this time was different.   Unless I completely missed it last time, in this airing, he was walking through the area (presumably) where the mining accident took place.  And he was wearing jeans.  Dark jeans.  With a pale blue shirt.  OMG.  This was around 11:45 PM my time- prolly why I couldn't sleep- LOL!  And then this morning, Todd's been on Fox & Friends and then Fox News Live reporting from CT about Katherine Hepburn's death.  I'm sure he'll be on a lot today about that, but at least I got to see him twice.  I had a hard time waking up this morning, but *THAT* got me going- I was *wide* awake then!  :-D  MmmmHmmmm......  OK- I just wanted to post that stuff really quick- I'm going to have to catch up reading during lunch today.  I have a million things to do- including putting my contacts in so I can see! LOL (So pardon any mistypes here- LOL). Later!
