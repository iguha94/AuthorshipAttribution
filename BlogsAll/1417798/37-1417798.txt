Melissa - I also sent Shep an email asking him to have Rick guest on his show.  I'm sure any such decision would have to be made by Shep's boss, but maybe Shep will try to convince Fox to let it happen.  An hour with the two of them would be heavenly, but at the very least Fox could allow Rick to join in when Jane Skinner brings in goodies for Shep to sample and give us ten minutes of conversation between munches.    I've wondered if Rick is going to write a book about the war in Iraq.  I read someplace that Greg Kelly was supposedly planning on writing a book on his experiences.  Greg was apparently on TV four to six times yesterday.  I have a feeling that Fox deliberately put him on that many times, even after the La. serial killer suspect had already left Atlanta, because they knew that there were a lot of Fox fans who wanted to see Greg.  Possibly, they'll give the same treatment to Rick if a story ever breaks that he can report on.  As far as names for your page, I like rickleventhalfans and levyateleven.  I tried to think of something to go with Rick, but all that I could think of was rickschicks or scruffyrickrules.  (scruffyrickrules would, of course, require a scruffy Rick pic from his embed days.)    Sherry - I was thinking of Bret Baier as a teddy bear, but koala bear works just as well, if not better.  He impresses me as a thorough, careful reporter, who's easygoing and polite.  At the Pentagon briefings, he asks good questions, but he's always respectful, unlike some of the other reporters.  He's single, too.  During the war when some of the Fox reporters were working late, Shep mentioned that Bret had left because he had a date.
