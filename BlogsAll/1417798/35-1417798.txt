Nat - I know when I was writing I wanted to sound mature and stuff but I'm not very good at putting my thoughts to paper.  I complimented him on the great war coverage.  I also mentioned about hearing him on DC101 and didn't realize he was a Maryland native like me.  I told him I enjoyed his stories he told with his friend when he was on the radio about going to Rehoboth Beach.   I told him it was great to see him back and to keep up the great work.  I didn't ask for a picture but wish I would have.  Next time.  Also I read on another site that Todd is very good at responding to email.  Don't know if you had emailed him yet but you might want to give it a try.  Melissa - He might do an interview if you make a list of questions.  When I joined the yahoo group (sweetrickleventhal - or something like that). I was looking through all the post and the owner of that site sent him a list of questions and he answered them.  It was back last year sometime but I remember seeing it and he answered a lot of questions.  I thought that was great that he took the time to do that.  I remember one of the questions was about his daughters and he had said something like they are beautiful, smart and amazing in every way.  I thought that was so sweet.  So if you told him it was for your site and that we all have questions he would probably do it.  Jan - Congrats on getting a response, I know you will be watching the mail everyday.  LOL
