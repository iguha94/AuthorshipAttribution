Good Morning Ladies!!  Wasn't on the computer much last night so there are a lot of post to read.  Denise - Oh my, me an you think so much a like.  I'm going to see Pearl Jam on July 1st and I was just talking to my friend yesterday about what time we are going ot meet and I said to her that I hope Eddie just sings and doesn't start lecturing us on his political views.  I told her I didn't pay $50.00 to hear a political speach but to hear them sing.  Did you hear about the first night of their opening concert that he was running his mouth about the war and stuff and people were leaving the show.  I had already bought my tickets when I heard about this and I was like I hope every show isn't like this or I just wasted my money.  Let me know how it is since you are going before me.  Nat - I like all 80's music.  I love Duran Duran.   My husband orderd this CD collection from Colubmia House that is like a Modern Rock/New Wave collection of 80's songs and it is awesome.  I love all kinds of music but now I mainly listen to bands like Staind, Linkin Park, Puddle of Mudd.    Melissa - Wow you are getting through that book quick.  I still haven't read Books 1-4.  I need to borrow them from my brother and read them but I have about 100 other books to read too.  Leslie - I have read Bill O'Rielly's first book and have his 2nd one to read but haven't had time.  I am getting ready to start Sean Hannity's book now.  I'm hoping once I"m not working starting next week I can catch up on all my reading.  I also love to read mystery/romance books.    Shep was pretty funny last night at the end when he was doing his G Block.  He is such a goof sometimes.  He is always good for a laugh.  Well gotta get to work.  Us east coast girls are in for another pretty day.  YEAH!!!
