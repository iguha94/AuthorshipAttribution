Wow look at me 2 posts in one day -- must be the near ten hours I've got w/o percocet ... well the dr. said drink more so I have it might not sound like a lot but I've drunk like 1 1/2 cups of water which is a lot since my new "pouch" is aprox. 2 oz!!! (eventually    But I do take some solace in the people that have had the surgery - my friend Cheryl can eat cheese enchiladas, 1/2 steak and cheese sub (why did I just write that?!) even That's Amore Italian food!! - some nurse I met can eat that wonderful filet mignon I love so much - two women that use to "live" at my fav. resturant a lot w/ me can still go there and eat steak and chesse subs w/ FRIES  -- Having wrote all that good food I have "expanded" my list of food -- sure I'll start out with grilled cheese and ceaser salad but oh about four months out yes I will get my 1/2 steak and cheese sub   I won't give the entire game away and tell my entire percocet laced Greg Kelly fantasy but I will say that Greg got pretty jealous of (so sorry Melissa) me and Rick -- so jealous that my mom said I was damn near dancing in my sleep ... I'll let you guys interpret that one ;)  Well *Leslie* I gave you and 'um' about if I would be up and no, no more percocet but I am a little sleepy and do need to finish my water and that'll take me about an hour -- I'll talk to you def. tomorrow after I go to the evil doctors and he hurts me ... oh my mom thinks I've lost close to the 10 POUNDS already in a week, my mom could but sneaking in some percocet to say something like that but dunno we'll see for sure tomorrow  Later guys! Have a good FOOD FILLED night!!! ;p
