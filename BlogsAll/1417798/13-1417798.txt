Hehehe- I know this is heinous, (and this is a *very* long story and it all won't be told here.....) but in having to do court searches for something totally unrelated, I found out that my first ex is now the respondent of yet *another* divorce! I know we both had our faults (mine was just been too young, stupid & naive) but this makes me feel so much less of a failure (in an odd, and yes, probably inane way)- but still. I'm *very* surprised. One would have to know and understand the whole situation to understand my thoughts on this- it was one of the harder parts of my life to go through; I had nightmares for a few years after our separation & divorce. Like knife-wielding-gun-pointing *AT ME* kind of nightmares. It truly makes me wonder what happened in his other two marriages- why they didn't work out. I think when it came down to it, I was too young- 1.5 months 19; I truly believe that he was a rebound from my first boyfriend before him (he was my 2nd) who I really didn't get over until around 1990 or 1991. I used to blame the age difference (7 years)- but I think it was just that we didn't have much in common. In 1990 I 'found myself again' and my eyes were wide open and I then knew I had to get out. You know the Tori Amos song, "Silent All These Years": "I hear my voice...and it's been here.....silent all these years". I know all this will come out in novel form someday- or a memoir. Sometimes I think my life is bo-ring, but in retrospect, I suppose it's been pretty interesting so far- some things I regret of course, but I suppose I wouldn't be where I am or who I am today if they didn't happen.                    </post>
