They just mentioned something on FOX that there's a general terror alert regarding the targeting of nuclear power plants in the country- I'm sure (I hope!) that nothing will happen, but dang, I don't think we ever get used to these alerts.  I just get chills whenever they mention them.  What was really scary was that a couple of months ago I'd heard that the Palo Verde nuclear plant just outside Phx, AZ was under heavy guard- all of my side of the family (except my sis) lives in the Phx metro area.  Just the thought of possibly losing my whole family was just absolutely gut wrenching chilling- ironically enough, I was more worried about it than they were-lol!  It was like nothing to them (???????)  I didn't get it.  But, the whole events of 9-11 & after are really surreal to me- sometimes I sit back and think, "whoa, did that REALLY happen??" (I'm having one of those profound moments now).  It just serves to remind that things really are different now and we have to be alert.  When I hear a plane flying low over downtown SF, I always look up to see where it is.  I wasn't even in NYC (never been there even), and yet I cannot hear a plane the way I used to hear it.  When that happened in NYC, I thought for sure somewhere on the west coast would be next- Seattle?  SF? LA?  Who knows- all I know is that it was a very uncertain time and I was at work when the plane hit the Pentagon and I just wanted to go home and couldn't track down my hubby.  I was reading something at the MSN Group (Fox News Channel Central) on the page created for Rick, and I have to say I really admire him for dashing down there to cover and experience what was happening.  That had to be such a raw emotional experience for him.  Kudos to him for covering it so well!!  Well, I dunno what got me on that- sorry!!  Yeah, I'm wondering when Rick's going to be back and what he'll be mostly appearing on.  I would think it would be Studio B- but I could be wrong- what's your opinion?
