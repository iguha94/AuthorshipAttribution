Melissa - Didn't Shep call his late night chats with Rick Levy at Eleven?  How about levy@eleven for your site name?  Yes, I did call Mr. Baier a Koala, so I guess that makes him a Koala Baier.  Ellen F - Welcome!  We are a little nuts around here, but completely harmless (to each other, that is.  I wouldn't give Rick, Shep, Greg, or any of the other FOXes a snowball's chance in hell if they accidentally wandered into our midst.)  Just relax and go with it.  It will seem less scary that way.  Lynne - I'm a statuesque 5'8", too, and understand the need for tall men.  We've got to at least try to appear petite, right?  My husband is 6'2", too, and looks like a Marine recruiting poster.  Sweet, kind and gentle, but a little scary-looking.  I must admit my admiration for someone who can juggle dirty thoughts and dirty laundry at 8 am.  That is truly a gift.  Jaylee's graduation from PPCD to Kindergarten was this morning.  She looked adorable in a tiny black robe and mortar board. They're both going to be in the same classroom next year, our school is so tiny that K-6 special education is in the same room.  Even adding Jay, there will only be 3 kids in the class next year.  The teacher-aide/student ratio is 4-3 right now.  Both girls require full-time personal aides.  If we were in Amarillo, the t-a/student ratio is 1/6.  God bless the small town school.  I'd better get off here, I just got pelted in the back of the head with mac'n'cheese.  Things are getting a little wild at Casa Appling. Ya'll have a good one.
