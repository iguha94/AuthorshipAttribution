Ellen- Good to see you posting!  It was me who likes Todd (as well as Rick)- I still can't believe I missed him today.  Gotta start paying attention to the voices when that's all you can see/hear & when I come in on the middle of a segment.....  Jan- I thought about getting that video- lol- actually I was thinking about DVD....had all my favorites on there.  Now *THAT* really brings me back to Christmas 1984- it was good & bad- I was in one of those "awakening" or epiphany stages you go through being a teenager, plus it was the first Christmas after my Grandpa died.  Live Aid- I watched sooo much of that and if we had a VCR I would've taped it all.  Can you believe, 1985, and when we wanted to watch videos, we rented a VCR??? We didn't get a VCR till later 1985- like around Christmas.  That seems so late to me now.  LOL- I'm going to have to check out TYO on DVD....good idea, thanks! :-D   Sorry ShepHerders, but ROFLMAO about even imagining Shep with facial hair!!  Never thought about that till you mentioned it- hehehe.  Shep's *much* better cleanshaven.   OK- I'll check in with ya'll in the AM- gotta get settled in for bed (yeah, it's only 8:30 here, but I have to start early so I can wind down and be able to sleep).  Have a good one!
