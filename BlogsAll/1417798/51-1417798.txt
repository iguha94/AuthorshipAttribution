At the risk of injuring Jen, just had to say that the seafood-stuffed manicotti in white wine cream sauce came out rather well.  The girls even ate it. I'm afraid the sensible dinner I promised Jen got out of hand. I have left-over strawberry-cream cheese blintzes if anyone is interested.  Mike Tobin squinting in the sunlight just reminded me so much of Gopher from Winnie the Pooh.  Small head, big body, squinty eyes.  I am sooooo looking forward to watching a R-rated movie this weekend. When everything reminds you of a cartoon, you're watching too many cartoons.  Since Rick is such a nice guy and answers all his e-mail and sends requested pictures, what do you think my chances are for e-mailing him a request for a picture of Shep?  Or Shep and him? Or just e-mailing a request for Shep?  Speaking of, who let him dress himself this morning? Mr. Smith should never be allowed to wear anything lighter than a pearl grey, and definitely NOT tan.  Roy sent me a dozen yellow roses today with the time until our anniversary counted out in seconds on the card.  I'm just wondering how long it took him to figure all that out.  He's such a big softie. Just makes it so darn hard to lust after Shep. No, no, it's okay. I'll manage.  Melissa, that is a great drawing. The face reminds me of Pokemon (where is that R-rated movie?!).  She certainly seems well-endowed.  I hope Harry is a breast-man, but aren't they all?  I've just missed you guys so much I feel like a great big group hug. Ya'll take it easy.
