Ok, Ok, I know I've been kinda defunct and have neglected to do these when I should.  They're very thought provoking and and levity to my Friday- something to look forward to.  So here goes:  1. What food do you like that most people hate? Lima beans.  There's also eggnog- I *love* eggnog.....especially Baskin Robbins' ice cream cake with eggnog ice cream and white cake. Mmmmmm......  2. What food do you hate that most people love? *ANY* seafood.  I do *not* eat seafood- it's a taste and aesthetic thing.....  3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you? Uh.....I'm sure there's an obvious one out there, but they're not coming to mind at the moment.  One I know of is Bill Clinton *ugh* *scratches head* I have  no  idea  how  anyone can find him attractive (eww, God, that hurt to even put into the same sentence).     4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive? Rick Leventhal of Fox News Channel (was embedded in Iraq earlier this year).  Hehehe- there were others in years past, but those will *always* be my secret.    5. What popular trend baffles you? Pants hanging past people's asses & multiple piercings (although, I think that may be on the way out?).  Again, I'm sure there's *something* out there that I'm just not thinking of at the moment. I'll do an update if it comes to mind during the day....
