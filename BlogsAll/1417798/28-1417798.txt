Teri - OK you caught me, I'm his girlfreind. There's no use denying it any more. LOL just kidding! But in all truthfulness, I doubt either one of them is reading the blog.(maybe his daughters? - I could only imagine how grossed out they would be LOL) I'm sure if they were reading it then, as Leslie says, I'd have been served with a restraining order by now. What, with my dreams and constant giddiness -- he'd be a little frightened I would say. LOL! Sorry he didn't write you back today. =( Perhaps he had already left the office by the time you sent the third e-mail and maybe he was busy today. You know working on that story for this weekend. =)  Natalie - I'm so sorry you had a bad day at work. I hope you find your passion. Perhaps writing is it. Just think how you feel when you get the chance to sit down and immerse yourself into a story that you've been going over in your head. How excited do you get when a story starts evolving on paper? I love to write too, but I always draw a huge blank when I try to write a full blown story. Perhaps that's why I love reading so much, because someone else has done the writing for me, and all I have to do is read it. =)  Leslie - ick 101!!?? That sucks. It was 90 here today, but it's supposed to cool off and be like 75 tomorrow. LOL I love the skanky dessert hat! I'll go on a hunt to find one now --- *searching* -- here we go now YOU ALL can have    YOUR VERY OWN SKANKY DESERT HAT!   via www.armynavyshop.com =)
