SCORPIO (Oct 23–Nov 22):  Conflicts with others don't have to be a difficult thing -- although they often more problematic than not. Today, you may find yourself at odds with the needs of those around you, but it really isn't as bad as it may seem. Some of the interaction is based on misunderstanding. You're going to have to listen with great intent in order to untangle what's really going on. Try not to drag others into your process while resolving your own internal conflicts.  I *know* there's a lot I can pull from the above....but I sometimes have a difficult time trying to see a few people's sides to issue (I'll admit that I feel like they are *completely* out there & selfservant).  I'm a little blunt today, what can I say?  It's the way liberals and idiots affect me, unfortunately..... Today *will* be better than yesterday though- I'm going to do my very best to see that it is.  :-)   I just love these little wisdoms!   Daily Buddhist wisdom:  Do not follow the ideas of others, but learn to listen to the voice within yourself. Your body and mind will become clear and you will realize the unity of all things.  The Buddha meditated for six years, Bodhidharma for nine. The practice of meditation is not a method for the attainment of realization—it is enlightenment itself.  -Zen Master Dogen, "The Practice of Meditation"   Daily Hindu Wisdom:  What is the use of thinking?  Once and for all,  Give up meditation. Hold nothing in your mind.  You are the Self,  And you are free.  -Ashtavakra Gita 15:20
