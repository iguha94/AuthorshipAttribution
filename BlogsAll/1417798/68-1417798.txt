LOL- I had intentions of getting the cleaning done first before I came back to the computer, but just haven't been able to resist checking in (and downloading some Tori Amos songs).  Denise- ah, OK- that's right (sorry I have severe brain fade sometimes!) - so Jan should also hopefully be receiving hers today too since she's in the midwest as well.  Actually we get our mail at the PO box in SF (we're in San Rafael) since it's more convenient to get to from where I work.  Fortunately it's been convenient to reach from both jobs I've had since we've had it.  Sure gives me incentive to go in though!  Plus I don't think the hubby would like to see that I got something from Rick- LOL!  I'm always the one to go check since it's more convenient for me, unless I run out of time or if I stay home - then he goes to check.  Do any of you watch "Monk" on USA on Friday nights?  The one last night was good- he puts this letter in the box & actually sticks around to make sure the mailman gets it.  My hubby laughed and said something about me being like that.  Yeah, I'm a little mail intensive- I'm always concerned that something will be lost or I won't receive something (gee- wonder what that "something" is- LOL!).  Actually when you consider how much mail goes through the system, it's a wonder we get what we do.  What he wrote was short & sweet!  (Although, as it's fairly short- makes you wonder why it took so long, huh!)  We'll see what he puts on Jan's & mine- prolly the same- I'm sure they all have a similar way of signing- short and to the point.  How exciting!!  I just bet you're floating on air today!  Are you going to put a copy up at work?  I'm thinking about it.....I've got a blank space of wall that I cleared out about three weeks ago..... OK- back to work. ;-p
