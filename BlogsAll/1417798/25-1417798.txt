Jan- Yeah, that's what I told the girl who got the call- I said that I didn't care if he has Dr before his name or MD after- NOT cool at all.  Yeah-especially these days, who makes threats like that? It's just not smart- it's like making a joke while going through the metal detector at an airport- just uncalled for and immature- and this guy is like 63, old enough to know better! Ah yes- I know San Jose- we were just there in April to see Tori Amos in concert.  Oh my God.....the HIPAA thing....yeah, we've been briefed on that- thank God our legal & risk management depts are taking care of that and not us in underwriting!  It sounds like a real nightmare...I always thought it was private too, until we were informed about it.  It sounds confusing having all those different trash cans!  I forget where you live- I see Peoria- is that Illinois?  Yeah- the humidity is prolly the worst especially when it gets above 80 or 85.  It gets like that in Austin in the summer I think- we've been there a couple of times where it's been 105 w/ ninety-something percent humidity.  In AZ, they always said "yes, it's hot (115 degrees for ex.), BUT IT'S A DRY HEAT".  I always hated that phrase- hot is hot.  But, I found that yes, the humidity makes it *a lot* worse.    Oh, hey- I forgot something earlier.  I went to my newsstand by the PO & when I had come down the stairs that go right by it, I saw that they had a Fox News sign thing in their window- prolly like 3 ft by 4ft - boy did that catch my eye!  I remember thinking at the time, "wow, check that out!" followed by "if only I'd see an envelope in my box like that (with Fox News)" LOL  OK- gotta get my contacts out & get some sleep!   **SWEET DREAMS EVERYONE**!!!!
