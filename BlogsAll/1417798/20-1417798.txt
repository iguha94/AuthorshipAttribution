I ordered my khaki skanky desert boonie hat! :D  I ordered from South Summit - I believe that was one of the ones that Melissa listed.  Melissa- Look at it this way- as a photojournalist to be, you're an "inspired inventor"- seriously! :D  You find the right shots that are inspiring, and you're inventing in a sense. How you describe the heat & humidity (which I got to experience in TX) sounds like the way my grandma described it when she was still living in Indiana.  She said when they were getting ready to move to AZ (over 50 years ago), she had to take a lot of breaks 'cause it was so hot & humid it was hard to breathe & just dripping with sweat.  Yuck!  That's why, I guess, that she's more appreciative of the "dry heat" in AZ.  Not knowing the other at the time I was still living in AZ, I could see how I was naive.   Mmmmm....auction it off....so, I guess we can keep checking Ebay -under "skanky desert hat" - LOL!!    Man, what is it with Geraldo?  *WHY* is he covering *everything*?? (Well, OK, maybe not *everything*, but it sure feels like that!!  Girls, if I was attracted to him, I'd be in hog heaven since he's on so much.  But I'm not.  I think I'm going to have to be more specific too, about requesting Rick sightings from the FOX angel or faerie, whichever you want to wish on.....Rick *L* not Rick *F*- LOL!  I keep wishing for "Rick" without specifying "L".  I keep getting Rick F.
