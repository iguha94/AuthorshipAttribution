Hey Guys   Well last post as a "big girl" :) as Leslie told me "tomorrow er today EST is the first day of your skinny-ass life" I have some deep and meaningful thoughts but since I'm just coming down off my sugar high (My Frienda Amanda, you know here "in the morgue by 9 a.m." took me to IHOP at 10 o'clock for dinner) it'll prolly come out as rambling...  -Lynne & Jan I'm so sorry I missed the time to chat but got the messages -- thank you so much for your well wishes tonight! In fact THANK YOU ALL for your well-wishes throughout the day and since I posted about it -- I have to be honest I was a little embarassed or shy about telling you guys but we really are a psuedo family so it's all good  - Melissa, my Melissa -- how many nights have we entertained each other through our insomnia patches! With our little logos, our "theories"  - "Jen, I'm trying to be serious" I stand by what I said I will never ever be able to pay you back for what you did w/ that e-mail -- but I'll make sure to sit you next to Rick at Greg and I's wedding reception hahaha  - Leslie: so many words, so many things to say to my hussy idol but like Melissa your 'hugs' and 'counseling' that you've given me since we got on this blog are the best and I'll depend on you to refresh my memory of those after all the morphine and painkillers OR if Greg calls  - Natalie: I always think backwards take oh I dunno Greg...well got the oatmeal today for the baby, got the baby food over the past two weeks, had the shotgun wedding two weeks ago, meet him on the subway in MARTA   - The funniest thing my surgeon has ever said to me: "Eventually you'll be able to eat salad"   - The more I think about the baby food I'll have to buy maybe I will pull the ol' wool over some of the people's eyes "Stupid Fox network knew I was expecting and off to Gaza they sent him.." no no no I won't -- I couldn't do it w/o laughing  - Thank you guys again for all your wishes and prayers and they all mean so much to me for you guys to think so much of me! I'll try to post a little on Friday when I get home inbetween vitamins, protein shakes, food and that lovely crushed brand of percocet... P-E-A-C-E
