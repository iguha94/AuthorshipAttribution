Lynne- my favorite was Roger too!  Then after he left, it was Simon.  Check this out.....I don't know if you've heard- and I don't remember where I heard, but supposedly they're all back together- John, Simon, Roger, Andy & Nick- and working on new stuff.  They have an official site with a picture  here .  You can go to  www.duranduran.co.uk  and  www.duranduran.com  to see more stuff too.  I got curious one day after I thought I'd heard them getting back together & did a Google search & that's what I found.  I've about always been a day late & a dollar short...I got into them about a week after they came to AZ in Feb. 1984.  I think I still have my buttons & books in storage somewhere.  Just couldn't part with it (hey, I've said before that I'm a packrat!). LOL  Don't feel bad- I got a bunch of stuff on CD that I had on vinyl- yeah, don't you hate the "bargain bin" thing??  I remember that INXS video!  Was it "The One Thing"?  I had a friend that made up a dance for "Pop Muzik"- it was a blast.  Whoa- that's a lot for a concert (especially to pass out....)!  We were thinking of going to see them- I should check out their latest dates- I'd checked before, but haven't checked for updates for awhile.  My dad & stepmom have seen them and the Rolling Stones in Vegas a couple of times.  They live in AZ, but Vegas has some good venues so they go up there. I really think I get my music know-how from my dad- he & I've pretty much always known who does what.  For all the 80's (& 70's & 90's) fun stuff, I'm a rock n roll girl at heart.  My dad went through 2 vinyl LPs of Led Zep's first album- LOL- he wore them out.  He now has it on CD.  Hmmm....must be where I also feel the need to play music LOUD from.....
