BWAH HA HA HA HA!!!!!  This was so cool....you can pick all the pieces of a conspiracy and make your *own* conspiracy.  Here's what I came up with:   "Do you want to know the truth about coffee beans? For 17 years, Sen. Kerry has been suppressing information from you about coffee beans and thus endangering the welfare of the Irish.  In July 1996, George W. Bush met with Todd Connor in San Francisco to discuss smoking. As it happens, they engaged in gluttony and ended up hatching a plan involving the liberals in the US.  As a result, all details of the meeting were suppressed, as was information about dealings with GE and their ties to robbing.  A report in Time was mysteriously pulled from newsstands in November of last year. The article implicated high-ranking officials in PETA, various ditch diggers, and, perhaps not surprisingly, Rick Leventhal. According to the report, passages in the book "The Savage Nation" and lyrics in Tori Amos 's music point to a connection between these individuals and coffee beans.  According to a spokesman at Time, the issue was pulled because of printing errors. However, individuals who saw the original copies say that there were no printing irregularities and that the re-issue differed from the original only in the absence of this article.  The lies and deception must be stopped. Don't let the government hide the facts about coffee beans any longer. Learn the truth!"
