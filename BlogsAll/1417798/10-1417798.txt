In general this is not a favorable day for you. News that holds you back from work may come your way. An associate may be critical and arrogant. Your fortunate astrological number for today is 310. Your financial outlook for today is very good. Your compatible sign for today is Aries.   LOL! With that kind of horoscope, who'd even *want* to get out of bed???  Of course, I have to laugh because this has been my  *week* .  I work with quite a few arrogant & critical people.....one in particular.  I 'helped' her out while she was in a class this week and I'm *sure* I prolly did something wrong, but I don't give a fat rat's ass.  If I did then I don't care, 'cause *nothing* pleases this person anyway.  Besides....I didn't do it out of my own choosing- it was my supervisor who asked, so be it. ;-p     Here's a better one:   SCORPIO (Oct 23–Nov 22): At times it makes you a little crazy when you can see so deeply into what's beneath the surface, but you can't talk about it to others. Whether it's that they just don't want to know or that they don't have the capability to fully understand the complexity of what you see, you are left alone to experience something very profound. You'll find someone to share it with later, but probably not today.   This one kinda strikes home a little.  There are many times I feel this way, but part of the problem is trying to put the profound into words.  Sorta impossible.  Someone who *would* actually really see what I mean?  Unique.
