Jan - Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Oh yeah, and mea culpa.  I will never rub your collective noses in it again.  Besides, there's more than enough Shep to go around; he can be your Rick Proxy. ROTFLMAO!  I hadn't thought about it, but that could be a Manliness Test.  Clowns? Decorating or Target Practice?  When we got married, Roy's mom gave us his childhood bedroom decorations that she and Roy's aunt made.  Clock, lamp, wall hangings, bedding, bank, all clowns.  Scary clowns.  Now that I think of it, that really explains a lot about my honey.  Roy took one look at the stuff, thanked his mom, packed it away, and we haven't seen it again in the last 10 years.  He picked out the decor for Sarah's room, Noah's Ark, with the statement that he was pretty sure Noah didn't allow clowns on the ark.  Nat - If Rick mailed it himself, the picture should be here shortly.  If the FOX news publicity department mailed it, no telling.  They probably process thousands of requests and do a bulk mailing, Third Class.   Just remember, good things come to those who wait. Patiently.  As the mom of two small kids, I must admit that the only movies I've seen in the last 8 years (in the theater) have been G-rated animations.  I long for nudity, swearing, violence, blood, adult situations....Roy and I are taking the girls to see Nemo today.  For a couple of "handicapped" kids, I have to proudly admit that they're better behaved at the theater than a lot of the "normal" kids.  Nat - the khaki is called desert camo.  Isn't our military creative?  Get yourself a disposable waterproof camera for the rafting trip.  I am soooo jealous.  It's been two years since we've had any kind of vacation.  It's pretty sad when you look forward to a weekly trip to the "big" city for groceries.  Take care, and Jan keep your head down and keep dodging those tornadoes.
