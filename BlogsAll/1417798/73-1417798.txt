Hi Gals, sounds like everyone here is having such a hard time at their respective jobs this week. I guess I can't complain too much, although I try. Actually at the hospital they are having to 'terminate' two pharmacists, that's never good. One of the ones they are going to let go NEVER does his share of the stuff, (he's the depressed-passive-aggressive-control freak I wrote about a while ago) so we're not really too upset, but then that makes me feel guilty that I'm not too upset.......viscious cycle....  Jen, I'm so glad to see your post....I hope everything is going as well as it possibly can...What you ate for a whole day, is not even a complete snack....:-) Oh well, you'll get the last laugh when you're a size three....Go easy on the narcotics....  PU-NO, he really needs to clean that desk of his.....I'll even volunteer to do it for him....Of course, maybe he is on vacation.... I need that many vacation days....:-P  It seems like everybody here is a writer or artist of some sort, you should all colaborate(sp) and write a book together, with this many screwed up minds, it's bound to be a best-seller  :-P....I actually had a teacher tell me I was a better editor than a writer, since I had no aspirations to be a writer, this didn't bother me at all. I can really see it though, as I read the paper, I tend to rewrite sentences and make them more precise, but, I couldn't come up with that sentence on my own....I guess that teacher was right...  I'm not real sure I like this new blog either, I don't have a scroll bar on the 'New Post' section, so it's hard to look back over what I wrote.
