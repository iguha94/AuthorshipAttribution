Just talked to my mom......my sister's going to NYC the weekend of Easter.  I'm sure anyone who reads this is thinking, "ok...*why* is this a big deal?".  The big deal is that her boyfriend moved there about a month or more ago-maybe 2 months? (I really need to get better about keeping track of stuff like this.)  The deal with him moving to NY was because he blew it and that would keep them apart.  Let's just say they are co-dependent, and it's *not* a *good* thing.  I keep meaning to write about this, but just haven't had the time because of work, and the emotional/mental overwhelming aspects of work and family issues (of which my sister is the 'key' issue).  All I'm going to say for now is that she is a recovering addict, and her boyfriend is still using (or was at the point when he left as he and my sister did 'one more' before he left).  Mom seems to think she'll be ok, that a mutual friend who is *not* a user (or so he says/mom believes) and that he will keep an eye on them.  He's not there to babysit though, and he's not going to be around all the time.  I just think it's a bad idea- I mean, hell's bells- she owes my mom money- prolly more than what she's (mom) told me.  AND nearly $25,000 in credit card bills.  I don't give a fat rat's ass if the airfare was only $250.  If you're broke- YOU'RE BROKE.  YOU DON'T GO SPENDING MONEY THAT YOU MORE OR LESS DO *NOT* HAVE, AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE RECOVERING- YOU *DON'T* GO TO VISIT A BOYFRIEND WHO IS *STILL* USING.  That's all I have to say about that for now.
