Jan- Bummer!  I was *really* hoping you would have received yours today!  Monday....maybe Monday.....LMAO, did he capitalize!  It was another warm day here- around 85+ today.  Better than it was, but I'd like to see it around 75.  The nights are cooler, at least!  It's 67 now- much easier to sleep in than 87!  Speaking of books......I just combined & have been editing some of my stories- on MS Word, it's about 72 pages right now.  Ouch.  I've never edited anything that big before- I think this is going to be a long but fun project.  That's not even all of my stories- just about half of them.  You know, I still have yet to read a book and put different images for the lead characters- of course, I'm still working on the book that I have as my "currently reading" on my favorites page on my site.  Oh well!  One of these days!  I tend to read 3 different books at once (I think this came up before too.....) and I'm able to keep them straight, no problem.  That sounds like an interesting series!  I'm going to have to take note of those.  I know what you're saying about Anthony Michael Hall- I can't believe how different he looks now!  I always think of him as the geek in 16 Candles (one of my favorite movies).  LOL about the RWS- that's why it takes me so long to get through books- I'm always thinking I'm going to read it wrong if I read too fast; I might miss something.    Jen- Sorry food commercials keep finding you!  Like Jan said, think of all that stuff as the pot of gold you'll find at the end of the rainbow.  Sounds like you're doing a lot better than before - that's great that you're up walking!  You *go* girl!
