Well lots has happened since my last blog.  You might be happy to know I have kicked my birthday blahs to the curb.  I took Brian to Christmaas that seemed to do the trick.  I am not sure if I will take him to the Lannan side for christmas day or not.  Haven't asked him.    Michael took Candy to Christmas.  That was pretty cool.  Afterwards Michael, Candy, Brian and Myself went over to Joyce to shoot some pool and then over to Chili's for desert.  I never thought in a hundred million years he'd be a public display of affection sort of guy.  He was like ALL over her it was awesome!  A little wierd cause I've never seen him like that but cool none the less.  Christmas shopping is no where near done. I'm gonna burn Brian a cd or two or three.  I burned my dad's yesterday.  I will attempt to burn Michael's today.  Not sure how I'm going to doall that just yet.    Jeff is in town, looking forward to seeing him.  Parts of me miss the normalicy of Michigan.  Other parts of me are sick of crying.  I wonder if now he's divorced I'd be as stressed as I was.    I do love Brian and I know Brian loves me but I hope to God I can put aside the fact that at one time I was addicted to Jeff, when I see him.  It will be an interesting challenge.  I am going thru the "I'm not calling Arlynd" phase.  I took him out of my cell phone.  I call Les instead.  My phone over here is being retarded.  It's not hanging up like it's supposed to and it's driving me insane.  If I get some money from mom and dad for christmas I'm buying a cordless.  My computer is up and running.  I have a nice motherboard and 1700 processor on it.  I think I am going to build me a new machine.  I have enought parts laying around except for a case and a cpu fan.  We have dsl but it's not downstairs yet.  Should be by the end of the year  .
