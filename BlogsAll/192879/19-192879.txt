Let's see... I was by myself on Friday... I hate being by myself EVER. Saturday sucked ass.  Arlynd was being a complete cock head.  Fucked Karen all night long then thought he was going to come downstairs at 9am and me be really happy about that.  So after careful consideration I've decided that Brian IS #1.  Now I just have to prove it.    I talked to Jeff for like an hour on Saturday.  I think he made me realize I'm not ok with consenual fucking unless I am in the picture with a bi female.  That's the ONLY part that i'm ok with.  As long as I can have as much fun as the man then I am ok.  Excluding me is not consenual.    Sunday I was just relaxed.  I had Brian over here.  We did a cuddle up and get comfortably numb evening.  We were in bed by like 7:30.  Got up about 11:00 ate and went back to bed.  Was very nice.  Today I deleted the midi background for you all. Worked on Mike's lap top AGAIN.  I can't seem to figure out why I have a hard drive one minute and reboot and i have no hard drive.. I can get msdos to load sometimes but then after a few reboots says i have no hard drive.  I am really quite irritated.  Called Arlynd about Tech support didn't want to answer the phone.    Talked to Karen for like an hour just now.  We discussed this weekend and I think over what happened.  She felt like she wasn't welcome here, and i had to clear things up.  I'm gonna help her with her pc if she can't get it up and running.  Talked to Scalet i think his hard drive is cashed.  Talked to Tama she failed her test.  Bill called need to call him back.  Brian is gonna want to go to Bill's and I want to go to the bar cause tama is tending bar.  So we'll see who wins.
