Katy - u have no reason 2 have low self esteem... u r a WONDERFUL PERSON!!!  i Love u!!!  i feel bad posting my probelems on u're blog, but i have no where else 2 put them & i trust u & i just don't feel like talking so imma write this all so u'll get it.   i dunno if i can do this.  any of this.  i am scared.  scared 4 my physical & mental health.  i know u're answer is gonna be 2 leave him, but i don't wanna do that & he doesnt want it 2 end either.  besides, if this ends all my faith in Love will be gone 4ever.  maybe that's why i was alone 4 so long?!  i dunno.  i feel like my problems don't matter.  he keeps talking about he respects my stuff.  i don't give a shit if anyone respects my stuff or not, i'd just like some respect 4 my feelings, u know?  & now there's another kid.  not mine, but another one.  which is fine, ok, it was b4 us, two years b4 us & i guess it's not definite.  i don't even know what i'm so fucking upset about.  i just know i'm shaking like Goddamn leaf & my heart is thumping & all i want is a fucking joint.  i wish i could marry Mary jane.  SHE never lets me down, never breaks my heart, never makes me cry.  i just feel so alone, so unwanted.  so confused 7 scared.  i'm going 2 my dad's 2night.  i'm gonna call rich.  i need a male opinion on this all & i trust his.  God, i trust his more than i've ever trusted anyone's opinion, no offense.  it's just u've been hurt oodles of times b4 & u're prolly right, it's better 2 just run off than risk being hurt again.  he's so fucking detatched from everything it's easy 2 take what he says 2 heart, i guess.  not that that makes any sense at all, or does it?  fuck.  i don't know what makes sense anymore.  i feel like i should go 2 the hospital.. i am not safe.  i am scared.  i am losing my mind.  & God, i hurt so fucking bad.  why does all this bullshit start after i get pregnat?  when my emoptions r fragile 2 begin with.  & he says HE"S stressed?!?!?  i'd like 2 see him try this all from my side.  i can see resonalby why he's stressed out - working 15-17 hours a day 7 days a week & then coming home 2 all these fish & having 2 keep them alive.  but Katy, i have a serious mental problem & it's really detrimental 2 my mental health 2 hear over & over that there is nothing wrong with me when it took me YEARS 2 accept the fact that there is.  no one is in my head but me.  NO ONE.  NO ONE CAN POSSIBLY KNOW OR UNDERSTAND EXCEPT ME!  & on top of this all he's making an uneducated assumption about it all.  i have asked him time & time again - put the fucking information right in front of his face about this diesease & yet he's never read it.  i cannot give an accurate, unbiased account of it all especially when my head is so damn jumbled 2begin wityh.  i should have never done this.  i should have stayed in my fucking room 7 never left it.  i should not subject myself 2 people.  i only bring ruin & destruction.  i am so scared.  so completely terrified of everythin g.  & how can he say he cares about me & the baby when all i've been getting lately is worry & stress from him?  doesn't he know that this kind of thing can cause a miscarriage?  i'm beginnign 2 think that's what he wants, though he says over & over that he all he wants is 2 be with me, get amrried & have a family.  but i really dont know if he can handle tis.  i dunno if i can.  i have 2 pee.  God, even that makes me cry.  do u know how terrified i am everytime i go 2 the bathroom that i'm going 2 be bleeding profusely? this is not good.  not good at all.  fuck i think he's home i Love u. {{{{{{{{{{{katy}}}}}}}}}}}}
