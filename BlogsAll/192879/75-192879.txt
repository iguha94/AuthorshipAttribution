woah.  it's like friday the 13th & stuff.  so i get this email from Sharon.  her & jessi broke up.  i'm assuming this is a recent development & that they will get back 2gether.  not that it has anything 2 do with me, it was just wierd 2 hear that.  called her @ work as soon as i got the email (which oddly was just as i was sitting down 2 the puter after a two hour read & a shower - oh & making a cup of 'cafe caramel', which btw, was one of a great number of coffee/latte/cappacino mixes half off at farmer crack's last night - is good shit i tell u!) but she was leaving, asked me 2 call her at some unfamilliar number in an hour or so.  so... i'll call her.  she always takes the time out 2 talk 2 me when i'm going through a big mess.  or should i say when i'm going through a big mess & reach out 2 someone.  it's funny cuz when we were 2gether i never used 2 open up 2 her, but now i feel like i can tell her anything, even things i don't tell other people.  there's some shit that's happened that only her & Rich know about.  no offense 2 anyone else, it's just, she knows me & how i am in a relationship, & has had more personal experience with my fucked up head than anyone else i know & then i needed a guys advice on things.  not that he ever gave me advice on the subject, but if it had been really bad i'm sure he woulda smacked me in the face with some testosterone-laced knowledge.  LOL.  sometimes it's funny 2 think of him as a guy.  he's not typical at all.  of anything.  ;oP  *sigh* hopefully 2night is better than last night where i felt like shit run over by a dump truck that had spilled decaying rot all upon me.  physically, i felt that way i mean.  other than that, things r going pretty peachy.    thank u & have a beautifully wonderful day
