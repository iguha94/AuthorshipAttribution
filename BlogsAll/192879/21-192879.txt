Ok Allie girl are ya happy?  Wednesday: We won at pool by a tie breaker game Arlyn won by 3 points Thursday:     Went to Duke's with David and Mike and Tommy                     Hey dave you're a light weight man Friday:          Ran some errands with Dave and Brian helped me and Dave move Dave's stuff in his new house Saturday:      Star gave me and eviction notice. Ate some bad soup (got food poisoning).  Went out with Ronnie, left early, went to                       bed, woke up about 1:30am puking and shitting uncontrolably (felt like a bad South Park episode) Sunday:        couldn't get out of bed.  David called me about 4:00pm and decided to tell me I WASN'T moving in and he was going to                     let Kyle move in instead. Mind you I've been hanging around David almost unseparably for like 2 weeks and I haven't met                     this guy, and now he's gonna move in.  I'm not happy! Monday:        woke up feeling MUCH better, just the sniffles  apartment hunted.  Now you know how shitty my week has been I'm gonna go crawl in a hole and stay there.  I'm not feeling well star is being a bitch.  She's really good at making me feel like i did something wrong.     Oh yeah   Allie's Blog
