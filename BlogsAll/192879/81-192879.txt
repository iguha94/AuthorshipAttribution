Well Monday me and unfucker came up with business cards got his printed up for now.  Mine will be printed once the ar is loading up rides.  They are really cool black background with white letters with instructions on the back.  I'm gonna be driving a sedan for a few weeks until we for sure are getting financed thru billy maize.  For those of you who don't know who billie maize is he owns vegas on the limos.  no limo in vegas runs without his name on it.  So anyway, Larry is trying to do all this himself.  I finally yelled at him and told him to stop working so hard let me help him.  Late nights and busy days on meds doens't work too well.. He didnt' look so hot the other day.  He's like the grandpa I never had it kills me that Ralphie is killng him when I can do somethign to stop it if he'd just let me.  I want him to retire in New mexico so he can get better.  This shit he's doing by staying up here in the humidity is literallyu killing him. All I want him to do is answer phones on the ocean docked somewhere SW.  He makes me laugh and he's a true friend.  No bullshit no games.  No empty promises.  I told him he had til April to get me in a car or I was going somewhere warm.  Well that was December when I also told everyone that life as we know it won't be the same after I moved out of jimmy's.  To all those who couldn't hold out for a year and decided to be a dick in the meantime, too bad so sad.  I told everyone if david didn't come thru on the farm and Larry didn't come thru with a limo thing by April the next lease was somewhere warm.  Well Larry put up.  The car is in Illinois it's plated and insured.  We need an insurance sticker and we will be rocking.  Larry's doing that right now. Except he JUST called me as i was blogging that saying that there's a problem with the vin number... God I hope everything just works right.  For once in my life I hope it works out right!
