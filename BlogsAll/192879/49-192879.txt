Well I finally got to talk to Zack.  Zack is Todd's best friend (another virgo).  Zack told me somethings that I am not sure are true or not.  The thoughts are nice though.  I'm not sure if he's telling me what he wants me to hear or not.  Something isn't adding up.  So I called Todd,  Todd: Hello Me: Hey Todd: Hey Me: whatcha up to Todd: getting ready to have some fun (enter girl's voice in the background) Me: well sorry for interrupting Todd: Ya I'm gonna let you go Me: Whatever (Click)  Dave was here he's like who the fuck was that? Todd.  What the ehll was that all about? I dunno he had some chick there so I hung up.  About an hour later Todd's cell calls the house.  So of course I answer "What?" It's Zack.  So we started talking about the fact that he's been an asshole since the night at the hotel with Gloria and Rob.  Zack admitted that was his doing.  He didn't want his best friend getting hurt.  He didn't know me from adam or eve.  After talking to Zack he promises to make it right again.  That boy was REALLY lucky I was too stoned to go anywhere.  I really miss Todd a lot.  I can't get that nigh tout of my head without something to replace it.  I don't really want to be WITH Todd.  Just so he's not giving em the silent treatment anymore would be nice.  That's what I told Zack.  So we shall see what happens.
