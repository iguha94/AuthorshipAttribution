So last night Glo dragged me to this 10 year class reunion icebreaker at sharky's. Everyone looks exatly the same for the most part.  Julie Russo was there was nice to see her, Ann Philyaw, Sean Gillette, Amy Jo Welzen, Bobby Jo Summers, and of course every snobby ass bitch that was in high school was there.  So me and Glo left about 10:30 and went to Joyce's.  She sat and talked to some guy for like 2 and a 1/2 hours Go Glo!!!!! I just sat back and enjoyed irritating Bonnie.  I thought maybe Justin would have showed up but never did.  I was really expecting him but it would have been nice.    Shopping list: An eletric coffee cup warmer so i can melt candles (idea from the unfucker) Bathroom towels a toilet bowl cover a rug for the toilet maybe a rug for the sink  I'm gonna attempt to put together brian's puter this weekend but have to stop over at fat danny's first and pick up his kick ass case.  I wanna finish up the cookies I started making yesterday  start a load of laundry over at mom's.  The cat's pissed on something in the bathroom so i have to wash EVERYthin and I had all my fabric stored in there so it's all gotta get washed.  Damn not being able to smell.. It's embarrassing.  I got the recipe from Joyce for apple shots.  So I alread made the apple juice. Now just gotta add the alcohol.. Maybe I'll call Candy and Mike go out for dinner with them if I have time.  I have to pick up a drill gun from mom and dad to make these really cool candle holders with tin cans i saw on while you were out. Maybe attemp to sand down my night stand.  We'll see
