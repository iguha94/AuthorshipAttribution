No limo yet I bought a parts car for $200 for my t bird!!! Yippe!!!!!!! Allison and Jim are in Jail down in Florida both had possession charges.  Her Brother Jake is helping her out but we all decided it's best to leave Jim there.  Jake said Allison should be out by monday. I'm down to 160 lbs!!!!!!!!!!! 10 lbs to go! ummmmmmmmmm Not much else really going on.  Carl's been a complete dick.  I hope one o these days he'll sit back and realize what he had going on here and remember what it was like and dream about what it could be like.  but if that doesn't happen and he just fades that's ok too.  i'm so hurt by the way he talks to me i can't stand it. So instead of getting al depressed about it I'm just gonna put my head back in to money so i don't think about him.  oh I have this awesome idea for ebay! I want to first sell off the parts of my tbird. THEN...........  I'm going to start a drive away company on ebay list it as a service.Starting bid of $500 I will drive your car from chicago land area anywhere in the US. 5 day guarantee delivery.  THEN if that takes off up the starting bid to $800 and include canada.  Now I fly back hop flights on teh way back and recieve a free airline voucher.  So lets say i win a car on ebay I can fly down for free and pick it up.  Drive it back.  Put it back up on ebay after a $200 maccoo paint job and resell it with DELIVERY avail.  No one on ebay sells cars with delivery avail.  So anyway that's teh game plan.  Gotta wait til monday to call a few drive away companies and see what they charge the customer.  If i sell it as a SERVICE on ebay i think it will REALLY take off.  Doesn't hurt to try!  I am adding a team blog for my mp3 groupies.  I'm hopin to have a little fun with it.
