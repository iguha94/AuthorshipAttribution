am here... & alive. just feel like so much nothing lately. it'll change though, it always does, doesn't it? stupid bitch caseworker won't send me my damn medicaid card so i haven't any proof of insurance which is about as good as having none at all. isn't that nice of her? must be awesome 2 have her job - doing jack shit 4 everyone on her caseload & getting paid 4 it.  keep trying 2 force myself 2 be more social... call this person & that but i have nothing of importance 2 say xcept how fucked in the head i feel & no one wants 2 hear that - not even me, un4tunately u can't escape u'reself no matter how far u run so i get 2 listen 2 the neverending newsreel of Allegra's Strange World 24 hours a day. lucky me.  other than that nothing has changed. money's tight cuz alan's place of employment is full of idiotic morons with no common sense who don't know how 2 efficiently run a company therefore making thier employees slave away at 70-80 hours a week 4 months on end & then all of a sudden cutting them below 40 only 2 have a plant full of jackasses wandering around 4 a month with absolutely nothing 2 do. he's going more crazy sitting in that office each day with nothing 2 do but twiddle his thumbs than when he was working himself sick with double the hours anyone should have. we'll make it though. internet is still on so everythng is cool.  i've been attempting drawing again but i can only do it in short spurts & it really sucks ass cuz half the time i cannot concentrate on reading but managed 2 get through White Oleander AGAIN last week & am working on The Bell Jar once more right now.  see why i don't post? nothing but boring muck 2 write about.  i miss u Katy & i Love u & i still pop by here at least everyother day 2 check up on u.  {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{Katy}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}
