Ok incase anyone misse it My dad (Mr. Cleaver) had a mild heart attack while on a cruize in the Bahamas and was air lifted to Clevland Heart hospital in Ft. Lauderdale ($7100 later).  Mr. and Mrs. Cleaver are doing good.  I went down to Florida orginally to meet up with David and just so happened that my dad was having chest pains all at the same time.  So turned it in to a rea long few days but all is well.  We got back Friday and I've pretty much been recouping ever since.  I got some really nice dank from the band kids and some hash to go with it.  Going to mom and dad's for dinner.  Then I plan on staying home and getting completely fucked up because I can!  It's been an excrutiating long week.  I could sit here and rant and rave about the floridiots, or bitch about how stupid brian really is, but i'm just not in the mood.  Trying to get some good energy back in to the house.  I need to ground myself for a little bit and just relax.  A whole shit load of new poems were written and posted.  check out the archives for older stuff if you get bored.  Next weekend David and I are going to toronto.  That should be fun.  Allison's hubby says we can get seeds up there.  Better believe it!  Hugs n stuff love you guys great big huge huge huge bunches.
