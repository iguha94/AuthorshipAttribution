Friday, umm what did i do friday?  Funny musta got stoned and forgot LOL.  Oh Glor stopped by with the kids early afternoon and then Jerrylyn stopped by for a sec.  Oh then it started storming out really bad like LATE Friday night.  So for old times sake me and Brian went down by the lake over by Frigate's and sat and watched this awesome storm roll in.  the rain missed us so we got the most beautiful lightning storm.  It was quite poetic.  I wrote a poem about it i'll post it if i can find it.  Poor Linda, I feel so bad for her.  Chris was at Star's house until at least midnight on Friday.  He had the balls to bring Star by the house to bring her some vicodin.  Chris hasn't charged Star any money.  Linda is furious.  Saturday Me, Brian and David went to Great America and then ordered up some Za.  Mike and Candy swung by.  Tama and Bill stopped by about midnightish.    I guess you should all know that Kelly was admitted to the psych ward.  Not sure if she's out or what.  I hope she gets the help she needs.  Sunday, Brian got off work then went to my mom's and started dinner.  I brought laundry over and got that started.  He made the most wonderful lasagne I think I've ever had.  Candy made a red velvet cake that was to die for.  I got my mom a low rise bird bath and a small statue for her garden.  Mike is working on putting a glass top on my mom's old sewing machine table.  My dad wrote my mother a really mushy letter it was so sweet!  Brian and I left there and went to Kmart to get an all in one remote, smoked a little and now I'm heading to bed.  Love you guys!
