Went to the farm.  We got this huge ass light to play "spotlight on deer".   We took down the paintball field, cut a small trail from the farm yard to the paintball field area and gonna put up a blind there for "sightseers".  Went to a really dumb antique appraisal.  Went to the casino.  Ok as if that wasn't enough.    My p.c. crashed on Friday.  So Boy is gonna bring over a hard drive and see if that's it or if it's the motherboard.   Gloria's talent thing is tonight.  So it's a toss up between blowing off Gloria, hanging out with Brian, Bill and a guy named Todd, or heading over to Joyce's.  Guess it all depends on if Boy is coming over otnight or tomorrow.  Ok, you men say us women are hard to figure out.  You say go when you mean stay. You say never when you mean right now. You say you dont have time while you are dawdling to leave.  When I asked you why you touch me one way and talk another, your answer was I dont know. Is that a defense mechanism or a game? I guess Im just not sure what I am to you, so the questions run through my head.  The girls say hes just a boy he doesnt know what he wants But when I ask a mans opinion he says go with the touch. The touch says yes.  The shell says no.  I dont get it. Why are you so afraid to talk to me?  Have I hurt you before?  The women say that guys just dont know how to talk to anyone. The guys say that as soon as a guy admits how he feels about someone it goes to shit. Is that what is going on?  Worried if you say something its gonna go to shit?  God I wish youd just tell me where I stand before its too late once again
