Followed by a call from Carl. Followed by a call from Ryan and Followed by a call from linda Followed by a call from Cathy.  she's going in for MRI regarding her ms so I hope everyone keeps her in thier prayers.  I still haven't heard from the bank if I got my loan or not and unfucker isn't answering his phone.  My house is freezing and it's fucking MAY.  I spent the late evening with Brian last night with a late night call from my new online fling in australia for like 45 minutes.  She's gonna put me in the poor house but I'm a sucker for that Aussie accent.   order of life events and just try to stop me  Limos up and running and at least one car paid off by 4th of july. Garage by 4th of July Gloria moved out by the time school starts. The theater by the school start of next year so by next like August. The stretch paid off by that christmas or whatever vehicle I will be in.  Trade all that shit in for a new stretch and a new navigator Send Larry down to vegas for retirement Take over the biz.
