{{{{{{{{Katy}}}}}}}}}}   i'm alive & ok.  i've just been so fucking tired lately i haven't even been using the puter.  hell, i don't even know if i can get on messenger now... last night alan resetup his puter (the registration time expired again - go figure... u know it's almost worth $150 2 get rid of the frustration of doing this every 30 days ;oP) & when he tried 2 get back on yahoo he discovered our firewalls r so thick, heavy, & well constructed it wouldn't let him connect.  he tried msn (though why anyone would use THAT is beyond me) & got the same thing.  i know it's prolly just a configuration thing he didn't have time 2 solve... but God damn.  it's supposed 2 keep idiots out, not us from getting IN.    this made me laugh, though: 'Allie have you like gone mental?' LOL!!!  gone?!?!?  darling, i live there ;oP no seriously.  if ever i get a fucking medicaid card so i can use the damn insurance (sure - accept me 4 full coverage but neglect 2 give me the card so it doesn't make any difference anyway) i'm going straight 2 a shrink.  any shrink.  most of them r oblivious anyway so it's a damn good thing i've done so much research on this dragon that chases me.   i  know what kind of meds i need, so it doesn't really matter that most shrinks haven't a clue.  it's not that i'm suicidal again, or ragingly manic (though a little mania would be nice - perhaps something would affect me then), & certainly not psychotic (knock on wood), i'm just completely disaffected.  my senses r depressed.  nothing stimulates me.  it's like i can see the inspiration in some things but i just can't GET 2 it - if that makes any sense.  2 put it in another way - i'm intillectually depressed - which in turn is just fucking depressing the hell out of me in general.  i look at alan as he gets excited over the smallest thing & i'm fucking JEALOUS!!!  it's like i remember when i was like that - remember when i could find AND feel the inspiration in somethng as trivial as dirt or a pile of shit (or as i did once, in vomitting up my lunch) - & i just wanna crawl in a hole & die.  i'm creatively malnourished & it's slowly killing me.  something in my brain is obviously not being produced, or being over-produced & it's making me numb 2 every & anything.  it really fucking sucks ass.  so...  not only 2 be responsible (& 2 get myself 2 a point where i can function as at least half a normal person so i can take care of this child when it's born), but also 2 feel again i'm going 2 go back & get on some medication & this time i'm not gonna be stupid & stop when i'm feeling better or just plain frustrated with the whole thing.  who knows, maybe i'll find someone REALLY stupid & they won't make me go 2 therapy 2 supplement the medication.  therapy is SO FUCKING pointless 4 someone who's sole mental problems lie in chemical misfires of the brain.  i mean what r they gonna do, talk my brain in2 working right?!?!?  SHeeSH.  anyway, imma shut up now, i've gotta clean.  my cousin SAYS she's coming over, i need 2 shower & it's already 2pm.  i Love u darling & hope u're doing well.  even though i havent been on the puter much i still check in here ever few days 2 make sure u're ok.  {{{{{Katy}}}}}}
