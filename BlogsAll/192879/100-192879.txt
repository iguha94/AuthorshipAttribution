Steve is out of town til like Tuesday so is Jeremy. Evil's hanging around tho and it's all gewd... Steve and I had a really long talk on Friday and i think him and I are going to be just fine. Every once in a while you have to take a step back and realize what gewd stuff you have around you instead of the bad all the time.  Jeremy: You've been a GEWD friend! Been my rock when I needed it and my voice of reason through it all. For that alone I thank God you're in my life  Michel: Thank you for everything. Thank you for just being you and not listening to everyone else. Thank you for having a mind of your own and speaking it even when it's not easy. I know when you're around I'm at ease, unless yer kik bannin ppl LOLOL.... Anyway, thanks for filtering out the bullshit and realing that online drama doesn't mean much of anything. We're still friends no mater what happens online and THAT's what's important. Just thanks for being you.  Steve: I don't even know where to start... I guess i should first start off by thanking you for coming back in my life. It seems we find each other when we need each other the most. That's all that's really important. I have one of the coolest friends one could hope for. I feel safe when you're here and lonely when you're not. I missed you in my life very much and I'm glad I'm a part of your life again. By the way I found logs you told me you were 21 when we first started talking and that's like WAY NOT you were more like 19 :P FYI... Do the math... ANYWAY.... Thanks for trusting me like you do. Means alot!
