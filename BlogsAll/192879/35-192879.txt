You know today was one of those days  If it could go wrong it did but somehow all worked out for the better of everyone.  Started out by Larry calling me about a script.  After HOURS of fucking around with it we have a working script.    Rachel came over and I died her hair she took a shower, lent me some money and left.  We had a miscommunication with Doug about a time frame issue so Texas didn't happen.  That forced me to make a few phone calls and FINALLY Edder pulls thru and finds me some kick ass stuff.  I mean 3 hits fucked up stuff.  Absolutely impressive.  It's a strand of white widow I believe.        So we were out in Gurnee to pick that up and we had to run to David's to pick up a 98 SE disk from greg.  So we stopped by at a friend's house in Island Lake.  Let him have some.  That was the true confession of how awesome this stuff was he smelled it as I walked in.  We went grocery shopping came home started trying to fix Brian's puter and was unsuccessful.  I started backing up my full collections of artists.  If they weren't full they were gone.  I was almost in tears.  I hate having to reformat.  I'm gonna reformat and put 98 back on here i'm so sick of the load up time and shut down time i could scream.  Anyway, Brian made some chili and mac n cheese.  So ther is fresh Chili in the house.. I don't want anyone yelling at me that they didn't know.  Bill stopped by and jerimiah earlier in the day.    I watched a new clean sweep and a new trading spaces and both episodes TOTALLY rocked.  That chick from the changing spaces on BBCA was on my god is she fucking hotter then hell in july!  Anyway, They did this totally kick ass thing with the ceiling that I will do in my house but kick it up a notch. The walls were a eggplant purple witha goldish looking ceiling.  The WALL color went up to the top of the walls and on to the ceiling by like a foot leaving the rest of the ceiling open and gold.  I was so blown away by how taller it made the room look that i decided to do the same thing but instead of just a foot out and leaving the rest blank I'm gonna do every other foot in squares in green so the trim will be green and 1 foot of green the next will be white square then a green square.  THEN do squiggly lines in the middle. That will be a 3d effect. The green border of the squiggly lines will have glowy stars.  What do you think of them apples?  I went and saw tony on saturday OMG he is hotter then hell in june and july combined!  He's mine Glor sorry I waited 25 years for him u can't have him!  Saw Stephy and Kath Saturday too.  Surrounded by awesome looking people I love my life right now.  So things didn't workout QUITE like i wanted them too but they worked out!  Oh yeah and had another mind blowing sexual tension releaser with brian and you guy wonder why I keep him around..
