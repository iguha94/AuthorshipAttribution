So my pipes are either froze or clogged.  Since YESTERDAY!  So he gets off work and calls   Brian:do u need anything.   Me: I have no kitchen sink Brian: I'll bring some drano.  Mind you he was at his parents house ALL night so bumbass me ASSUMES he would bring a little space heater.  He stops at Jimmy's and comes home instead of giong to my parents house where there IS a space heater, or his parents that has a space heater.  He came home last night WITHOUT a space heater to drop off clothes and pick up his work shirt.  Comes home from work WITHOUT a space heater and a sink full of water.  Instead of manually draining out the sink, he pours a half a bottle of drano in the sink.  Hello ,water, sink, no air cirulation.  So before he leaves instead of getting the access water out of the sink he pours the OTHER half of the bootle in.  I discovered this AFTER i spent na hour getting water out of the sink.  So I call him.  Me: Do you think maybe it wasn't working the first time u put the drano in? Bri: well it started to go down some. Me: no dumbass it didn't Bri: well it looked like it to me Me: why did you pour in the other half in a frozen fucking sink Bri: I'll fix it tomorrow Me: Brian I have no kitchen sink.  I would have had a kitchen sink last night If you would have brought me over a space heater.  Bri:  It's froze on the outside Me: it's frozen on teh inside too  And then people wonder why I am post poning the wedding.  I am so irritated!
