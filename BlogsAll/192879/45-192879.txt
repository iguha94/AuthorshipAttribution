Ok hopefully tonight i will set up a new and improved tagboard on my page and Tony's.  I'm just very relived today Brian got a call back from Bill's.  Hopefully he starts on Tuesday.  We went and pick up aps today and fixed his resume.  Rachel's here been since school let out today.  Brian is rolling up J's so I don't have to.  Then WE are filling out aps.  Today we went and dropped off his resume to the places that he has all ready put in applications.  Picked up new ones for both of us.  Updated my rusume a little.  I actually got brian to brush his teeth.. That was a task.  We are gonna go over to Wal-mart and Walgreens tonight.  He needs a real job and so do i i know this.  I just don't want to have to work and i don't have to work if he brings in the rent money a month.  i got so stressed out over it i went off on my mom and candy about it yesterday.  Just broke down.  Can't handle it any more. I told brian that and i think he FINALLY understands why we are in the predictament we are in.  I can't handle the lying about jobs anymore.    Anyway on  a happier note.. Gloria is gonna go see Bob.  That will just toally rock! I am so happy she is doing something for herself for the first time in a long time.  4 years to be exact. LOL Anyway, love ya glor... EVERYTHING happens for a reason!
