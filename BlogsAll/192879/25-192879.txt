Ok I have a new house number so anyone interested should call me on the cell to get it.    I was listening to the radio the other day and an interesting question was brought to mind.  Now that we are adults what should we know how to do but just can't figure it out.  I called the radio station on this one and told them I am TV challenged.  I can figure out how to hook up the VCR to the tv or just one component to the tv but if it's more than one component I'm totally lost.  Then trying to find ONE all in one remote that operates EVERYTHING is a whole differnet challenge.  I saw Ronnie Wednesday night.  That made my week.  Something about that girl drives me insane.  I took 15 points in pool Wednesday.  I hung out with Dave and Gloria last night we went to Dave and Buster's down in Lombard to meet up with cher. I hope she comes and sees me today.  My gut feeling tells me she's going to blow me off.  She was being SOOOOOOOO cute.  Should have seen the outfit she had on.  a CUTE little plaid skirt and a really cute black top with patten leather shoes.  YUM!!! I so badly wanted to kidnap her and bring her home with me.  Then we went to Sheridan News so Dave and I could buy a new bong.  Then ended up at Tobin's before we took her home.  oh yeah and Dial up sucks balls.  Just for the record.    I think Allie and I are going to make a team blog.  Anyone interested should   Email me
