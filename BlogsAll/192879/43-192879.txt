promised myself i'd do this 2day.  had wonderful insight on everything last night & of course now that i'm actually in front of the puter it all seems dull.  everything.  gimmie a few minutes while this THC makes it's way through my system & hopefully i'll be able 2 see in colors again.  Katy, i just realized that when i emailed u a few minutes ago i4got 2 include the link 2 the site i was talking about.  http://gogags.blogspot.com/ .   i got stoned & 4got.   & what kinda shit is this that u've pulled: saying u're gonna be in a poker tournament & not giving us u're results immediately.  SHeeSH.  how rude!!!  ;oP  i find it rather ironic that i should find that 'no more fish' message on the tagboard as Alan came home with 5 bettas on friday night.  Apparently het hought it was ok cuz they r 4 me, not him.  WHY DOES HE NOT UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  DOG  &  FISH ????  i said DOG..... DOOOOOOGGGG , not Fish....  DDDDDdddddOOOOOOooooGGGGggggggggggg !!!  if he buys me something that has anything 2 do with fish or aqariums, or even water 4 that matter i am pouring bleach in these tanks.  i swear 2 Heaven that i will do it! hmmnn.... or maybe i can just give him a bunch of Tori Amos & Sarah McLachlan cd's.  that might even get the picture across better.    my dad's gone 4 his stress test 2day.  i hate this.  i really really hate this. i also hate my head.    My head has performed an illegal operation & must shut down.  u will lose all unsaved information.
