Katy, i Love u darling & wanted 2 say this, even though it might be plainly obvious 2 u...  i still think things like this r good 2 hear regardless:  4 one thing u seem more grounded 2 me than u ever have been b4.  i'm talking about in the last few months, perhaps a little longer.  it seems like u're finally getting u're life straightened out & i am proud of u.  i don't give a shit what *some* people say, what u r doing is good 4 u & bad in no way shape or form.  i wish u nothing but the best - i pray u're dad can see u're serious about the ventures u wish 2 delve in2 cuz although some of u're ideas have been a little fruity i honestly believe u r on the right track now.  it's more the way u're attitude & views on everything have changed than anything else.  keep the faith, u're sense of humour (yeah like u could EVER get rid of that... u could send it express 2 egypt & it'd be knocking on u're door in the morning ;oD), & belief in u'reself & nothing but good will come 2 u.  i don't know what i would have done without u through so much shit it's unreal.  i Love u 4ever, darling.  smoochies ;oD  ps... yeah yeah...  happy new year 2 u guys 2 ;o/
