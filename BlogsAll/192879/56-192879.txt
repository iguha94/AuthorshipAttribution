     wow.  that's kinda messed up, but i guess i can see the point if he's just worried u're gonna get caught doing it.  other than that - IT'S MARIJUANA 4 FUCKING CHRIST'S SAKE!!!  perhaps u should point out that in some places (like where i am) people can drive a half hour & smoke the shit LEGALLY (as it was meant 2 be).  it's not like u're selling things that can kill anyone.  *sigh*  {{{{{{{Katy}}}}}}}}  alan says he's gonna get us some white widow seeds from some other continent so we can grow when we move.        all them things u said about virgos...  it's funny.  he IS very jealous without telling me so & has an insane sense of humour that i'm not quite 100% sure he uses 2 exactly throw himself in2 the center of attention, but he does use it 2 try & get & keep my attention.  which is cool, but not when i'm reading ;oP.  other than that he tells me he Loves me all the time, but it took a whole hellova lot 2 get 2 i'm sorry.  like, me saying, 'ok then, i'm leaving',  & then getting 90% of my shit out of the house.  just sat there & looked at me like his whole world was crashing down.    other than all that, i can understand u're need 2 feel secure in the world, or in the little world u & brian have made with each other, but i think more importantly u should feel emotionally & spiritually satisfied in the relationship.  it's silly of me 2 think that u'd overlook that, i just want 2 see u that way more than anything & had 2 point in out just in case u're so frustrated with not being financially ok those things took a backseat.  basically, i think u can get through tough times with money & keep u're Love & relationship strong as long as u're emotionally & spiritually sound with each other.  then again, i don't have 2 worry about that kind of thing, so it's kinda pretentious 4 me 2 say.  u know i don't mean 2 offend u.  i just don't wanna see u say, 'ok, he's supporting us now, he can have me' & then realize a month later u feel empty with him.  i Love u, Katy, even if i DIDN'T call u last night.  i'm willing 2 bet $1000 that once i get on some damn lithium i'll be much more social.  & then after the baby is born, when i get on the rest of the stuff i need, i might actually be pleasent 2 hang out with & talk 2.  i don't wanna subject anyone 2 this horrid depression plagued with the occasion wild, intense UP & DOWN i've been experiencing, so i've been staying away from everyone.  i don't think it's fair that anyone have 2 deal with it.  funny, though, somehow i feel it's fair that i have 2.
