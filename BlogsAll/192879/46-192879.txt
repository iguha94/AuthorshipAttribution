My morning started out by puking at 5am.. I was laying in bed and was afraid to cough knowing I would puke  what a horrible feeling... Followed by chrissy calling at 10am.  Well last night Brian and I started arguing over money and that I refuse to pull money out of my 401.  This fight all started because he made a HUGE production out of loosing $20.  I am TIRED of living like this!  This week is job hunting week for me and if I find a job before he does he's done!  I am mentally EXHAUSTED!  David and I are going out tonight.  I can't stand to be around Brian another night.  I will seriously flip a lid.  I am so stressed out that I can't even think straight anymore.  I need a night OUT!  I'm gonna finish smoking this bowl.. Call Ruben.  Eat some Mac and cheese.  Go to mom's work on brings quilt.  Go to this damn tree lighting ceremony.  Then go deal with eder and any business then go out.  I guess I should get used to doing all this running around myself.  I've been pretty spoiled as far as I don't have to do anything.  Anyways, hopefully I'll be able to get a pack of "cigarettes" rolled since I have only been asking him to do this for like ever.  That way we can keep track of how many we sell a little easier.  Ok I'm done babbling
