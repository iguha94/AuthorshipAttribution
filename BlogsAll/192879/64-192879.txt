So I don't have to keep repeating myself.......  Talked to the mother of Brian's child (as we like to call her)... Called about claiming Steven on taxes. This was my chance to talk to her aout a whole lot of other issues too and try to get her point of view on stuff.. It wasn't too bad of a talk but some decisions were made that I'm sure Brian will be happy with. She is letting us claim Steve so we can move out of here and move in to at least a two bedroom... She thought that I didn't liek Steven.. That's not even a thought in my head. I just have no where to put him.. Now that she understands that I told her as long as we can get steven in a two bedroom we have no problems taking him on weekends.. The problem is that Brian gets stuck over there works his ass off nothing comes off for the car in the process.. So LAST year we could hae been in a bigger place by now if she let us claim him. Now that she really gets the whole picture she's gonna let us claim steven.  On a side note Venice (Bill and Todd's mom) is FINALLY divorced! WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO! Now thier lives can start. Brian will be happy to hear that when he gets home..  Brian got hired in over at Kmart.. Bill's mom is divorced. I talked to Chrissy.. So far it's a win win, Minus the whole Jim getting upset thing.
