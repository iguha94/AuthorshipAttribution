Well, I thought the radio situation was taken care of but apparently not.  Larry is having breakfast with Peil about adding my nextel phone to his package  .  Tuesday is THE day. Larry faxed over the PNL for the last 3 years.  The accountant is on his way down to Kansas to sit and talk corporate numbers with these assholes.  We have the Las Vegas guy as a back up cosigner if we need to.  My mother still doesn't understand how I'm going to make any money.  She won't understand it because it's not a 9 to 5 job.  She won't understnad that this is the only thing that I have a reputation in I might as well put it to use.  She does understand that I am not talking off the top of my head she just always sees things as falling apart because I touch them.   Heavy is the head that wears the crown  I'd Love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down.  You don't understand what I'm attempting to explain. because you know it all and things will never change. - Limp Bizkit  I emailed Larry off the idea about getting house accounts that pay once a month on thier credit card.  So we have 2 separat days one pay day is on the 15th the other is on the 1st some will be due on one day while others are due on another.  Every 10th ride is free to house account clients.  For every house account some one brings us it's a free ride either off thier bill or for future use.  Very simple.  I think he will understnad the concept.  I hope u can teach an old dog new tricks.
