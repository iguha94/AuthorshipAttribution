The web address will no longer post to aranetta.blogspot.com.  There is a new address to go to.  Also new addresses for all the poetry and Lyrics also.  Everything else remains the same.  After you get done posting view blog.  Then save that address as the new blog address.  Some might ask why I would do that.  Well I'm gonna fill you all in.  I've realized over the years people have nothing better to do than to read thru old archives.  I am not sure why my ex boyfriends or ex best friends would care about something I said over a few years but what ever.  I am doing this so they can end a chapter in thier lives and loose what's so important to them.  They seem to think they still have some control over my life if they know my daily routine and habits.  So instead of letting them still hold on to something they screwed up I am changing addresses.  That's all there is to it.  I don't need them coming back in to my life because of something I said in a personal blog.  SO in order to stop this from continuously happening I am ending this address as of right now.  I can not believe that all you men out there really have nothing better to do then to read my blog still trying to hold on to some part of my life because you are pissed off at yourself that you screwed up.  There are more than 2 of you doing it to yourselves.   I really don't get that. I mean why would you read my blog months later after you fuck up.  Instead of just calling and apologizing or admitting you miss me.  You drive yourself crazy reading way too much in to things I say on my journal.  If you don't like what's being typed about they you can leave.  But seeing as how you just must read it I'm doing you a favor by changing the address.  If you would like a link to the new site please email aranetta@yahoo.com.  If I'm not wanting you in my life you'll know.
