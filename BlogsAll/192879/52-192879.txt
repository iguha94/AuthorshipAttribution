Well we buried Brian's grandma today.  Just when I thought I was done burying grandparents.  Travis goes over by Laurie and says where's grandma, as we are at the cemetary.  He said that Laurie started crying.  Kevin almost started i'm like come on don't do this to me Kev.. I'm trying to keep Larry sr, jr, Brian, mom and myself together.. Don't you start.  Service was nice and short the burial was even faster due to the bitter cold.  So now it's time to unwind, unstress, and wait to hear if we can move in to grandma's house.  All the same time, I just had a 4 hour conversation with david last night about post poning the wedding. His mom just asked me if I wanted grandma's wedding ring.  Now I'm thinking about my grandma's jewelery AGAIN.  I really need to push the wedding back some.  I know everyone that is close to me will understand.  Those that will get mad about it.  That's just too darn bad.  I want to make sure we are doing this because we are ready.  Not just because everyone expects us to be.  Carl did call today while I was at the funeral.  Was a huge help.  I just don't think he realizes how much that little stuff means to me.  It's all about little stuff, but then we are told not to sweat the little stuff.  So I'm not gonna sweat me and carl.  I really want him a part of my life and if I'm in his ace all the time I'm gonna push him away.. That's the last thing I need right now.
