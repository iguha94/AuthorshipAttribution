Brian was very sweet.  I think he is FINALLY starting toget it.  He helped me out so much today.  Made my mom lasagna for dinner.  Empty out the cat litter.  made my bed with fresh sheets and fixed the leaking aircondioner.  Mike and I gave her a car detailing at Libertyville auto spa which is on her way to work.  Brian made dinner and dessert.  I did dishes.  Candy talked about her work.  The WHOLE fucking dinner AGAIN!  So once again i didn't get to tell my mom my whole plan because she won't undersand it anyway.  Candy interrupted me twice she was talking to my dad i was talking to my mom and he was like excuse me she's talking.. I'm like ya and? I was talking to mom.  He just gave me a look I got up from the table.  Walked downstairs and took a deep breath and relaxe before i killed someone.  Oh ya now I remember why I don't live with my parents.  They drive me insane.  Then brian and I went down to Kev's then home.  Ryan and Michelle came over we sat outside on the deck and smoked a few bowls in the new bong we got. Aunt Michelle (Toby and Bruizer's Aunt) Is home! she's come home to stay!  She's not leaving no more! YAY SUSHI!!!!!!!  Ok sorry had to get that out of my system.  Kicked the boys and girls out.  Scipted my IRC stuff so I feel like a total nerd cause I still know how to do all that stuff.  I gotta email Gloria A bunch of pics I took of her and britt and brandon.  That was aweome day.  Anyhow, funny how when you get older you realize that sometimes a quiet day with your best friend and her kids puts it all in perspective.  sighssss!!!
