I feel like I just talk to everyone all the time now so I don't blog as often as usual.  Carl is moving back to San Diego a lot sooner than I had hoped.  I put him in hisplace about alot of things like him being so preoccupied on the phone that I don't even exist.  I yelled at him about not givign me a half hour's notice before he shows up ehre so I have time to make it back from Round Lake or Algonquin if I have to. Spend the night so I knoweverything's all right.  He did admit to me that I'm the only one he's fucking.  We got a lot of things squared away.  Ed.  Well he's a work of art.  He text messages so sweet then just does empty promises.  It's rather heart wrenching.  I wish he'd just stop.  I'll telli carl to fuck off if he'd just stop being so distant.  Arlyn.  Not talking to him anymore haven't since I brought Ed home.  Laura.  WE are taking things slow.  I am not going to loose her again.  Limo stuff.  FINAL meeting is Tuesday I guess.  Working with Dad.  It's going rather smoothly.  A lot smoother than I thought.  Gloria.  We had a really nice night on Friday.  The kids were really good.  She had a chance to go out have a good time and not have to worry about steve and the kids.  She was all mellow yesterday and probably today too since I haven't heard from her.  Online.  My online life is settling back down to a normal living status.  Got rid of some dead weight on that end.  Kept some good friends and just mellowed back out..   Text messaging is a wonderful thing.!
