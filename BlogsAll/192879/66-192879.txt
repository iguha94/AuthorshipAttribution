{{{{{{{{{{{{katy}}}}}}}}}}}}  God, i have like ZERO energy.  i'm sick inside.  i guess everything is ok here again, but everything is NOT ok in my head.  i think it's trying 2 kill me again.  everything i look at provokes the question:   could this kill me?   we need 2 get rid of that damn gas oven.  like 2day.    i've made the decision (or rather, my head had made it 4 me, being so fucking unstable i'm like a teenager who's whole world has left her - & we all know how unreasonable teenagers r) that i must go 2 the shrink & get some damn lithium.  they say it's perfectly safe, which is probably not 100% true, but the fact is they've been studying this drug since the 50's, & i myself am not safe in this body, with this head, with these misfiring chemicals.  it's like i will never get out of this one.  like this is the big one, the one that's gonna do me in.  i know it was only made worse by certain events, but the point is i've been slowly inching my way toward complete inability 2 function 4 a few weeks now.  like they say, the risks from the drug r FAR less than the risks from the disease.  i was stupid 2 think, when i first found out that it would just pass over me, that the hormonal changes would not kick my ass in2 the ground in it's beligerant attempt 2 kill me once more.  i was stupid 2 disregard that i'd been feeling this way 4 awhile b4 i found it.    why have i been given this head?  why can't i look at anything & not think of how it could kill me?  why am i so fucking scared 2 even go 2 the bathroom?  i can't stand this anymore & i sure as hell cannot stand myself.
