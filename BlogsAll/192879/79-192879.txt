Gloria showed up nice and early! That was so cool!  I'm so glad she came over.  Really that was so much fun.. "Do I bitch?"  She actually asked me that with a straight face after David got done bitching about Brian.  I"m like hey now I bitch about Steve as much as David bitches about Brian.  She actually asked me "do I bitch?"  I laughed so hard I about peed my pants.  Ryan was here giving a play by play on the cats fucking.  I called david about 6:00 talked to him he told me to call the lady about the house.  Old lady:Hello Me: Well hi there how are you? Old Lady:  I'm good oh I thought you were my girlfriend Me:  Well I could be if you let me move in. Old Lady: Ok you got the house.  I was worried about the cats Me:  I swear on my grandmother's grave you won't be disappointed.  then we agreed on the money and everything... So it's mine!  I can't remember the order, but Chantel stoped by.  So nice to see her.  Marla came over Jeff met us over at marla's to fix some eletrical shit in the kitchen.  Then we came back here talked for a little while.  Hector showed up and left Jeff left about 10.  Been a nice quiet no Brian sort of night.  Sent him up to Bill's he needed the road trip.  The bird will be flying Saturday.  I don't care how but it will be up and running.  Talked to Eric.. He's so fucking funny I swear to God.  The best news of the day.. Kat got married to that Logan guy last week.  So i called David about 1:30 to tell him.. He wasn't thrilled but at the same time he was laffing too.  Anyway, just got done talking to Michelle online so I'm going to attempt to go get some sleep waiting for these pm's to kick in.  Laffed myself in to a headache with the whole Kat thing.  I think I might lock the cats up so I get a good night's sleep.  I'm gonna need it!  Tomorrow is packing day.
