I just wanted to apologize to anyone that had to deal with me this afternoon.  It was just one of those days that I wanted to crawl back in to bed and pretend it was all a bad dream.  To catch you all up... Carl is moving and i'm not really thrilled about it.  I knew it was eventually goign to happen... dave's reaction "he's probably going to move in with his other fuck"  Like I needed to hear that... What the fuck ever!  Stupid humor of the day... this is why I love my brother so much Cadman316 (11:31:52 PM): I can't believe someone got the name "SoiledCockBag".  Played Sharky's tonight. Not sure if we won or lost but I took 11 pts YAY me!   I picked up so all is well.. Tommy is a God send.  Willie decided to fuck me around so fuck him.  I'll pick up from tommy for a while... Rotating them out is always a good thing.  Brian will be taking care of things this weekend while I am up north.  You can catch him on the cell phone.  Thursday night dinner at mom's  because I can't seem to stay out of round lake no matter how hard I try.  Followed by a trip out to gloria's at least tha's the game plan.  Friday morning I will be on the gravel pit loading up trucks.  Be home about 3pm.  If you need anything just call me.  To my witchy ladies... Wishy wishy that Carl DOESN'T move.  I really really don't want to let him go just yet.
