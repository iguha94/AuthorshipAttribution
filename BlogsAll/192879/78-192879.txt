I'm home I'm home I'm home!!!!  Home sweet home there's nothing like it in the world.  Nice and peaceful, serene, a tad lonely but not too awful bad thank God for speed dial and unlimited long distance.  Gloria I'd be so bored without you..  I can't wait to do Friday slumber parties.  Wendy might be joining us.  It;s so nice to have another witch in my life.   I called Mother Witch and she didn't answer the phone today but I left a cookie Wendy and I made.  I wrote a long ass letter to Arlyn.  I really hope he reads it and doesn't just flip the switch and do a jackal and Hyde thing to me.  It was a Gloria approved letter.  Just basically saying what I've been telling Gloria for like 13 years.  This is my first letter to him like this.  I'm not sure what his reaction's gonna be.  I figured Allison left for Florida, so I need to mend a heart for a while.  I hope he's gentle with me.    David I'd be so fucked without you.  Thank you so much for just being you.  You are my heaven sent angel.  Everyone needs one.  I think I'm Arlyn's he always seems to come to me when he needs me the most.  I always need you.  You ground me.  Thank you for having indefinite patience.  Chris, all I can say is you're VERY welcome.. You know what I'm talking about :).  Just remember to walk away from him in your dreams and I promise it will go away!  Allie, missed you heaps and heaps!  I'm leaving for Toronto on Sunday.  Maybe I'll see you next week along with Mr. Lucke  Bitch, what the hell is wrong with your cell phone?!?!?!?!?!?!?  Unfucker, miss ya, I'll come down and see ya when the cards go out.  I have tons to tell you.  Pics of the house are available upon request.
