Arlynd you are an asshole.  I cant believe you were like that again!!  All I was trying to do was sober you up a bit.  God somedays I just hate you I really do.  Should have been a clue when you jumped off your van and I had to stop you from falling.  Anyway, hope you are safe.  All the sudden I know where I belong.  Been a long time since I felt this way.  I want you all to smack me if you see me fucking up me and Brian.  Larry asked me last night what's taking us so long.  I'm not sure what he meant by that.  If it's what I think it is then I'm really not sure what's taking us so long.  Maybe just me getting a job could be it.  It's a priority thing.  I mean him and I are a priority, but money talks.    Strange of all the people in my life being with Brian was not what I had planned on.  I asked him last night what makes us keep coming back to each other, he said he's not sure.  I asked him a bunch of other serious questions and he actually answered them.  I guess I will just wait for him to get up then cuddle in so he knows i am there.  Allie girl.. I miss ya honey  Jeff, just be a friend hon.. that what i need right now.
