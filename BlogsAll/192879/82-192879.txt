I wrote carl one last letter.  Basically stating if he doesn't call me by 4:00pm on friday that I am assuming that he doesn't want to have anything to dowith me anymore and I will not bother him anymore. Along with a business deal that I don't hink he is taking me seriously on.  He really doesn't knwo me as well as he thinks.  I wrote arlyn a text message basically giving him til 4:00pm on friday to call me or I am going to assume he doesnt' want to have anything to do with me.    I got 20 pin numbers done last night while I was zoned so I have something to bring to dinner tomorrow.  Brian started working in the deli so hes on nights now.  Ryan is over all the time and i really don't care because he's on the same sleep schedule I am on it works out well.  I have to take linda to the dr and I have to be in R.L. by 8:45 if u happen to notice the post time that might give u some indication of what kind of day I've  had and I've been so completely stoned that I really don't even give a shit.  These next few days are going to be nerve wrecking.  I need all the friends I got right now.  Trying to get rid of drama is not easy.  I feel so much better now afer i wroe those emails and blogged. I'm not going to have a problem sleeping.  I posted new lyrics.  I offered to set up an email group for cathy about a summer gathering we are having up there.  Not everyone's going tobe invited this is her thing not mine. I happen to have the farm she needs.  So between working for my dad and helping out cathy with this shindig I don't have time for games.  Those are the two game players and I can't do it anymore
