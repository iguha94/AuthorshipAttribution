I was just wondering...  Why do they make AA AAA C and D batteries but not B batteries?  When a guy drills you a million and one questions what does that mean? Does that mean he remotely cares?  He was asking "so who's bud light is in the garbage", knowing damn well I don't drink beer. So I told him it was Bill's (Kelly's hubby). Then he asked me why I made sure that Bill got with Tama Then he asked me if he was the only one.  I told him no Brian.  He sounded suprised.  It was almost like he was "hurt".  I mean how can you hurt  someone that doesn't have a heart?  I know i've told him before but maybe it never sank in, or I just assumed he knew.  .  For someone that doesn't want me as a "girlfriend" he sure seemed genuinely concerned about who i was "hanging" with.  I have SO many questions I need answers to.  You know some questions that if i had the answer for it would ease my mind as to why he is the way he is.  Wonder if I will ever feel comfortable enough to ask him.  How can I care about two people that are so totally different from each other?  I mean Arylnd breaths life in to me while Brian mellows me out.  Arylnd always says I gotta go I gotta go but never wants to leave.  Brian never wants to leave my side.  Both are family oriented.  Both are hard workers.  Brian has a lot of respect for me where Arlynd doesn't.. That's about his only negative.  Sexually they are night and day different.  Not as different in size or shape but I mean how they are.  One is a dom one is more sub. One is more sensual.  One is more kinky.  AHHHHHHHHHHHH it's killing me!  I'm so torn!
