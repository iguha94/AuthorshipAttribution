OK so Jeff and I talked and kissed and "made up".  At least until my next blow up... I made him tell me 5 reason why he loves me.  Actually I was rather suprised what came out of his mouth. I don't remember the order but.    1) because I stuck by him during the lowest parts of his life 2) because my sexual horizon are never quite fullfilled and they seem infinate 3) because I love him 4) because I am a friend and i can't remember 5  anyway... at least I made him sit and think about why he puts up with my mood swings.  OK idea hopping.. For all those who require a weeks plan out of me.  Friday, yes mike it's Friday now... Get last paycheck from Mcd's and turn in uniforms.  Cash my check and run to petsmart to return a dead fish Saturday hang out with Jon and Rhoda.. I hope Sunday pack up my puter, load up the green tub, pack up the car, hook Jeff's puter up to the cable modem, Finish up laundry and actually put it away, watch Soprano's.
