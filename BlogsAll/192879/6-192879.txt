Good Lord!  What a day! Jeff and I decided NOT to go to Port Huron.  Not that big of  a deal.  I decided to take out my lap top and see if the fucking thing would boot. Threw a win2k cd in it.  It Powered up, seemed to try and read the hard drive then tried to read the cdrom.  Still no boot. So I called Arlynd "THE MAN".  He said he'll fix it.  So i said well ya i assume u have the right tools, and his response was... Ya and I have the right tool to fix other things too.. AND OH MY i melted.  God I love when he talks like that.  Normally it's not a turn on for me, but that means I am doing something right.  My nrother said I should go grab him.  I think I will maybe talk to him about what he wants, besides the absolute obvious.  I placed an ad on sexyads for Round Lake.  No hits just yet.  Oh well, no big loss.  I relaized that Jeff isn't all that bad of a guy, I'm just SO homesick he can do nothing right.  Kelly and Bill are going to drive me nuts, but that's ok they are worth it.  After careful contempation, I think the red headed dork from the horse racing is gonna get knocked off for fucking with the horse.  Just a thought.
