As suspected...  Pissed off my first person about the hike in prices... And the uping in the fronts but I can't do it for less anymore.. This is how I make my money... Sales are up yes but I am only making about $200 on the qp with the way this is going and then i ahve to wait for money I am out before the money is paid and I have to sweat it.  I can't do that any more.. When Brian puts his foot down there's not a whole lot I am going to do to stop that.  He's right tho.  Why should I have to wait weeks/months for money yet they have all ready smoke my weed... Not gonna happen anymore... Rules of the hosue.... Friday ALL money is due.. Can't pay me by Friday too damn bad.  I need either a check or some money down otherwise it's $10 extra.  If the check bounces or I am unable to cash it on Friday $20 fee and $5 a day will be added until it's paid off.  This goes for EVERYONE..  No exceptions.. Sorry guys.. This year i'm taking care of #1.  If i want to open shop in June something has to drastically change around here.  I am not a bank and i refuse to get walked on if this means that i close up shop cause no one can understand this then so be it. I don't want it to happen that way.  But I am fed up.. Last week I had $425 outstanding no weed and couldn't pick up for 2 days... WHY??? I shouldn't have to do that.. This is a business.. Friendships aside this is a business..  I hope you all understand taht's why you are my friend!
