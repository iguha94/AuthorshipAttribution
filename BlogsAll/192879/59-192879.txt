{{{{{{{Katy}}}}}}}  i almost 4got about quizzes.  seems like i almost 4got aout a lot of things.  finding myself again.  & really that has nothing 2 do with Alan.  i lose myself all the time.  well, not ALL the time.  but it seems 2 happen when i stop writing.  not the poetry, but when i stop journaling & even that has been damn near impossible - believe me i've tried - lately.  that sounds kinda rediculous, huh?  but really, it feels like i don't know who the fuck i am unless i write (or type) it all out.  perhaps therapy has conditioned me 2 be this way?!?!?  anyway, i'm not gonna go on & on.  2day is a good day so i'm not gonna ruin it.  i'll just say i think it's my delusions that r making things doubly hard.  maybe my head is more screwed up than even i know.   okee... going on a quiz spree now ;oP      You are a muse.     What legend are you? . Take the Legendary Being Quiz by   Paradox         Congratulations, you're Seattle, the Emerald City.  What US city are you?   Take the quiz  by   Girlwithagun  .  i resent the fact that they don't have minneapolis listed.  ok...i'm bored with the quizzes.  am gonna go read & lose myself summore.  but it's such a good book!!!
