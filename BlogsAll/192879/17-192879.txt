Well How was my birthday???  I got an oh by the way happy birthday from my dad and mike AFTER I called them.  I didnt even talk to my mom.  I sent Mike out the page that has the motherboard I want on it so we will see if that happens.    Day started out by me helping Kelly move out AGAIN.  Followed by hanging out with little Kelly and getting blown off by Barb.  Followed by Dinner with Rich at El Rodeo, which was about the only good thing of the day.  Then I had to go to Sharkys and shoot.  I didnt taking any points again, against a team I hate.  John Weber was whooping my ass in pool but got some good tips off of him, I need to work on my English.    Got back to the bar and was drilled about me and Arylnd.  At that time, I was told he walked in with Kelly Friday night and Saturday and went home with Laura on Saturday night.  So when I asked Kelly about it she said he was there all ready both nights when she walked in.  When I asked Arlynd about Lora he confirmed the fact that he fucked her.  He cant seem to figure out why its my business.  Its like hello if you are fucking me and her damn right its my business.  I was also told by Tama that Kelly said I wanted her.  I told Tama that if I wanted her shed know it.  I then made an announcement to everyone in the bar that Brian was my boyfriend, just so there wasnt any confusion.    All I want is my p.c. back, then he can pretty much go to hell.  You fucked me once shame on you.  You fucked me twice shame on me.    If I should stay I would only be in your way.  So Ill go, but I know, Ill think of you every step of the way.  Dolly Parton  Oh incase anyone was wondering what I got on my birthday, Brian bought me a ring.  Sort of a promise ring.  I gave him my rng my mom got me and told him as long as he has that in his possession Im not gone yet.  I havent really asked him if this ring means the same thing but Im thinking it does.
