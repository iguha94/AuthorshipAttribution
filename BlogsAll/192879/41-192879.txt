my head is racing & i'm talking 2 myself.  i think i'm going nuts again.  i haven't felt this way in a loooonnnnggg time.  it's frightning.  i dunno why, as deep inside i knew it would eventually come back.  it always comes back.  i suppose if alan could accept the fact that there is something wrong with my head things would be a bit easier, but this by far has nothing 2 do with him.  maybe him telling me constantly that i'm not crazy has something 2 with the absolute shock that i'm in about feeling this way again.  these r the moments when the gift we r given 2 just end it all seems almost a blessing.  i suppose it's a bit like physical pain that goes away & then one day just comes back 2 promise u an undisclosed period of agony.  it's agony u've gone through so many damn times that u feel it's almost not worth it 2 go through the gut-wrenching pain again.  this is not 2 say i'm going 2 kill myself.  i'm not.  i'm just saying this particular damning occurence (that happens time & time again) makes the thought run rampant through my mind.  like walking in2 a building u know is gonna come crashing down any second now & knowing u will not escape it.  would u walk in?  how about getting in2 a car with a sadistic serial killer?  no, i don't think so.  but here i am, doing it because i'm supposed 2 endure this, right?  i mean, supposedly God is not supposed 2 let that which we cannot endure happen.  ok, great, now i start crying.  i feel sick at heart, my stomach is turned like there's rotting chicken sitting in it.    i'm really glad, though, Katy, that u seem 2 have handled things wonderfully yesterday.  {{{{{Katy}}}}}}
