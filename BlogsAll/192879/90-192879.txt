Tama and bill are back together!  Linda called me crying this afternoon about Ashley.  How out of control she is all the time and such. Chris almost moved out of Star's last week due to Ashley drama.  This kid needs serous mental help.  I can't even stand going over to linda's anymore and dealing with her.  Linda is fearing her life from this kid.  It's so out of control over there.  Carl did call after that last post he either read it or I was thinking about him as he was thinking about me.  He tried telling me I wasn't going to see him for 2 more weeks.  I was like whatever.  I don't even really care what you do.  He didn't like the fact that Gloria was here and he didn't have my undivided attn.  He's just a boy  Brian had a day for the books with mom shit today.  Came over here cryin. I felt so bad for him he's been doing so good on getting caught up on bills and stuff.  I mean he's a moron don't get me wrong.  His mom's such a ragging bitch.  I feel bad I can't deal with him and he has to deal with her.  I just can't handle him everyday.  Gloria found a latino man at the bar she started working at but playing her cards straight she's realizing she can't deal with steve when there is so much more out there.  You go girl!  Roger is still missing whoever stole him please bring him back.
