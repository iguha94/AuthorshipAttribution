Well I just had a HUGE business talk with allison it was like a 3 hour pow wow on weed selling 101.  I have to have the same talk with Ryan so we can get this shit off the floor.  I want a pent house not a basement apartment.  If that makes sense to anyone.  Anyway the deal is $10 a g $15 a g delivered.  I son't sell it any other way.. Break at the o... Took me 3 hours to explain it to allison that my week ends on Tuesday night.  I do all my books have to have my numbers in to the boss by 10pm Wednesday night  As long as you guys all understand that i can not get better stuff for cheaper money if i'm not being charged $150 on the front.  Sometimes I am only short $60 to not be charged $150.. Now that I have regular prices I can give you regular prices (previously stated).  If you want me to deliver it ok, but I'm not going to be out any money.  Come get it yourself.  I can make just as much money without having to go anywhere.  If you want an o or more this price does not apply.  I think that was the kist of the conversation.  After a few for instances and bowls later Allison finally understood.  I think I can explain it more to ryan so he can explain it to gary and brice.. Make this whole thing flow really well.  Now about my teeth.. Those are done for now.. Gotta get these gums down.  Maybe see a paradontist.  Not til after the wedding.. Just gonna do that the doc says (for once).  My gums will look alot better for the wedding and that's what's important.. After the wedding I can go on Brian's health insurance..  Then the real work starts..    Speaking of wedding plans I got to pick out a lot of music.. Just gonna start with what I had and do it all over.. With this whole new outlook on how crappy my family is there will be new plans coming.. Gotta jam for now.
