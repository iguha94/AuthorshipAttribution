Welcome aboard david.  You know now I really realized why we are friends in the first place.  Sometimes I know you really get it.  It's been a long time since I've had a guy I can confide in about everything.  That's what a true friend does.  Listens when he needs ot and loves you anyway.  Welcome to my next thirty years.  Posted these lyrics on my lyrics page too   My Next Thirty Years - Tim McGraw   I think I'll take a moment, celebrate my age  The ending of an era and the turning of a page  Now it's time to focus in on where I go from here  Lord have mercy on my next thirty years   Hey my next thirty years I'm gonna have some fun  Try to forget about all the crazy things I've done  Maybe now I've conquered all my adolescent fears And I'll do it better in my next thirty years   My next thirty years I'm gonna settle all the scores  Cry a little less, laugh a little more  Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear  Figure out just what I'm doing here  In my next thirty years   Oh my next thirty years, I'm gonna watch my weight  Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late  Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers  Maybe I'll remember my next thirty years   My next thirty years will be the best years of my life  Raise a little family and hang out with my wife  Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear  Make up for lost time here, In my next thirty years   In my next thirty years
