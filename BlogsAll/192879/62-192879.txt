Tomorrow is a money day!!!!!!!!!!  Successes with your work continue to bring good fortune your way, and today you might find reassurance that this is not a flash in the pan - you're likely to be financially secure for a long time. Health-wise, you're probably feeling strong and robust, full of energy and stamina, and ready to take on just about any challenge you can find. Move on ahead, dear Sagittarius, but move with caution. You're never too prosperous to be careful.  I have to go to the dentist and I am totally fearing it.  I mean like I am so scared I don't even want to go.  It;s a new dentist in a new office with new people.  The only comfort I have is Candy will be there so I know I am not just another number.  This is EXTREMELY hard for me to do.  The only reason why I have to do it now is because if my mouth looks better then I will be more inclined to loose weight.  I need to start feeling better about myself so I can go get a job.  Right now I have 0 self esteem.  0 reason to want to plan a wedding because I don't feel like I am marriage material right now.  Kind of in a blah about myself. Anyway, me and my mom are friends again.  I have this nasty headacvhe i can't seem to get rid of.  I can't sleep.  So I'm up playing cards.  Insomnia sucks!   My wellness scope which pretty much sums up what i just said... this week's been too flipping bizarre  Sagittarius Wellness Scope Sun Jan. 11, 2004  Ask yourself what you need to feel really comfortable in your body. Do you need to be in better physical condition? Do you need to feel stronger, have more flexibility, feel lighter or heavier? The way we live inside our bodies has everything to do with how we treat others and how we let others treat us. Unless we exist in a physical reality to our liking, it is difficult to create the emotional reality that we desire.
