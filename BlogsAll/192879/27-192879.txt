Well let's see last night sucked!  I got off school Dave was here.  I knew he was having a bad day cause he hardly spoke two words to me except for don't go with Arlyn.  I'm like what the fuck.  Took me all I had not to cry.  Almost succeeded.  We talked a lot of things out.  Nothing I want to go in to detail about.  After I left I felt like shit.  I realized I hurt when we fight because he has a place in my heart that is scaring the hell out of me and I'm too afraid to have that space missing by him not being around.  I'm trying to prove to him every time i see him that I'm grateful for what he's done for me.  I'm not sure if I am succeeding or not.  I told him that, as I started crying.  I figured by then he's gonna think I'm nuts.  I still haven't heard from him yet today so I think he's pulling that defense thing again.  I told him I'm hurt that he's blocking me out.  I mean I just layed it all on the line.  So we'll see if he'll call me.  I'm not going to call him if our friendship means as much to me as it does to him then he'll call me.  I caught Chris at Star's  SUCKED ASS.  My heart dropped out of my chest.  I mean deep down I knew it was going to happen.  I was just so hurt it was a night him and I had plans.  REVENGE IS A DISH BEST SERVED COLD!
