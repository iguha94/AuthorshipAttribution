There's another world inside of me that you may never see  There's secrets in this life that I can't hide  Well somewhere in this darkness there's a light that I can't find  Well maybe it's too far away  Or maybe I'm just blind  Maybe I'm just blind   So hold me when I'm here  Right me when I'm wrong  Hold me when I'm scared  And love me when I'm gone  Everything I am  And everything in me  Wants to be the one you wanted me to be  I'll never let you down  Even if I could  I'd give up everything  If only for your good  So hold me when I'm here  Right me when I'm wrong  Hold me when I'm scared  You won't always be there  So love me when I'm gone  Love me when I'm gone   When your education x-ray cannot see under my skin  I won't tell you a damn thing that I could not tell my friends  Roaming through this darkness, I'm alive but I'm alone  And part of me is fighting this  But part of me is gone   So hold me when I'm here  Right me when I'm wrong  Hold me when I'm scared  And love me when I'm gone  Everything I am  And everything in me  Wants to be the one you wanted me to be  I'll never let you down  Even if I could  I'd give up everything  If only for your good  So hold me when I'm here  Right me when I'm wrong  Hold me when I'm scared  You won't always be there  So love me when I'm gone  Love me when I'm gone   Maybe I'm just blind   So hold me when I'm here  Right me when I'm wrong  Hold me when I'm scared  And love me when I'm gone  Everything I am  And everything in me  Wants to be the one you wanted me to be  I'll never let you down  Even if I could  I'd give up everything  If only for your good  So hold me when I'm here  Right me when I'm wrong  Hold me when I'm scared  You won't always be there  So love me when I'm gone  Love me when I'm gone, Love me when I'm gone, When I'm gone When I'm gone When I'm gone  - 3 doors down
