Ok this is how my day's been.. I think I need a little help from above.  It's been one of those days were your whole world could actually flip over and you'd still be ok.  I am so done with Arlyn that I hate him.  He's such a ball of energy tho that he's addicting...  That's all he is an addiction..  He got that lightning bolt on his arm because he said that I used to call him the bolt.  I mean I did call him that but that he actually did a tattoo about it made me think MAYBE this time he figured it out.  He will never figure it out. So established relationship with Arlyn is no longer! Established my relationship with Craig and Carl.  It's been a good day IU thought the talk I was supposed to have was Arlyn.  It turned out to be Carl.  Oh ya and me and Todd are totally cool!  GOD, grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change Courage to change the things I can and the Wisdom to know the difference.  Living ONE DAY AT A TIME; Enjoying one moment at a time; Accepting hardship as the pathway to peace.  Taking, as He did, this sinful world as it is, not as I would have it.  Trusting that He will make all things right if I surrender to His Will;  That I may be reasonably happy in this life, and supremely happy with Him forever in the next.  Amen
