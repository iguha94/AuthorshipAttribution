the biggest event of the year just took place this afternoon in the very hall of Riverside Secondary School's holding site in sembawang. students taking this year's GCE O level exams, namely and in particular, ME, Amanda Ang, actually found the a maths paper 2 easy!! Woah.........totally spacey man! *LOLx* well, that was the plus point for the whole day's exam, downside is that the chemistry paper really sucked! yeah........dun tink i gonna score very well for my combine science... feel so stupid suddenly. its like the pure science students have to do the subjects pure wor....and not many of them are complaining about plus, they are like scoring A's for it while me, i'm just doing it as a combine subject, its like half of their toughness man! and i'm already struggling like crazy.........boy, i feel stupid.   sometimes i really dun get it, how is intelligence determined? by a certificate telling the world how well u can memorise the textbook? or how well u can pull math questions apart and solve it? haiz..........i dun get anything! hrm.........maybe i'm like thinking too much and too deeply about too many stuff........its making my life really complicated and stuffy! i mean i'm a well feed, well breed kid, i should just be enjoying my life and youth man! why the heck am i getting all worked up about work starvation and the education system for?? maybe i should just learn to accept things the way they are like everyone else has............maybe that would like really make things a lot easier and simpler, maybe it'll make my day a lot brighter and a lot happier... what do you think?
