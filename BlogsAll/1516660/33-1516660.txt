          Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix  Reviews (Part 2)   *Note: Same old warning yeah. This contains spoilers...yada yada yada...close window  Ahh! Ahhh! The truth is out! The reason to the rentless and murderous attacks of Voldemort towards Harry. He was scared by a prophecy, made by Sybil Trelawny.  She prophesized that  Voldemort's demise will in the hands of a child born in the death of July, to whom has defied Voldemort thrice. Voldemort will make him an equal. Neither will survive as long as the other is alive.  Ahh yes! The foolishness of Voldemort. He was actually scared of being defeated! He came after Harry.   Everybody is spectaculating who's dying in the fifth book. Oh well. The mystery's solved. The answer is:  kcalb suiris  (read it backwards). Such a horror! I always liked him! But nevertheless, he died for Harry. Such a noble cause! Ahh!  Among these things, the funniest was that the whole school is revolting against the reign of Umbridge the old cow. Terribly funny, I tell ya. The teacher's actions were rather surprising, but I must appluad them on their "courage". Try reading McGonagall's actions/views against the cow. You will get a kick out of it.   The ending. Everything was resolved. Umbridge was driven off. The mystery's solved. Harry can have a happier, and possibly, safer summer. But the war still continues, as the enemy has not fell.
