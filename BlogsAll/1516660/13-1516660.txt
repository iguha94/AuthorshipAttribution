hrm........nothing much on today, or should i say this week. something just entered my mind yesterday, would anyone like another to forget the first? hrm....if so, den wun it be kinda unfair to the later?? in this case y would anyone want to do so? is it better to love or be loved in return? hrm...wad is considered better? it all depends on the person loving u and the one u're loving in return doesn't it?   it differs one from another. if one is to say that loving one is more fortunate then let me put across then. what if the person that u have given u're heart to isn't one who'll reciprocrate ur feelings? then in this case is it still more fortunate to love than to be loved? is all the pain worth it? isn't it better to be placing ur heart into someone else who will appreciate wad u have offered? silly as it may sound, i'd rather love than to be loved. to love another would mean i'm given the choice of whom to choose to love. i'd find it harder to be facing, yes, someone who loves me but isn't someone i love at all. it'll make my life miserable and his, a dillusion. this way, it hurts both parties. if it muz be den i'd rather i be the one to be hurting, hey, at least onli one person needs to suffer rite?    love is best given and received best shared and presented  but alas, love makes us fools too blind to perceive  too blind to judge  love binds but it also breaks one once said love is about sacrifices never about being sorry perhaps its true  a mixture of letting go and holding on a mixture of remembering and forgiving a mixture of laughter and tears a wait, a simple wish, a hope upon a falling star, waiting to come true
