         Ergh! Today was a very bad day, in terms of getting back my results!  English:   HORRENDOUS  ! With a captial  H . My all time low! A C5! So.....dissappointing! I merely passed both papers. Bah. I   hate   myself. However, on a lighter note, I felt really happy for CQ, WQ they all. They passed English. Imagine the look on their faces, epecially WQ when they passed their English! Sheer joy and happiness!  Really happy for them!  I am so  proud  of them!  I really regret saying "Why should you be happy over such measly marks? Even I am not.". Really selfish of me!  I am feeling unhappy, and shouldn't vent my anger on them. Really sorry, guys!  Physics: Well, I passed. Yeah! And I got A2 for Combined Science. I got a distinction, something to be proud of! And I hope I  can get top.  I really do! I want to!  SS/History: Well, a major surprise for me for my SS. Didn't expect her to give me 6 for the lousy SEQ (not really that lousy la! she said it was a good argument, but I wrote out of point). This is what we call "sympathy marks". I should have gotten 0 for that question. But hey! Who should complain? Certainly not me. For both History and SS, I got distinction. Not too bad. I ended up getting an A1 for Combined Humantities. I also got  top  for History! Wee!! (Okay, CQ they all will say: bu yao nian!)  Today's basketball game was fabulous! Well, we kinda tied for the first few minutes (okay...make that 5...no 10)....until 3/6 shot in the first ball. But later on, as the game progresses, 4/5 clearly emerges top! And we won! Weee!!! Congrats!! Tomorrow is the finals! So exciting! I hope we can win!!   Suwawa! Go clean the toilets now!   Cannot, sir! So dirty!
