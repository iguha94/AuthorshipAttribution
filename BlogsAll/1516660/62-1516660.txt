         Today, I didn't publish "this" (refer to yesterday's entry). You are probably thinking  wimp  right? Nope. I was about to, determined to. Somehow, Wendy managed to convince me not to, stating it would show that I lack of a certain maturity doing things if I had done that. HaHa. Frankly speaking, I am very tired of all this! Extremely damn sick and tired of all this! I want it to end! I don't want to suffer anymore. Don't want to. I think, it all depends on X now. What X does will determine the outcome of this whole thing. I am washing my hands off. I am not going to change things anymore. I got sick and tired of doing that already. It's up to X now.   Today was pretty boring. Did the usual of watching TV in the morning, and I have been online since 11am.    Benjamin wants to borrow my Harry potter books. He said he would be coming over, and until now, he hasn't called. I am not gonna bother actually. If he wants my books, he has to come over and get it himself.   If you noticed, I didn't put my usual lyrics for the day. Well, I don't know lor......I should probably go expand my music industry first. Then I know what lyrics to put according to my mood and so on. And one good way to do that is download all the songs Wendy has put in her blog (as lyrics). And I should probably do that now. Meow Meow!
