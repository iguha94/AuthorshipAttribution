I haven't been the mood to write anything for days already, I lost my love again. =) I guess after 1 whole week of mourning, I'll be fine la...I'll cry a lil' while more but after the crying, I'm sure I'll recover. I don't think I'll ever love anyone as much ever again, no matter how hard I try. I'll always love Mun. He's the first pity he couldn't be the last...But he'll be the last person to ever make me cry this much ever again.... =) I'll be fine!  well, let's see...Orientation ended last nite with a bang man! There was a lot of dancing, especially in my part. haha. I was on the  dane floor almost all the time and yeah, I was wild man! haha... I guess I was dancing to get Mun off my mind...It really helps u know? To get ur body in this really super hyper and tired state then things seem to become so much simpler. so i did, i got myself totally soaked and tired out, actually all 3 days of orientation had been totally tiring but i guess it was fun la...i got tot know my class mates lo..haha. not all of them i like though...i don't like nicole and desmond for starters. they both got attitude sia! nicole has this unbearable air around her that really makes her irritating. her refusal to participate in the activities din help either, she's always so bz clicking away on her mobile and well, just irritating lo! =S desmond wasn't any better, he's very rude and totally no respect for the rest of the class. he doesn't help out during activities either and well, like nicole just plain attitude and irritating!! well, whatever lo. dun step on my toes or i'll make sure u regret ever knowing me lo. when i bitch, i'll go all out one so dun start me.
