         YaY! Today was fun!!  We went to Pasir Ris Park, after many trials and tribulations, which I shall not go into detail with. First of all, we rented bicycles and rode them all around Pasir Ris Park, from one end to the next. My bum was sore. Seriously.....  Then, we went down to the sea. Okay, I didn't really go down, but i only wetted my feet. That meow meow Wen Qiang ar. Throw water at me! LoL! I shrieked, but I kinda enjoy it la. WQ ar, next time, I am gonna 'revenge' liao. :P to you if you are reading this.  After that, they changed clothes. My towel that wasn't supposed to be a towel was used by WQ as a towel. Okay, that was my extra shirt. Biege in colour. Ayiah, lend him la. See him all wet and didn't bring towel. And I made him wash it for me. And there goes my one of my outing clothes. Now I am only left with blue and grey. Hmm...what should I wear to the movie tomorrow?  One of the most interesting thing was that Wendy's kite got stuck up there....and we tried to roll back the strong It was horrendously long. I marvelled at the height of the sky......Wow!  We took some pictures. So fun! I am gonna have them!  We went home at 6.50 (which WQ reminded us again and again)..rode the bus and the MRT and reached home at 9! Ahh!  Ayiah, one note for a particular someone: It's not that I don't want to tell, I can't. Get it? And you asked if you were the one being hated. I was thinking of saying "No la! Who would hate such a loveable (tian zheng ke ai) person?" to drive you away from the topic, but I find it too er xin and gan ga to say it out. :P Ayiah......you will know it soon enough. On the other hand, I don't think you will too. HaHa. My advice to you: Try to be more observant. Yeah.   So tired le....meow meow. Goodnight.  Countdown:  3  Days to Order of Phoenix
