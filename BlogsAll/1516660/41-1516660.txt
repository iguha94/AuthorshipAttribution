         Heya! I got back my report slip. Not really, but I have a look. I feel so happy. These are some of the things I feel happy about:  --> 'Kelvin' was finally...and I mean FINALLY added to my name! YaY!  --> Mrs Chew basically said a lot of good things about me! I am so happy! Things she said include "Kelvin yip is a polite and courteous pupil.......(forgot)........enthusiastically participates in group work and class projects." Thank you, Mrs Chew!!  --> Mr marks:  EL : 59.2 (C5)  MT : 62 (B4)  Bio : 71.2  (A2)  Combined Science (Chem/Phy):  72.3 (A2)    Combined Humanities (SS/Hist) : 79 (A1)  A-Maths : 59 (C5)  E-Maths : 68 (B3)   Average : 68.5  L1R5 : 17  Quite proud of my marks. Got 3 As this time round. Same as last year. Cheh. No improvement! But I got the highest for Chemistry and History. I always do (okay, very buay hao bai :p). :p So happy with my results.  Even though I am happy, I am still sad actually. My friends all got results which they aren't even proud of. And one failed English, thinking he passed.  WHAT A LOUSY WEIGHTAGE SYSTEM! HOW DARE YOU FAIL MY FRIEND? . Er-hmm. I really feel sorry for them. They worked hard, harder than me. They deserve to win me. They really do. F*** the weightage system. Not really. Just an expression. Bah!  Signing off for the night! Goodnight!
