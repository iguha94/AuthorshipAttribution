         If you are looking for X's news, I still don't know. Seriously. I am a useless arse. Can't even do well in basic friendship.  Today, I attended Zhang's class. He's a nice teacher...very nice lor. His students (the boys la) like to throw their temper a lot, so today, there was a "show"...with insults flying everywhere. Luckily, Zhang said, "If you don't want to study, then don't. Don't create trouble for those who want (obviously, us)." Oh! I feel so glad that I am at least looked after! He's a nice teacher, but gets angry when he doesn't get the respect from his students. His teaching method is almost like Du's, but place less emphasis on reading the text. We did the vocab today. Hmm, not bad la.  Today, I rushed to study Chem. Seriously lor. Later I have tution, and I don't have time. Let me see...Few People Prefer David Lee's Brain (Fuel, Petroleum, Paraffin, Diesel, Lubricating oil and Bitumen)! Okay...alkenes undergoes hydrogenation (adding of hydrogen to form alkanes), adding of reactive halogens and hydration (add water to form alcohols). And lots lots more. Why does the Bunsen burner burns with yellow flame when airhole is closed? Because it undergoes an incomplete conbustion due to the lack of oxygen. Soot is produced, which burns with a yellow flame. STOP KY! There is no such thing as methene, because there are no 2 carbon atoms to even have a covalent bond with. So, mathane comes form natural gas, which comes from the decay of vegetation. AYIAH! STOP LA! Isomers are different organic compounds with the same molecular formula. Okay Okay, I stop now. But I must tell you that the general formules are CnH2n+2 and CnH2n for alkanes and alkenes respectively. Okay Okay! Stop throwing rotten eggs!  Okay, due to time constraint, I cnanot post lyrics for the song. Even the cats meow. Goodnight! And good luck for the Chem test ar, Kelvin Yip, and so does the rest of you la hor.
