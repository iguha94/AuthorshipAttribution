         I am beginning to feel that eating is a terrible waste of time. I hate eating when I have a blocked nose. What good is eating when you can't even taste the food? Well, this might be the best time to put all those disgusting stuff inside my food....since I can't taste them, I won't vomit it out. Of course, I wouldn't eat it because I don't want that stuff to enter my digestive system. I am going way off point here.  Oh yeah, back to the topic. After writing my earlier entry...I surfed around aimlessly. Then I did the things Tsung asked me to....blah blah blah....printer no ink...A Drive something wrong. Switched off computer to eat my tasteless lunch. After that, came back, printed (brought new ink tank), saved and switched off the computer.  I fell alsleep the whole afternoon. Was rudely waken up by my idiotic brother to drink my medicine. Put me in a damn bad mood. Then, I found out my father redeemed another cordless phone from Shell. Ate yet antohet tasteless dinner. Read finished the second RavenWolf book and watched Holland V. Now online.  Tomorrow got ting xie. And Chem practical. But I am still feeling sick. If i go, I might avargrate (dunnoe how to spell la!) my illness, and I certainly don't want that. Also don't wanna go because I am still feeling weak (heck! all this typing already made me weak), but tomorrow got chem practical and ting xie. I don't want to take ting xie outside the classroom, and also miss a valuable chem practical. Sigh..Wendy and WQ told me to rest at home to re-cuperate. Don't know la. See tomorrow first lor...if I am still feeling weak or not.  Sigh..I ending off here le...Goodnight.
