         Heya. It's me again.  Okay, I want to share a link. It is:   http://www.mugglenet.com/facts.shtml   Yep! Facts about Book 5!! So cool!! Let me discuss some of the facts:  --> The choice between what's right and what's easy will be a pillar of the plot in Harry's last 3 years.  Easily the most difficult choice. And rather cliche. We can already know Harry would choose the "right" choice. However, I do hope she will throw us a trick or two, and let Harry choose the "easy" choice.  --> Harry will have to deal with a venemous, disgruntled house-elf.   Oo!! A disgruntled elf. This gotta be exciting.  --> There will be a female Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher with a personality like poisoned honey.   I can imagine guys falling in love with her....and finds out, much to their horror and at the last minute, she is not whom that they think. "Poisoned Honey" gave that away....But still, it is interesting to read.  --> One of the main characters, one of Harry's "fans" will die (not Ron or Hermione). The death will be "horrible to write."  Thank god it is not Ron or Hermione. Harry's fan? Pah! Colin Creevey springs to mind. And so does Dennis Creevey. Horrble to write? Oh my! I am imagining multilation at its worst. Ooopff!   Oh well. There ends my commentary. Read the rest yourself. Goodnight.
