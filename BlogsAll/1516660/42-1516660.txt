         Heya! I have really nothing to write today. So, I shall present to you one of my favorite songs: Back Here, by BBMak. Those lines in bold are the ones I really like. Those in italicised are lthe parts which I love. And always spark something in me when the song reaches that part. Love...perhaps?   Back Here - BBMak  Baby set me free From this misery I can't take it no more Since you ran away Nothing's been the same Don't know what I'm living for  Here I am, so alone   And there's nothing in this world I can do   (Chorus)  Until you're back here, baby  Miss you, want you, need you so  Until you're back here, baby, yeah There's a feeling inside, I want you to know You are the one and I can't let you go   So I told you lies Even made you cry Baby, I was so wrong Girl, I promise you Now my love is true There is where my heart belongs  'Cos here I am, so alone And there's nothing in this world I can do    Until you're back here, baby  Miss you, want you, need you so  Until you're back here, baby, yeah There's a feeling inside, I want you to know You are the one and I can't let you go    And I wonder (wonder) Are you thinking of me 'Cos I'm thinking of you  And I wonder (wonder) Are you ever coming back in my life  'Cos here I am, so alone And there's nothing in this world I can do    Until you're back here, baby  Miss you, want you, need you so  Until you're back here, baby, yeah There's a feeling inside, I want you to know You are the one and I can't   Until you're back here, baby ('Til you're back here, baby) Until you're back here, baby ('Til you're back) You're back Until you're back here, baby ('Til you're back here, baby)    There's a feeling inside, I want you to know  You are the one and I can't Until you're back here, baby ('Til you're back here, baby, come here) Until you're back here, baby ('Til you're back, you're back) Until you're back here, baby ('Til you're back here, baby) Ohhh Until you're back here, baby ('Til you're back, you're back) Until you're back here, baby ('Til you're back here, baby) Until you're back here, baby
