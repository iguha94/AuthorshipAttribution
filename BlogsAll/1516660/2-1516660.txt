People killing People dying Children hurting And women crying Do you practice what you preach  Or do you turn the other check?  From "Where is the love"  yeah, i'm back. i was reading the morning paper a while ago and once again, i was confronted by the ugly truth and yeah, trust me, its ugly. its like, everyday other day i flip the pages of the papers, there is bound to be some bombing or killing somewhere, wassup with people nowadays?? what the hell do you get from killing off fellow beings? don't they feel any pang of guilt or remorse whenever they gun down someone?? its a person for God's sake! don't they feel anything when they see the relatives and close ones cry about their lost?    hey, why dun u put urself in their shoes and think about it??   oh wait, i forgot, sometimes kill for revenge and for their beliefs. what the heck...... i thought Man were all made to be equal, no one's greater than the other. why is it that if even a monker like me can understand that logic, these self proclaimed "Religious Avengers" can't?? what's so difficult to understand? why can't people just be nice to each other for a while?    why can't people just stop and listen to each other? why dun they listen??    wun life be made a lot easier if people listened to each other and talked about their feelings?? its not easy to completely understnad another person's feelings and emotions but if we at least tried then at least it would help right? what's the point in killing and hurtung others just to prove your point or to proclaim urself superior or just hurt others to get revenge?? what's the point in it all?
