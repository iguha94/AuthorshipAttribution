         HaHa! I think I shall start a FFIX Updates whenver I play FFIX. Such an exciting game! I completed the Festival of the Hunt just now. I didn't get first, Freya did. According to my brother, she always got first, so no suprise here! Well, I am proud of my 141 score (she scored 151! HaHa!). Luckily I Synthesized The Orge (2 Mage Masher needed!)...so I got a powerful weapon for Zidane now. Now, I am about to start on my jounrey to Burmuceia. Yep!  I brought the things needed for my Blog File....so I will be doing that later, after I printed out the August entries. Yeah! I hope it goes well!  Today, Wendy looked very down. It started with her refusing to go into the Choir room. I don't know what's going on. I guess she doesn't want to meet a particular somebody there. She looks depressed. I do hope she will feel better soon. Yeah. Feel better SOON. Oh yes! Save money for wallet ar, KY!  Today, during remedial, Mrs Chew told us we have to write our own tesimony. HaHa! It's like CV (resume) lor....cannot be bashful about yourself! Come to think of it, this is kinda funny. I "testify" that KY is a good person. HaHa! And future employers would think that this is written by teachers. Ha! So fun! I advise those who are writing your own testimony that you cannot be shy...this is NOT the time to be saying, "Ayioh! So buay hao bai!". It's the time to recongise your talents, your values, your good points. If you are gonna be shy and humble, then I would say that your testimony would be very short. And too modest. Praise your own talent! Recongise you! Yeah!!  Think I write until here le. See ya next time! Byes!
