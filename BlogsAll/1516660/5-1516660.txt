alright, forget my previous entry. i was rambling along, i mean hey, i jux woke up man............doubt my mind is even working right...anyhow, i'm like really bored right now that's why i'm like rambling again...:P   know i shld be studying now, but i jux can't bring myself to do it...ARGH !! wish i could kick my own butt. its raining now, i can see the raindrops falling outside my window, beautiful. i can smell rain too, cherie would say its the smell of soil but still i call it the rain smell, its my favourite smell...i'd make it into a fragrance if i could have my way, i'd name it ' Rain' (what else??). i bet it'll smell millions... LOLx   jay chou's 'An Jing' makes a really good accompaniment for the weather now. melancholy with a lil' sense of bittersweet, i kinda like it though. not that this spells me, its just that i like it, its like, i dunno how to put this, but its like someone is like trying to tell me his story, and its a really touching tale. almost worthy of television. despite that, it seems real. almost like he is whispering it in my ear now...     promises made but none held true forever is a wait, an unseen torment for the heart, for the soul  darkness seeps as tears start to fall, faith flutters as the heart struggles to hold   on to the promise, to the dream  such pain, such agony only one would know; one who is waiting, one who is holding on, to the promise made  so long so long ago  such pain and agony,  only one who have lost before they learned to cherish would know such pain and agony, only one in love would know    i'm telling you, i'm not crazy.....serious.
