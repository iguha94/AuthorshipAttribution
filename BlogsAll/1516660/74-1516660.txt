         Oh hey! I just came back from typing out my testimonial. I was planning to write it, but decided to type it because I am able to write longer if I type it out. Yeah! Haha!  I woke up at 8.35 today...and bathed. I watched some cartoons in the morning  and went online after 11. I ate lunch at 12 and went to Wendy's house at 1.  I managed to complete my EL compre there. We talked quite a lot of topics, like friendship, graduation, life after O Levels. HaHa! I am quite excited about life after Os. What will I do? Hmm....Ha! We also discussed Prom Nite(a little). It was always interesting to go to Wendy's house and chat with her. Sometimes, I learnt quite a number of life lessons just by talking to her. HaHa! Oh yes...Lassie stinks badly. And Wendy had just bathed Lassie.   Went to eat dinner at 5.30. I ate some chicken rice and brought back chicken rice for my brother. I conversed with Wendy's mom in Cantonese today. It was quite weird...hahaha! Talking to your friend's mother in Cantonese, a language where your friend don't even understand. I asked Wendy if she felt weird or anything. Surprisingly, she said no. She just minded her own business. Hmmm.   Came back home, bathed and started on my testimonial writing. Oh boy! It was hard work. I have to refer here and there for dates and activities and helping words. Ah! But finally! I did it! A 800+ words long essay! I am proud of it! HaHa! I printed it out.  Okay, today's entry might be short. I am kinda tired from all those typing. So, see ya tomorrow! Bye bye blog! Goodnight!
