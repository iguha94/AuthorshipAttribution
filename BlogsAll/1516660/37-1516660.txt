         Sigh. Dunnoe why people these day want to commit suicide.  It would be very silly lor. To commit suicide at such a young age. You got a very beautiful life right in front of you, waiting for you to discover. Thje joys of going through adulthood. You haven't even lived half of your life, and you want to commit suicide? Siow!  Life isn't exactly a bed of roses. There are bound to be portholes along the journey. No matter how deep the porthole, we would come out of it. And when we do, we become a totally new person. Along with portholes, we are also bound to come across with joys and celebrations. We can play, party and enjoy ourselves. We look forward to these little joyful oscassions while walking life's journrey.   Killing ourselves because of relationship problems, family problems, studies, friends, etc etc isn't worth it! Totally not worth it at all! Why let these worry us? Why let these weigh us down? Why let this make us face life with a cold, hard heart? Yes, although we have become weak, but does that mean we have to stay that way forever?  NO!  Whatever for? Let people pity us? Let those who abandon us come back to us? We should   MOVE ON  . Move on with life.   Besides, we would be letting our loved ones down. At this point in time, we might not believe anyone would love us. But there are! Look at our friends! They are there when we need them! They are there to lend a shoulder for us to cry on! Look at our family! Our parents love us dearly. They love us unconditionally. If we die, wouldn't it be a big let-down to our loved ones? Abandoning them just like that. Is that reponsibility? We are making our loved ones grieve by dying, for goodness sake!   No amtter how useless we feel, we still must live on. For the sake of our loved ones, for the sake of ourselves, our glorious future.   Life is beautiful. Treasure it.
