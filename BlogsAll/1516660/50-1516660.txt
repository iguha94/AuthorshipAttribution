         Damn CityCab! How dare they! They are not re-newing my father's license. Yes! You heard it! They are firing my father? Why? Because "of your adverse accidents/serive records"! What the fuck! Accidents? Services? For 14 years! My father has only received one complaint, and that was ruled in my father's favor. How dare they bring that up again! And the accidents! My father was clear of all charges too (the current one is still pending)! How dare they use it against my father! They are biting the hand that feeds them! Everyday, my father pays $40 of rental (sometimes $80 when the relief is not working!)! $40 goes into their pocket everyday....That's $14,600 every year! Those ignorant fools! Those ungrateful idiots!   We are, of course, not going to sit here and hurl abuses at them. We have already written a letter of appeal of the Ken Tan, chief operating officer (This is one time in my life where learning how to write formal letter comes in handy). My father is going there to hand the letter in. Okay, current update: The Ken Tan told my father "Don't worry. I speak to the head about it. We will try our best to get a new taxi for you. We will let you know latest by next Monday." Phew! That's at least something. My anger has been dissipated..sort of. At least the appeal letter is working on Ken Tan. I wonder if it works on the head cat. Or I wonder if Ken Tan is saying that to console my father. CityCab is known be to "slow".   But whatever! If they reject the appeal, me and my father are going to the "Meet The Residents Session" on 1st August, asking our MP to do something about it! This is unfair action against my father! We have been treated with injustice! I must see something done! Or else...the Yip family is going back to the Stone Age. Yes! It's that worse!   They better let my father have a new taxi! They better! They had to!
