i haven't felt so betrayed in my whole life before!&nbsp; i swear, i'm never gonna trust guys again. i really never expected him to say something like tat lo. i mean, why do u even bother to put up such a front? why r u so fake? i know i'm a flirt sometimes but i know i'm not that desperate. it is my life motto, the absolute commandment in my life, to never flirt with someone who is attached, they r like the no. 1 turn off list lor...why? how can someone do that? i'm like so hurt and put off by it now that i dun really know how to react or think anymore. i guess i was right all along. guys are onli good enuf to be friends and nothing more than that. i made that mistake before and i can't believe i'm doing it again....am i dumb or what? i told myself before that guys; especially cute guys; are onli good for looking and being friends with but it seems that i've eaten my words and commited that mistake....dumb bimbo.&nbsp; thankfully, i didn't fall for him yet...i'll still be able to salvage myself...        &nbsp;   i'm gonna declare my latest life philosophy here and now:        &nbsp;   love is only a game meant for fools. its a game actually, a game that you will lose more than you win. to avoid getting hurt is to not attach yourself emotionally to anything or anyone, take things as they come and if it is to go, look else where. in this little game called love, to me that is, is all about winning ang pulling out when u know that u're about to lose so that even if you lose, you won't lose too badly. guys are onli good for looking and being friends. flirt with them if you want but never,NEVER TRUST THEM WITH UR HEART  ESPECIALLY CUTE GUYS...
