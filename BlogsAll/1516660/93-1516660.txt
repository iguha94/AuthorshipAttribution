         Ahh! Sabrina The Teenage Witch is showing! YaY! The new season! Whoo-hoo! Finally! After more than a year! Sabrina returns! And it is gonna be a weekdaily affair! Yippee! ~Sings: Things are going way too fast, I wanna make it last!~  Didn't get to play FFIX today. I came home really later after EL Practice Session. Had fun during the practice session, even though I was too nervous. HaHa! But I was lucky! Mrs Thong asked me the question me and Joyce was practicing moments before (What school do you study in? It is a mixed school or a single sex school?). HaHa! Came up with the points. Mrs Thong said good, and after I told her I practised that question before the Oral session, she said I should continue to do this for my orals! :) I will, Mrs Thong! HaHa!  Today, CQ decided that he doesn't want to sing with the choir tomorrow! WHAT IS THIS?!!! CQ said before he don't care if none of the sec 4 are joining us, he will still sing! Now now! Look at what happened! Ayioh! I want to sing with the choir, and I insist CQ and Wendy come along too! They promised!! Never mind! Tomorrow is not too late! Can still persuade CQ to sing during the morning! Ahh! I want to sing with the choir!   Oh, in case you are wondering, the one who scored 16 in the bio test along with me is Eugene. Oh. What a surprise. Oh well.  Oh oh! My ordered NDP t-shirt is extremely big! I ordered 2 sizes too big! HaHa! I thought I wear M....so I ordered L, for furture use. But! But! My mother told me I wear S! I should have ordered M! Ah! Oh well.   Hmm! I log off le la! See ya tomorrow! Me-ow Meow!
