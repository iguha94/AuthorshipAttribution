          Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix  Reviews (Part 1)  *Note: These may be considered spoilers. Read them at your own risks. Close this window if you don't want to be spoilt.  This book has grown a lot more darker. And I do mean darker. There is less funny moments. Things have changed. Very much.  One of them is Harry. He became more angrier. He became more rebellious. He became more mature.   In the story, new characters were introduced.   I like Tongs the best. She's funny, she's quirky and she's nice. She's an Auror, sent to protect Harry.   I  ABSOLUTELY DESTEST , or rather,  HATE ,  LOATHE  (and many other acronyms for "dislike") Professor Umbridge. She's the new DADA teacher. She was sent by the Ministry to keep a close watch on Dumbledore. She is there to keep things in check. She is a absolutely, horrible  BITCH . And i never detest a woman more. Except Rita Skeeter, but Umbridge is worse. I hate her! She's cow manure. She's wasting our oxygen supply. She would be better off for Demontor's food supply (the Kiss).   Er-hmm....Okay. New things are in store.  One of them, which I giggled to, is that Harry got a kiss. From Cho Chang.   I am not telling others. Read the book yourself.  I am not at page 458. Will review the rest tomorrow.
