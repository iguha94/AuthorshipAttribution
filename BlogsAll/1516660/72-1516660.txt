         Okay, this is gonna be another quickie. I just got off from tuition and I need to go watch Bao Zi Dan later!   I shall comment on the possibility of Mrs Tan, our principal, teaching us Biology. She is certified to, according to Mrs Chua, she posesses a Honors in Biology. Woah! I am quite excited about this thingy! It's a rare chance a principal is teaching us. I hope she does. That way, we can get to know her more and see her 'teacher' side. It would be exciting. But I can imagine, everyone would be too scared to answer questions. After all, she's the principal. But I think Yit Hann wouldn't la. And neither would I. We love answering questions (if we know the answer, of course!). Oooo! I hope she does teach us! That would be so ultra cool!  Ayioh! For these two days, I am rushing to blog (and it is 9.40..I better hurry up). I can't don't blog...not even for a day! Seriously! I'll suffer from blog-withdrawal. I hope the next few days I would not be so rushing to blog. I hope I can be more relaxed when blogging tomorrow (9.42 le!!!).   Okay, because of the lack of time (9.43!!), I will not be doing lyrics for today. I give you all a short hiatus from reading lyrics. But rest assured. Tomorrow I shall post lyrics again, provided I do not rush, which means hopefully there will be no homework given that would require us to pass up on Friday.   Okay, bye bye all! (Oh yes! Remind me to talk about Choir's graduation party for us At East Coast Park in tomorrow's blog! Got loads to talk about! Die Die! 9.46 le!)
