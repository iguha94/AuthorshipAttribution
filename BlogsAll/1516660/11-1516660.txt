oh my GOd! it has been so long since i last updated my blog!! Argh.....can't blame me though... imagine this, a rather skinny girl having to wrestle her brother, who is roughly 2x her size, every night just to update her blog, by the time she gets it she is like too tired to write ~~lolx   wad ever it is, i'm back and that is all that matters rite?? anywayz, during the period of my absence online, i got my writing mojo back. wrote quite a lot of lame poems but misplaced them ....most of them are really sad though.......... dunno y but i've been kinda down lately. very melancholy, very sombre, very unlike me. its all about dead and lonliness....very sad. that's one of the reason y i refuse to publish them, life is beautiful and bright, ppl have their own problems to handle, shouldn't make life even darker by letting em read my stuff ....  for some reason, i think i'm a very dark person. i can't seem to write about anything happy. i read so of the stuff i wrote some yrs ago....they are so dark they scare me. i think i've got an identity crisis and split personality....haven't been reading the newspaper since i started work. actually haven't been reading anything since i started work... my brain is deterioating... not reading oso has its plus points, at least i wun think so much...lolx contradicting myself...i wanna think or i'll go crazy and become senile but i dun wanna think too much in the process lest' i trouble myself too much over things that aren't to be
