         Woop! Today's National Day, where Singapore celebrates it's 38th birthday! Happy Birthday, Singapore!   Woke up at 8++ today. such rare moments, for Saturdays are usually spent waking up real early to go to choir. Sigh. Graduate liao, so many free time! Plyed FFIX there. Didn't make much progress. I got Chooco to ride on! Coolies! Continuing tomorrow. Yeah!  After that, ate breakfast (carrot cake) and watched cartoons till 11.30. Then, I went online for a brief period. Chatted, find FFIX info and ate lunch (instant noodles!).  I went to Wendy's house in the afternoon to do my MT and Physics homework. Well, I managed to complete my MT homework. I lent Wendy my zhuo ye (Major update: I took Wendy's zhuo ye back home! HaHa! Now she has nothing to copy with!  "You idiot!" ). After that, she taught me how to use the FTP program and showed me how to make tables. I am gonna make a temporary page that says something about my site being in construction. Yeah, do that later lor. And Wendy sold me her blog file. YaY! Got a much nicer one. I am decorating it tomorrow! Yep yep!  Came home and bathed just in time for NDP. HaHa! The choir has the fan (the traditional chinese fan) again! So beautiful! I want, and I bet CQ wants too! So jealous of them. Oh! I found out the choereographer is Slyvia McCully again! Yep! She has been choreographing the choir for 9 years! Wow! She's a cool teacher, funny at times, yeah! HaHa! The shows are wonderful. Just don't ask me how the main performance went. I fell alsleep halfway. Yes. What a pig! I woke up just in time to catch Stephanie Sun singing the National Day song for 2003, One United People.   After the NDP, I went to pack my bag for Monday's lesson and came online. Ahh! I think I go work on my website and print out the blog entries le. See ya tomorrow! goodnight all!
