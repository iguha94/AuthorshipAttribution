         Second topic of discussion: Friendship   I got this email from Wendy, which I want to share.  Friendship is a quiet walk in the park with the one you trust  Friendship is when they gaze into your eyes and you know they care  Friendship is being close even when you are far apart  Friendship is hoping that they experience the very best  Friendship occupies your mind  Friendship is knowing that you will always try to be there when in need  Friendship is a warm smile in the winter   My personal view on friendship is:  Friendship is very beautiful. Indeed it is. Friendship, just like love, can make the world go round. Friendships mean everything to me. Everything. Without all those wonderful friends of mine, I would go crazy. Seriously. I was very lonely in my primary shcool life, and sec 1. I used to frequent the library, and I used to walk home alone. It was so lonely. Nobody besides me. I don't ever want to go though that again.  Friends. A very important necessity for life. I can't stress on how much it is. It is very. I will treasure my friends. I know I always will.  I also found out that: There is no place for "yourself" in a friendship. Absolutely. I always kick my interests for myself aside, for my friends. If you only think about the benefits of yourself, then you are not much of a friend.   I also try to help my friends whenever I could. Seriously. Sometimes, they mistook that for "kaypoh". I am sadly depressed. I am not kaypoh. I am sincerely wanting to help them. But what to do? Seeing my friends so depressed, I also feel so depressed. Sigh. What to do? They don't want to tell me.  But overall, I love my friends. I will treasure our friendships together.  Thank you. Every single one of my friends.
