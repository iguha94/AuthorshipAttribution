hrm.....My alternate self took leave today. No angry shout outs or sad poetry today. Feels kinda weird, i mean I'm like so used to that part of me (psst, her name's jade) being around and now that she's off duty, it feels as though a part of me is gone. But no worries, i feel her coming back already, guess she misses me too. or should i say she's troubled by some news she read again....  gotta finish compiling my thoughts before she takes control again..........  Woke up kinda late today, feeling lost because exams ending soon and i gotta worry bout tmr's celebration dinner.......so broke, how to go? Guess i only got myself to blame, my om found out i lost money again and refuse to give me anymore for the rest of the week, making me totally broke lor....  What to do??  Still got an exam tmr but i practically wasted my whole morning and half the afternoon doing nothing. How pathetic is that?? Anywayz, Cherie found a job too and she's starting in Dec, i'm starting mine next Wednesday, man, its gonna be so tough ... On top of that, i jux realize that i'm gonna have a huge problem soon.  i promised kin hock i'll help him with tutoring but my work is kinda long hours......how the hell am i gonna fit the lessons in?? i dun wanna go back on my word, its not the best solution to anything... hrm, nvm, i'll work out something.
