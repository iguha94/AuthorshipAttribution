         NINE TO FIVE   " 9 TO 5"   -   I know there is a movie of this title, I see Dolly Parton in this movie and that comediane with the straight hair and bangs and wide mouth. Her name skips my mind. But I should know her, because I remember she even starred opposite John  Travolta (one of my favorites -) oh got it Lily  Tomlin.  I keep confusing myself that Melanie Griffith was in this film when in fact Melanie was totally all by herself with Harrison Ford in   Working Girl.   I have not been sleeping as early as I want these days. I keep flipping channels and I find movies that get me  interested and I get to watch them till end around 2:00 am. One night it was THE GIFT ,  and then MONSTERS BALL  ( Halle and billy Bob). I must admit they were pretty good.  the irony of it is the girls have been calling me to  out and I have been  making excuses not to go, it's cold, just want to rest (actually too lazy).  And then I realize that if I did go out I would just be walking in the door at 2  and not in bed since 8 and  realizing that I am still awake by 2.   But then I guess it's different when you decide between spending time with yourself rather than with others.
