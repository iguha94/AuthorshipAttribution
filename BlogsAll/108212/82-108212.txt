         well, i'M so torn rite now bec the nursing schools are just fucking me big time in texas. i'M in vegas now, and i'M trying to check out the nursing schooLs here. *sigh* it feels as if i'M blocked by waLLs every which way i go. mom is freakin' out on me bec i mite move here 2vegas, but my cousin MicheLLe, the one who's been beggin me 2move-in w/her is such a disappointment. evn if she knew i wuz cmin here, i havent done a thing for the past two days. iVe slept on the floor and iVe slept w/a guy, her #2boi's hausmate, and i hafta share his bed w/his dog. i'M at my couzin Jon's haus and thank the good Lord he has the net and a room of my own... and a nice bed! i'LL write my article asap kc i wont bee goin 2schooL anymore. i'M heLL-depressed rite now, but there's nothin eLse i cLd do. the teacher is refusing 2give me and 6other peopLe the exam, which counts 40%of out finaL grade, bec we were 5mins late-due2 car accident blocking the freeway exit &we were stuck in traffic. that basicaLLy means i faiLed the course. ders nuttin d dean can do, bec we signed a contract w/our teacher there's NO exempxns w/d rules. AND if i faiL one nursing class, i'M out of the program. AND it's 2late 4us 2drop. plus, accdg 2texas laws, my 1997 prerequisite classes have expired bec it's been 5yrs. ergo, i must retake them again. it's just aLL bullshit. i'M prayin 4things 2get better and this is supposed 2b my yr, but so far, it aint goin as i pictured it. i'M sooo tired of schooL. i'M soo tired of living w/my mom. i jst dunno enimore =o(
