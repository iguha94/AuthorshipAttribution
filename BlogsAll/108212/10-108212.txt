         That's pretty funny, Glee !     Well..&nbsp; Well..&nbsp; Well..&nbsp; Guess who can't sleep?&nbsp; You guessed it ! &nbsp; I've been tossing and turning all night.&nbsp; I'm actually amazed that I didn't wake Brian up as I got off the bed.&nbsp; I hope he doesn't wake up from the keyboard noise.&nbsp; He's kind of a light sleeper.&nbsp; Thank God that the computer is now in a different room !     I've got lots of stuff planned for today.&nbsp; Two loads of laundry, one load of Dryel, dishes (hopefully only one load), got to the bank to do a change of address (yes, I've been procrastinating), pick up paycheck and book from Pat (lady on my team at work) to Jodi Anderson (lady on Brian's team at his work that used to work at Spiegel) that I left at work (I forgot it as I was leaving the other day and I forgot it again yesterday ~~> Can anyone say Gingkoba?), go to Walmart to get refill on birth control, stop by Brian's work to bring the previously mentioned book (if I remember), watch  Thirteen Days  with Brian, go to Brian's parents' house to help assemble Logan's present and for supper, meet Misty (with new dance partner, Jorge) at swing club, return movies ( Monkey Bone ,  Down to Earth  and  Thirteen Days  ~~> I'm telling you, between movie rentals and new movies, Brian and I watch about five movies a week ! )..&nbsp; I think that's everything.&nbsp; As forgetful as I am, I can't help but feel like I omitted something.&nbsp; Oh, well..&nbsp; Perhaps it wasn't  that  important.
