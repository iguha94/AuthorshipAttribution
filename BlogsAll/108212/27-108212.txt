         Reply to Ching's post: No, she doesn't pop microwaveable popcorn. She has to get fresh popcorn kernels from the Solono County's crops. My friend Amy has an opinion about everything. She doesn't settle for less, if she doesn't have to, when she knows "the best" is readily available. Weird, huh?     My sister's wedding and reception were both a fabulous success. The food was wonderful, the reception location was romantic with a huge window view of the city and the bay at night, and the entertainment was spectacular: the groom serenaded the bride singing a punk rock cover of the punk rock band's  cover of the 80s song "Glory of Love." We, both bridesmaids and groomsmen, were all surprised he had it in him. Turns out it was his dream to sing in a rock band. The wedding cake was a simple round two-tier angel food with strawberries in the middle. It was decorated with red rose petals and the bride/groom topper was two anime acting-figure characters. I said an impromptu speech about the bride and groom in front of 300 guests. We had guests fly in from Canada, L.A., and the East Coast.   The newlyweds honeymooned in a bed-n-breakfast in the Napa Valley.   They opened their wedding presents yesterday. For some reason the couple has more knife sets than would be considered practical. They also have two disco balls--yes, that was on their wedding registry. Still, it's one too many. I noticed their bathroom and kitchen stuff were either black or silver or grey. I have a strange feeling my brother-in-law has taken charge of the interior decorating. *sigh* Well, my sister and her husband are living in the house my sister and I grew up in as children. (My mother, father, aunt, and I live in the carehome, the place of my mom and aunt's work.)
