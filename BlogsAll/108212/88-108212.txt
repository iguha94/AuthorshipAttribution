         Wow! I had no idea that DVD compressions were different for the DVD media that are out there.  I think the movie companies have their hands on the higher end compressions.  Like I always say, where there's a will there's a way.  If you cant save it to one dvd maybe theres a way to save it into two dvd's.  I've gotta research this...(pulling out the pad paper and pencil: note to self, find out how to hack 7GB dvds to compress it into a 4 GB dvd.)  In other events, I am assuming you people watched the EMMY's last night.  I of course again didnt win the vicarious "Best Stalking via the Comments Section" which was won by   Gnome-Girl .  I also didnt win the prestigious "Best Supporting Geek in a drama" category which was won by   Chris .  Oh lets not forget the new category that just came out this year, "Most Desperate Losers in need of Repros" which was unanimously received by a number of people coming into   Kinko's  all day today thinking they can get their last second projects completed in an hour.  If there's anyone out there that is in major need to watch some flix is me.  So yeah, I want those movie coupons.  Heres my   email .  How much are they?  Wow Jay, if you think April's Xanga page was all that, you should check out   Friendster  too.    And BTW I still cannot view the GROUP BLOG after I post and publish.  Oh well, I'll just post the   LINK HERE  for all to use when they post and publish
