         Thanks, for the HTML tags. I really need to brush up on them. My room is such a mess right now. It has my poetry, massage supplies, books, puclicity flyers, newspaper articles and clippings, clothes, etc. ARRRRGH! I really need to get organized. I'm so busy lately.   I used to average about 2 therapeutic massage clients a day. Now, I only get about one a week. I got in a car accident a coupla weeks ago. A teen driver rearended me. I now see the chiropractor 3 times a week. I got two job opportunities working at various spas, but because of my tight schedule, lack of reliable transporation, and my whiplash injuries, I had to decline job interview opportunities. Send good thoughts my way for speedy recovery, and hopefully I will be able to be able to build my therapeutic massage practice again.    After my book tour, I'm actually thinking about acting. Yeah, I saw a group of AIDS health educators performing a play called "Secrets." They all were over the age of 22. When I told them I want to join their cast, they got real excited. I told them that I have my book tour to finish and I have a huge event to produce so it will be a while before I can commit.    Oh, I have an opportunity to audition for an HBO spokenword/slam show. The only thing is that they are asking for 18-30 y.o. poets. I just turned 32. Martha, the hostess of the Listen & Be Heard open mic where I regularly read at, said that was "rude and ageist" and that I should "lie." Dammit, I look like a kid!
