         The P.O.S. crashed in our branch today. POS stands for the Point Of Sale computers or what other companies call the cash register. At about 3pm E.D.T. the POS started hashing out error codes at each station. It happened at the height of a rush at the store. We could not ring in any sales and the line in front of the counter was growing impatient. I quickly had to turn the customers out to express and having them utilize express pay cards or inserting their credit cards on the ep card readers. There were problems when they had to puchase outputs on the oversize bw plotter and the sony picture stations which were not put on the express pay system. I had to manually bill them by writing up receipts and stapling our business cards on the receipts. This could not have happened at a better time. We have 2 litigation jobs in house that have to be completed by tomorrow. I had to fan out one of these projects to the Bayside Kinko's so that it could be completed.   I also lost my cool today. Tre came in late again and inavertedly turned on one of the POS's while someone from tech support was reloading the back up from the previous day. That put a damper on our backup time by a whole hour. I flipped and started slamming a corrugated box on the kitchen counter in the witness of Tre who was shocked to see me in that state of mind. When I vent out my frustrations in a physical way, I often go overboard. I really feel bad about this action. It could ideally give me a write up from Jaba, who is on vacation, and can also be grounds for me getting fired.   We will have to see what happens tomorrow...
