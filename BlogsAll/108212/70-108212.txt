            ANALYZE THAT  Hey, Merry Christmas to you too Jane!&nbsp; I'm surprised to see you blogging here!&nbsp; Usually your posts are on the  SMEAGHE blog ..&nbsp; I mean, I love that you posted here!&nbsp; I wish you would post a message more often!&nbsp; You have to come up with a movie title that begins with the last letter of the movie title in the previous post next time, though!&nbsp; LOL!  Does anyone ever go to  my other blog ?&nbsp; Just curious.  Anyway, this will be a mass shout-outs and holiday greetings post (at the risk of sounding really Asian-like)..    Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to my  JENTLENESS  family:  Yen ,  Stephen ,  Angie ,  Alyssa ,  Mark , all the peeps at  BITS  and  Fragments  and, of course, to our gracious host  Jen ;&nbsp; to my  GOLDEN SUSHI  family (specially the most frequent bloggers:  Daf ,  Net ,  Pia  and to my very own  mom  who has been really active of late (Me thinks she's hooked on blogging!); to my  SMEAGHE  family; to my Westar Energy family (Katie C, Sarah J, Lindsey, Ashley, LaKresha, etc); to my best friend  Sheryll ; to my real-life family ( Mom ,  Dad ,  Jen  and  Logan ,  Mom and Dad Brubaker ,  Grandma and Granpa Brubaker , my brother-in-law  Kevin , Mama Precilla and Papa Osing, Mama Iyay and Papang Joe, Tito Ope and Auntie Jess and Gladys, Tito Moy, Tito Cy --- Omigod I better stop now because the list is never-ending!); and to (last but not least) my wonderful hubby  Brian  who even though he doesn't blog regularly will write really good blogs that are worth waiting for.     If I forgot your name -- I STILL LOVE YOU! -- my mind just isn't working properly right now.  Have a wonderful holiday season everyone!!!
