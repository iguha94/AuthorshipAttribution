         Welcome, Cel ! &nbsp; I'm glad to see that you're finally.&nbsp; We hope to hear from you soon.&nbsp; Jhayne has already posted a couple of messages.&nbsp; I think she's getting the hang of it.&nbsp; Much thanks to Sheryll for helping to get Jhayne connected.    Anyway, I thought I'd let you guys know (if you have not visited the domain --   http://www.goldensushi.net  -- yet) that we offering FREE EMAIL (you@goldensushi.net) and FREE HOSTING (http://www.goldensushi.net/~you) to all Golden Sushi members.&nbsp; Let me know if any of you are interested.&nbsp; Since I've got paid hosting and quite a bit of space, I figured I should share the wealth.&nbsp; There's no room for greedy people here.    The bad news is, you have to have some knowledge of HTML and FTP in order to use the space because I don't have a web editor (learn to use Notepad, gosh-darn-it ! ) or a web upload utility available for you.&nbsp; If you want to learn or need help, do not hesitate to holler.&nbsp; My inbox is always open 24/7.&nbsp; If you don't want to FTP, but would like to create your own web pressence -- I highly recommend  Brinkster .&nbsp; They give you 30MB (that's a lot of space, I promise you).&nbsp; They have a user-friendly web interface that allows you to upload files through your browser.&nbsp; No online editing tool, though.&nbsp; As far as creating your pages, you are on your own.&nbsp; Sheryll can help or I can help -- if you've got any questions.    Other news, Brian has purchased his own domain also (http://www.virtualdumpster.com/ -- it's not up yet, but it will be in a week).&nbsp; He'll be offering FREE EMAIL also.&nbsp; As for HOSTING, I think he'd decided to charge for it.&nbsp; The pricing that he was thinking of was very reasonable, though.&nbsp; So it's not like he's going to be asking an arm and a left for it.&nbsp; We'll keep you up-to-date on that.    Yesterday was a lot of fun.&nbsp; We went to our first pre-marital counseling session.&nbsp; It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.&nbsp; It was kind of nice actually.&nbsp; We talked about how Brian and I met and our families etc.&nbsp; We took home this booklet and we completed it last night.&nbsp; We're going to go over our answers in next week's session.&nbsp; Some of our answers were different, but I still think that Brian and I are totally compatible.&nbsp; No quiz or survey or test will change my mind on that.    We went to see  The Time Machine  right after.&nbsp; I loved it ! &nbsp; I love Guy Pearce ! &nbsp; He is so awesome ! &nbsp; It's hard for me to get into all the details, but I really enjoyed the movie.&nbsp; I'm not usually into sci-fi because it's all so implausible -- I just find myself questioning everything throughout the movie..&nbsp; This one was different, though.&nbsp; They really got me to buy it..&nbsp; That, my friend, is quite an accomplishment.&nbsp; I love that everything happened in the span of a week.&nbsp; I love the simultaneous time overlay in the ending.&nbsp; It was great !     After that we went to meet mom at the bowling alley.&nbsp; I offered to watch Logan while she bowled so she could play without distractions.&nbsp; Brian was excited about playing with Logan, too.&nbsp; We don't get to see him very often.&nbsp; I guess that's all for now.&nbsp; Happy blogging !
