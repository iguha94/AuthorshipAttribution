         Congrats to dad for finally ditching is old Ford Ranger, biting the bullet and buying a brand new car.&nbsp; He's now driving a more stylish, more reliable 2004 Toyota Corolla.&nbsp; We'll be checking it out this Saturday.&nbsp; Of course, mom's car is still much nicer.&nbsp; It's a Toyota Highlander SUV they bought brand new, around this time last year, right before my wedding.&nbsp; This is typical for Filipino households.&nbsp; The woman always has the better vehicle.&nbsp; They were actually thinking of getting a Toyota Tundra for dad (perhaps because he is partial to trucks) but my always pragmatic parents thought that it would be wasteful to drive a Tundra to and from Houston because all of the mileage will depreciate the value right away.&nbsp; Brian made a really good point when we were talking the shower the other day, though.&nbsp; Trucks are great for moving and dad moves around a lot.&nbsp; I guess he will just have to either borrow mom's Highlander (since it is an SUV and can hold a lot more than his new Corolla) or rent a UHaul trailer.  What I really find amusing about my parents is that the purchase, as usual, was totally unplanned.&nbsp; Matt picked up Logan one day.&nbsp; I guess they saw an Eddy's Toyota (where they bought mom's car last year) commercial ad on tv saying 0% financing on all 2003 models so they thought, we have nothing better to do, let's go check out cars!&nbsp; Of course, there were no more 2003 models when the got there.&nbsp; How that can happen (as big an operation Eddy's is), I know not but they ended up getting talked into buying a 2004 model with 2.9% financing.&nbsp; Not bad but with car dealerships, just like in Vegas, the house always wins.   I'm a little surprised that mom talked dad into it.&nbsp; I know it was her too because she always does this sort of thing.&nbsp; She'll spend hundreds of dollars (perhaps thousands) on furniture without even blinking.&nbsp; She is the impulsive one.&nbsp; Dad used to be really anal-retentive about stuff, researching every aspect and examining every angle before he will even say yes I'll  think  about it.&nbsp; He is more laid back now and more open to mom's whims.&nbsp;  Maybe he has mellowed in his old age (no offense, dad) or maybe he's just given up the fight.&nbsp; If you can't beat them, join them..&nbsp; Right?  Kidding aside, mom tells me that this is a necessity because dad's truck has gone to hell in a handbasket.&nbsp; It's turned into a cash cow for greedy mechanics at the auto repair shop.&nbsp; So it was a spur-of-the-moment necessity purchase, if there is such a thing.&nbsp; Mom was really happy that the dealership gave them $2000 trade in value for the truck without even looking at it.&nbsp; I think they could have squeezed another $1000 out of the deal, considering that the dealer will probably sell it for $5000 on the lot, but hey dad has mellowed and mom has always been easy (no offense to either of you).&nbsp; Lord knows how many imaginary repairs they've paid for on that truck.&nbsp; Just kidding!
