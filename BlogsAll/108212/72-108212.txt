         NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN  -  another James Bond movie  MEDIOCRE -not the movie!  real life.  I receive a notice from the home owners association  that if we all switch to this one trash service, we all will get good rates (about 15.00 dollars less) plus we will be saving our streets from various trash traffic.  I say makes sense, so I signed up for that right away effective Feb 2003, because from my old trash collector I have paid until Jan 2002.  As I will be out of the country in Jan, I decided to call the old collector to inform them to cancell service effective end Jan.  Apparently Dec is too early to cancel (I don't understand) , as in too soon to break up???  (if you are dating) too soon to return an item (that doesn't fit???).  What's too early about that  and told me to call back -when the end of Jan comes.....  Anyways, Ching their no is 5242000,  if you get a bill from them for the next three months then please call them to cancell. Am I alone in this planet who thinks if something is to be done sooner or later, better soon and forget about it.  You'd think if I call them to tell them I want their service in June, they won't  say my call was too soon.  They will find a way to make sure they get my business when the time comes.
