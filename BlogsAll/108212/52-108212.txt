         Ching, I'm okay. Not to fret. Thanks for asking. I went to SF Pride Parade with gf Karen. We watched an outdoor concert at the Latino Stage. I had a chance to see the latina pop sensation Fey perform with very handsome dancers. We both got sunburned. Then Karen broke it off with me once she arrived back in southern Cal. Burned twice in the same summer. Bummer.    Okay, there's a photo and a bio of me at www.cinasphere.com. So can you now please leave me alone about wanting see my photo?j/k   The movies I saw this summer were Men In Black II, Spiderman, Star Wars Episode 2, and Minority Report. I thought it would be unlikely but I actually enjoyed watching Minority Report.I'm looking forward to watching Lilo & Stitch.   I'm still doing the Listen & Be Heard poetry series every Thursday. The L&BH crew is going to produce a live spoken word CD. I will be one of the features, and I'll be charge of marketing. The director of the Downtown Association performance stage requested I sign up for a slot for my poets. I already decided who will be the members of Vallejo Phoenix Rising performance poetry group. (Auditions took place last month.) I got word that I will be receiving the full amount for the grant I wrote for VPR.   My auntie just recently got married and she is no longer working as a staff person for my mother's carehome. Now my mother wants me to be a direct staff person. I feel hesitant, but I know my mother has connections that can give me possible leads for my therapeutic massage practice. (I lost my office space a while back when I broke off my independent contract partnership at a gym.)  And I sure can use the money.     I'm sorry I have not been bloggin in lately. I noticed a few new names. So, I just want to say a howdeeyadoo to Yasmin and Pia. And a longtimenohear to the rest of the gang.    This is Glee signing off... Keep on bloggin--
