         MailerDaemon is the Devil!  Actually, to clarify your email troubles Ching,  I will have to ask you  if you are experiencing this trouble on your work email or your internet providers service?  If its from your email at work, just ignore it and do not at all cost download the attachment that was sent with the md message.  There are several versions of a certain worm that is plaguing email servers that just pulls out random email addresses and sends them msgs or sends out messages that were suppose to be from you but are not necessarily true.  Its already taken over our server which took about a weekend to resolve.  Four weeks ago we could not provide our customers our email addy to send files to because of these worms and viruses.    Recommendations: 1) Create an email filter on your IMAP or POP set up to ignore and delete all messages that has mailerdaemon on it until such mail stops coming to you.( About 3 or 4 days). 2) Make sure that you have the most recent update to your Antivirus software. 3)  Dont download any email attachments. Not even those jpg from your winter vacation. 4) Optional:  Eat some cheese sticks and hold the mayo.  As far as streaming video through the router.  Try configuring the router to have an open port available for the steaming video to come out to the internet.  Actually you might not want to anyway because the cable company or your internet provider might start charging you more money for using up more bandwith than what you're allowed to have under normal situations.
