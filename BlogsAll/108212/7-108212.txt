           Note - tried posting this yesterday - firewall probs.  Here goes again...    Present!      I should be a grandfather by next week... Jessica's as big as a house.      Work's a bitch - mandatory overtime now through September. Found out today that we're rehiring a friend of mine (who left for greener pastures, then got laid off), and she'll be working for me. So that's cool.      I don't wanna know my score. It's one of the few things ALL the voices in my head agree on. &lt;g&gt;      Two concerts in the last two weeks - Stevie Nicks with Sheryl Crow (opening act Jeffrey Gaines), and Wynonna and her band. Stevie was Stevie - no surprises, really - good band, fun crowd, she and Sheryl work real well together. Wynonna was excellent! Covered a lot of different styles - blues, R&amp;B, rock, gospel, pop-jazz, contemporary Cbristian- not really much country, though there's this &quot;country feel&quot; that's different from other styles (more emphasis on 1 &amp; 3, backbeat a little stiffer - if you care about that stuff) - and that was prevalent throughout. She sang covers of Fab Thunderbirds, Avalon, Joni Mitchell. Had a gospel trio behind her that was excellent, plus a real good band.      Either show's worth checking out. Sheryl Crow's coming back to Michigan without Stevie in a couple of weeks - I love her stuff, but her voice isn't all there live (not just the show we saw - I heard a live CD later, had the same impression). So we'll probably skip it.      Anyone else see any good concerts?      Daf (= Jay)
