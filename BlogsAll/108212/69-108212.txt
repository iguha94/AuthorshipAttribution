          ENTER THE DRAGON  Oh my I almost forgot about greeting my Golden Sushi Family!  Merry Christmas everyone!  I am currently watching TechTV's Call for Helpathon.  Its 18 hours of fact filled Call for Help with Chris Perillo.  I wonder how he will turn out after 18 hours of work.  I know I start acting silly just working 12 hours.  In between this helpathon I will be dropping off my car to get an oil change and an emissions inspection.  Its gonna be a trek since we received about 5 inches of snow yesterday.  I even drove during the peak snow time.  My family spent Christmas day with our Tita Josie.  We opened our gifts there and also sang songs on her new Kareoke machine.  This machine was AWESOME!  Who would have thought that you could have over 200 songs placed inside a computer chip that can be placed inside a microphone!  Did I say this machine was AWESOME?  It had voice pitch control, song speed control, echo effects just to name a few.  It even had a option to add another chip for MORE Songs!  That is Awesome!  My sister, brother in law and I started hogging the mikes after we ate the fabulous food that Tita Josie cooked.  I think the highest score we got was 98?  Yes thats right on top of all this machine does, I also gives you a Score!    Snow driving was a challenge.  My brother in law followed me as I plowed through the snow with my wider tires. He had standard tires on his Accord.  What normally took me 15 minutes drive took me an hour and a half.   Can we start using Tagalog Movies as titles?  more to come...  NET
