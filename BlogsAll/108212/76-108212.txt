          GATTACA   It's an Ethan Hawke / Uma Thurman sci-fi flick.&nbsp; Oh, and Jude Law is in it too!&nbsp; Speaking of movies, we just saw  Treasure Planet .&nbsp; Pretty good.&nbsp; It reminds me somewhat of  Atlantis .&nbsp; Another animated film that I'm looking forward to seeing is Adam Sandler's  Eight Crazy Nights .&nbsp; He's a really funny guy!  Anyway, I have to do some plugs:  the official Derby Class of '96 website  (it's still up after all these years ~ I mean, I've been through chingay.com, chingay.net, no domain and goldensushi.net and it is STILL there).&nbsp; It's run by Ryan of  RyanandMichelle.com .&nbsp; He did a really good job on both websites, too!  p.s. To all you Smallville fans out there..&nbsp; Have you noticed how I went from Lana Lang hair to Chloe hair? (Check out the new haircut, November 30th fresh, in the webcam!&nbsp; Don't mind the Blogger t-shirt which seems to be a favorite of mine lately..)&nbsp; Brian has a thing for Chloe!&nbsp; I told Man @ Planet Hair that I'm growing my hair back long after this cut, though.&nbsp; I think she was a bit concerned that I wouldn't be coming by to see her anytime soon, but I reassured her that I'd return for reshaping quite frequently (this cut was actually a result of the last one growing out of shape).  Brian who is a Master Cuts regular has been trying to convince me to go there for the color weave that I've been wanting..&nbsp; Believe it or not I actually tried to schedule it with Man (even though Planet Hair charges $90 for just the color weave alone).&nbsp; Fortunately she was booked very tight so her schedule allowed time for just a haircut.&nbsp; I'm glad that it didn't happen because I probably would've regretted the extravagant expenditure a few days later.&nbsp; Brian always tells me that I really can't afford to go to the salon that I go to even though I'm convinced that I can.&nbsp; I think Brian's gotten a haircut from my salon only two times and one of those times I paid for it (June Filipino ball 2001: he got his hair cut and frosted, I had an updo and make-up, total cost about $150 for both of us).  For now I think my hair shall remain the same pristine black that it's always been.
