         I was watching the Filipino news program TV Patrol, and I saw the Mayon Volcano erupting. Dang, that's one huge mf! I'm fortunate not have any family members living near that area.      I just got word that my father's brother died from a stroke. He was the only one who did not come to America. I felt sad for him because I think they did not give him a chance most likely because he's blind. I think if he were here, he would have had a lot more opportunities because the government can help provide all sorts of aid for blind people. Then again, I should not judge. I really don't know what his life was like back in P.I.      My poor sister. She has been suffereing from sinus pressure. The doctors don't know why her sinuses won't drain properly. She's going to undergo a cat scan Saturday. I hope it's not anything serious. She's suffering from so much pain she basically stopped taking pain relievers because they don't work.      Nothing exciting is going on today--I'm just going shoe shopping to match my dress. My mother reserved for all four of us to attend my godbrother's wedding Saturday. (Of course, my sister can't go--she has the cat scan.) I wish I did not have to go. But it would be rude not to go since my mom already RSVPed. I just don't know the groom and his family that well. I would feel like I was crashing a formal event.      I went to the Waves of the Word: Movements of Poetry (a benefit for APIA Youth Poetry) Wednesday night. That was da bomb! If you ever get the chance to see the Chicago spokenword group I Was Born With Two Tongues or NYC's spokenword/music crew FEEDBACK, check them out ! I think they do tours and benefits. California, esp. the Bay Area, has its gems: 8th Wonder. All three groups are a must see.
