           YOU'VE GOT MAIL   -  he  he guess this one's a no brainer.   Advance HAPPY BIRTHDAY  to Ching!!!!  We are planning a custume party -so I guess anyone can be who ever they want to be.  I have been pre advised Ching's gonna be a cat, Jenni working on a cleopatra custume as for me I will have my zebra woman outfit (courtesy of Walmart).   I was catching up on my sex on the city ( I have the DVD versions of it),  I watch it for the fashion side, considering these ladies live in New York.  Not just that they live in New York but that they can afford to be fashionable.      But all these girls can use a Dr. Phil (of the Oprah fame).  They ask so many questions - I swear even I could give it straight to them.  Like this Carrie character, who goes out with a Mr. Big, everything good from her point of view but all you have to do is turn it the other way because if you look at this from his vantage point, he is not even interested in introducing her to his mother, after 2 years   of going out.  Fast forward and he ends up marrying a very pretty tall woman he met in Paris (young 25) because take note these ladies from New are 30 something. They think they are so smart (I say naive).  Fast forward some more (7 months after his marriage) he calls her, (drunk) says he is not happy, bumps into her (by accident) says leaving his wife (drunk??) and she tortures herself, finds herself in bed with him again.   Tells him "we should not be doing this", he asks why???  girl unable to answer. I answered for her. Because it makes her feel like shit!!!! On the other hand, as Mr  Big the answer would be  -but it makes me feel good and powerful.   And why would you Miss Carrie make a Mr Big feel that way when you have equal power to find a man who can make you feel as a woman good and powerful yourself...  Yada, yada yada   Thanks to my husband Ric for giving me the DVD"s  (first, second and third season).  I enjoy them immensely.....
