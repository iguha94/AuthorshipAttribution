         JAY -- no kidding!&nbsp; Drew was really a crappy mom in that movie.&nbsp; I hated her character.&nbsp; She was soo stupid!     Chocolat  is very, very good!&nbsp; I really enjoyed watching it.&nbsp; Of course, I had to convince Brian to rent it -- that was a total struggle.&nbsp; His reluctance was the main reason we didn't get to see it in theaters when it first came out.&nbsp; Got to see it on DVD eventually -- we ARE movie buffs after all.&nbsp; Brian admitted that he enjoyed it also afterwards.&nbsp; I had to tease him for giving me such a difficult time.    I think I liked  Original Sin  more than you did, Daf.&nbsp; I'm a big Angelina Jolie fan!&nbsp; And not just of her boobs.&nbsp; That's probably the difference.&nbsp; You got to see a lot of Antonio Banderas' ass in that movie!&nbsp; They got very, very naked..&nbsp; I was totally surprised!    Our most recent rental was  The House of Mirth , based on the Edith Wharton novel.&nbsp; I had to talk Brian really hard into renting that one.&nbsp; He hates period pieces.&nbsp; He only likes them if there's blood and gore.&nbsp; His favorite period pieces?&nbsp;  Braveheart  (which is everyone's favorite),  The Patriot ,  Gladiator , and the like..&nbsp; I think the only exception would be  The Restoration  which does not have blood and gore (unless you consider the plague factor).&nbsp; It's one of my favorite movies and I forced him to watch it.&nbsp; He protested quite a bit, but Robert Downey Jr.'s incredible acting ability made him change his mind.
