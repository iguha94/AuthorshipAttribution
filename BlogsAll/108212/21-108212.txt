         I attended my sister's lingerie party. My sister is practical. She just wants Soen brand cotton briefs from the Philippines. Instead I bought her leopard-print undies simply because she whispered that's what her fiance would want (for her to wear--not him! j/k) The party was fun. I have never seen so many pink striped boxes and bags before. By the looks of it, it seems like most of us got the idea of going to Victoria Secret's.     Anyway, I talked to Liz, her maid of honor. She said that she has three sisters and each of them chose a best friend or a close friend to be their maid of honor. She thinks it's really ought to be the future bride's choice. If you really have doubts about Jen, stick with getting a best friend or close friend you can count on. The maid of honor is like the assistant to the bride. She helps with a lot of the preparations--she plans the bridal shower and what-not. It's not unheard of to have both parents walk the bride down the aisle. I think I saw it done a few times while viewing others' wedding albums.    Jay, great write-up! I wish I was there for that service as well.    There was a great thunderstorm in the Bay Area last night. The flashes of lightning and the roar of thunder frightened my mother. She postponed our appointment with the seamstress. We had a blackout, and we stumbled around looking for flashlights and candles. We listened to my auntie's battery-operated radio. The lights came back on a hour or so later.    Well, that's it for now.     Be good to yourself and each other.    Peace, Glee
