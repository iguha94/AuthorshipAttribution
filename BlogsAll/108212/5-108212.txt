         I have been so depressed lately.  Been worrying about popping the question to Dot.  I has dawned to me that my sister is getting married in a few weeks and this is putting some pressure to me about propossing to Dot.  In all my wonder years, I have been told to set the example, and now sister is showing me a thing or two. Im the eldest of all my siblings and I should be setting examples!  Augh!! Good Grief!!  Whats a man suppose to do?  Dot has also been hinting that she prefers an engagement ring that's worth ten grand!! Looking at my money market account, if I withdraw ten grand that leaves me with nothing.  You are the weakest link, goodbye.    My branch manager now is also putting the pressure on me and my co-worker Mike.  We have to set the example to the rest of the crew.  Either shape up or ship out! he says.  Well, Paul, I say to myself, If you really want to make a difference, why dont you do it?  Note to self... Getting too personal on Blogger.  Just keep it to yourself and hit the stairmaster in the gym....     ~NET    PS Yet to see Final Fantasy.  I will give my review later  this week.  CLerkS was unusual but if you dont get the sarcasm, try thinking of yourself working in a video store with nothing else to do.  I think it shows the realism of people that I know.
