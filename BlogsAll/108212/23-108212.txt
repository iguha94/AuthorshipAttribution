         Speaking of walking down the aisle, my mom, who is not to be out-done, wants to walk me down the aisle (or down to the garden -- because it's going to be an outdoor, garden wedding) too..&nbsp; So I guess she and my dad are  both  walking me to meet my husband-to-be.&nbsp; My sister, who I guess will be my maid of honor (still thinking about it, though), continues to dodge one catastrophe over another.&nbsp; First, she and Matt (the father of her baby) break up; then, she moves back in with mom and dad; a week later, she gets kicked out of the house; mom and dad do not want anything to do with her; she and Matt are friends again; mom and dad begin to tolerate her again (she actually weazeled some jewelry out of mom and my father's laptop -- even after all that went down -- can you say "spoiled" and "manipulative" ??? -- I don't care, though -- whatever will make her get her act back together -- I just feel sorry that her life is all fucked up -- then again, all our lives will be all fucked up anyway once the shit hits the fan -- but then, at least, that's not any of Jen's doing -- then again, maybe it is? -- she always has something to do with shit going wrong); everything seems to be going fine; yesterday afternoon she calls Brian and tells him that she and Matt had a major disagreement and now he refuses to let her see Logan.&nbsp; She is devastated of course!&nbsp; Wait till you hear  why  he's withholding visitation rights!&nbsp;  You'll find out on the next installment of.. "Jen's Fucked Up Life"
