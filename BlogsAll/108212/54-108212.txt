          ARMAGGEDON     Its coming down to the wire.  I opened up the sales report for August and my store needs 3500 simoleons to make the sales plan.  My highspeed color printer is down.  Xerox says they cant get a technician to me until after 5pm.  Meanwhile, I have a project thats on hold which can put me over the top if I can get it printed ($10,000).  It still needs to get laminated and 3 hole drilled.  If Xerox can fix my printer and get the document printed, I can send it to my outsource to complete the auxilliary work and I can complete a banner month at   Kinko's  - sans my boss who is still on vacation.  What proof do I need, to show the powers that be, that I deserve my own empire?     Did I mention its raining cats and dogs out here?  Daf - I never seen Fisher King.  Looks like I have another thing to list on   Netflix  as my next DVD to borrow.  Ching - I read that link about cyberwings.  First time I'm hearing of that site.  So sorry that you have been a victim.  We are all victims of this Shaun's devilish scheme.  Anyway, the weatherman is saying that there might be flash floods for the evening commute tonight.  I might be coming home on a boat.   more to come... NET
