         That's a beautiful story, Vince !     By the way, our barbecue was a blast..&nbsp; Except Richard lost his keys..&nbsp; It was about 1:00 AM.&nbsp; Time to leave, when Richard suddenly realizes that he doesn't have his keys on him.&nbsp; We looked everywhere: on the couch where he and Daniella had been sitting, in his car, on kitchen counter..&nbsp; We looked everywhere ! &nbsp; Then we thought maybe he left it in Jeff's (Jeff = Richard's roommate) truck because they were outside chatting earlier in the evening.    Kevin, who had stayed around also, ended up driving the three of them (Richard, Daniella and Mike = they all rode together) home.&nbsp; Brian and I strip and go to bed.&nbsp; At 2:45 AM we are sound asleep (totally) when the doorbell rings.&nbsp; I didn't even make an attempt to get up.&nbsp; Besides, I was feeling too lazy (and sleepy) to put my clothes back on.&nbsp; Brian scrambles to put his bristols (clamdiggers for men) on.&nbsp; From my half-closed eyes I get a glimpse of Mike as he walks past the door.    "What was that about," I mumble as Brian returns to the bed.&nbsp; "Richard's keys weren't in Jeff's truck," Brian tells me.&nbsp; "They're checking the yard right now."    The following day I find out that Richard had found his keys (thank, God ! ).&nbsp; It was laying in the grass out on our backyard all along ~~ where they had been rough-housing (Richard got a birthday-beating.. It's supposedly a tradition between Richard, Jeff and Mike from way back when.. The three of them went to high school together).&nbsp; Brian paid for it that day.&nbsp; He has to wake up early and be at work by 6:00 AM.&nbsp; He was late.&nbsp; He didn't get in trouble, though..&nbsp; I don't think.&nbsp; At least, I hope not.
