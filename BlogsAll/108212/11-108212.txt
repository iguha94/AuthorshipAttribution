         Okay, okay, The Spark people are the closest to the truth than I like to admit. I'm the one in denial. I think Ching has some idea about my slut ranking. I told her the number on my tally sheet, and she was in some sorta shock. I just think it's weird that I would be gayer than the typical lesbian. I thought it would be more likee I'm straighther than the typical lesbian. Some people (including my girlfriend) think I walk like a guy and think like a guy. And I feel like I'm in drag in a dress.    Speaking of dresses, I'm going to be one of the nine bridesmaids at my younger sister's wedding. My sister got engaged in April on her birthday. When will I get married? When it becomes legal in California. BTW, my sister really liked your hairdo for the Filipino ball, and she and I never saw a dark barong before.    I did not see fireworks, but I heard them go off. Then again, they sounded like gun shots so I stayed at home that night. I think the only highlight of the 4th of July is having a long lost friend drop by and she came out to me.    What's with the Scrabble games, Ching? You just bought a new set? When my girlfriend visited me, we played Monopoly four times in a two week period. Before I met her, I would play one Monopoly game every decade or so. I really believe you get to see the true colors of person once you play Monopoly with them. I watched my sweet, innocent girlfriend turn into a greedy, ambitious, little cheater.   The movies I saw this summer were Shrek and Tomb Raider. Both movies I enjoyed immensely. My sister and her fiance were disappointed with A.I. to say the least. He said, "Speilberg owes me 8 bucks." I've been wanting to watch Memento for a while now. And I can't wait for Final Fantasy.    Ching, what is your main e-mail address?   I thing Web Cloggers is the best name (that I suggested--I'm sure someone else could come up with something better). It goes with  your slogan about the basis of your chingay sites.
