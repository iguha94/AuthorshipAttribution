         Thanks, Ching!    Ching, I have several links and graphics I want to add to my blog. How do I add them to the side column? Is it possible to do that?     I'm so beat. I have gone to three poetry slams. I performed at two of them. I scored a 22 or 24 points out of a possible 30 when I performed "Anxiety Closet" at the Bezerkeley Slam. It was the host's birthday, and I gave him my only copy of the  Watershed  that was the first publication to publish my poem. I just had to let go of it. It was my security blanket for so long. "Anxiety Closet" is now on my friend's Leah's expressions section of her website.   I think I'm rivals with this guy named Jaime Kennedy. He's a three time National Slam poet and self-proclaimed "asshole." Jaime, Geoff Trenchard, and Rupert Estanislao (the last of the latter used to be my bf) are a slam poet group called the Suicide Kings. Jaime hosts the most obnoxious three-ring circus of a poetry slam called Tourettes without Regrets. If a poetry slam was part WWF and part Jerry Springer Show then you will have Tourettes. Jaime and his show was so notorious that he got kicked out of two cities, Benicia and Vallejo. He took his show and his followers to a bigger city called Oakland. Anyway, he's the epitome of what I don't want to be when I grow up.   Rupert is auditioning for my Vallejo spokenword corps called Phoenix Rising. I don't if how much he'll commit to it. He's so busy with being one of the house poets at Tourettes and he goes to almost every slam imagninable.    Is there a poetry slam in your area? An open mic?   My gf did some research and found two snail mail addresses for Oprah Winfrey.  Harpo Productions  P.O. Box 909715  Chicago, IL 60607   Oprah Winfrey Show 1058  W.
