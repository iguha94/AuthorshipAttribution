         Wednesday night I went to Tita Josie's 60th Birthday.  Little did I know what they had in store for me.  I was forcibly volunteered as one of the line dancers in the beginning of the party.  Having only 30 minutes to practice didnt help at all.  Its a good thing it was a country line dance routine. Whew! simple steps really, two steps to the right then three steps to the left all a long facing my partner (not Dot), then twisting the partner around as we both walk three steps faced left. Then two steps to the left then two to the right.Parner moves to her left. I move to my left.  Go to the next partner.   then the cycle begins again.  I dont know the song but afterwards the DJ flipped the beat and switched over to NoDoubt's "Hella Good"!  At this point all the girls in the line dance converged together and did another number and WOW was it a number.  All that bumpin and grinding made it short of a lap dance.  Real Spicy!  The food I mean. The party was at   AKBARS  chique place in the CITY.  I must say Tita Josie throws lavish parties which I will miss.  Now shes about to retire and move home to the Philippines.  When asks where she will stay she mentioned to me that she might stay in AKLAN for a few months.  I never been there myself.  Its my Lolo Mike's home province.  Anyone been there?    More to come  (_)_) ~Net
