          Thanksgiving et al  I had a number of things to be thankful for. One of which is that I get to spend it with Dorothy's Family this year. My Sister and Billy are busy working on their home improvements. Mom decided to spend it in New Jersey. And Joe has his thing this year. I got to go to Syosset with Dot and hang out with Jess and Em for a fun filled night of playing UNO until dinner was served. After a nosh dining on the wonderful menu, I ended up playing games on the X Box with Kim. Then came Black Friday. Dot woke me up and we drove to Best Buy for our early mornin shopping spree. Looked like others had the same MO. The doors were open but there was a HUGE crowd inside the store. Of course the Fuji cam I had my eyes on was sold out even before we got in the door. Allegedly they were handing out tickets for the camera when everyone was in line. Dot and I ended up with a couple of electronic items which I cannot disclose at this time for some of you might be getting these items. I can however disclose the 24" TV we managed to fit in the car. While we were waiting in line for 2 hours, there was this pile of boxes we were leaning against. It was a bunch of TV's that were on sale for 99.99! Needless to say, we took a box and dropped it in front of us since we didnt have a shopping card. It was poinless to have one anyway since you couldnt shop around the store with it. I am taking a break from shopping right now. But I do have one more thing to say before I go DVD X Copy is the SHIZNIT!
