           Hi, I'm here. Actually, I heard that Yahoo Clubs will merge with Yahoo Groups. Groups is real cool, as you know! Clubs  is  a bit limited, though.       Here's what's new with us: Jessica (our Ching-aged daughter) is 8 months pregnant - still living at home, lost her job, boyfriend she's not too serious about. We're hoping the baby's going to settle her down a little - she was REALLY drifting.       Andy (our 17-year-old son) has left home, and apparently dropped out of school, to live at his girlf's parents' house. He's gotten a good job (for a 17-year-old) at a performance auto shop, plans to get his GED and hit community college. They already have a baby together - that made things at home  real  rocky.       Kim &amp; I are having a hard time with all this - we're going to counseling to try to get it straightened out. So far we're hanging in there, though.       Job's going well in that they like me &amp; give me raises, but what a PITA! Had to cancel all my vacations for the next 4 months. Grumble.       Church gig's pretty good too. Can't get a sub, though - so I'm TRAPPED!    Help me! Help me!       Daf (tried some HTML - guess we'll find out if I did it right)
