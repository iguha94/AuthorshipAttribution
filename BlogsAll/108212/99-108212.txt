          If you have been viewing my   buzznet  lately, you may have discovered some published photos of Evelyn my half sister who is currently in the Philippines.  Its a little off topic for this blog but I really need to put some thoughts about it here.  If you ever read my previous blogs in   RadioLand , you may have come across some postings about her.   For the past 14 years, Evy has been the topic of conversation amongs us half siblings of her.  Last March, my brother Adolph went to PI for vacation and our father finally lets out the secret half sibling of ours.  She is such a cutey patootey!  I am still shocked at the fact that I do have a sister that I havent met yet.  I would certainly hope that she will accept us as her long lost siblings too.  Our Dad has led a somewhat mysterious private life after we moved out here to the US.  Now much rumors has been heard about Evy, and I am relieved that she has finally appeared in pictures.   Yesterday, my sister, my brother and I had lunch with our mother and she revealed yet another rumor about a half brother that might be lurking out there.  According to Mom, we have a half brother who was born a year after my sister Marie was born.  Alledgedly, it is reported that our half brother is now living in Thailand somewhere. Its amazing what secrets my family holds from all of us.  I am glad that one secret is out there to be told and resolved.  So what secrets does your family hold?.
