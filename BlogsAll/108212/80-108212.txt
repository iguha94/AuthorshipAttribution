          ROAD XXX   Vin Diesel and a bunch of NSA Agents undercover as college students in ITHACA travel on a schoolbus to stop top secret documents from arriving to a double agent in Texas.  This action packed thrill ride depicts our heroes converting the bus in a 'monster garage' upgrade complete with pontoon floaters and converts into the partyboat to die for. Thats   Cat Schwartz  of TechTV's Call for Help showing off her dancing feet with the digital icon from Microsoft's Plus! Digital Media Edition.  Its amazing what people can do with a blue screen and a digital file these days.  Although Plus no longer comes free with Microsoft's new OS.  It comes with a lot of cool stuff.  If disco dancers arent your thing you can have a tango pair dance on your desktop.  I was chatting online with the TechTV crew when the topic came about the dancing people from a previous show.  So much hype went on in the chatroom about it that the producers of the show decided to release a techtv version of the software only this time it features Cat with the disco dancer and   Chris Pirillo   with the geeky dancer.  If you catch a rerun of the show this monday at 9am EST. Chris will reintroduce the program to viewers along with the product "update". Speaking of shows, I got a hold of some of the pictures from   Chinese New Year  and posted it online.  more to come...  NET
