         Brian and I saw  Lord of the Rings  together, but he went to see  Harry Potter  all by himself yesterday.&nbsp; He got the day off and I had to work ! &nbsp; =P&nbsp; Brian and I both want to see  Hedwig and the Angry Inch ..&nbsp; Thanks for the heads-up.&nbsp; I'll try to rent it here.&nbsp; I hope they didn't ban it or anything.&nbsp; I hate the bible-belt !     All reading recommendations are welcome.&nbsp; I'm working on my sister's copy of  The Unmade Bed  right now.&nbsp; It's an anthology of erotic stories.&nbsp; So far, the stories have been pretty good.&nbsp; I sometimes read to Brian when the mood strikes.    Brian and I bought  The Fast and the Furious .&nbsp; He loves that movie ! &nbsp; The effects were great ! &nbsp; And I  love  Jordana Brewster ! &nbsp; She's so hot !   Wedding plans are slowly creeping along.&nbsp; We anticipate to finalize the guest list and order the invitations next week.&nbsp; My second fitting for my wedding gown is on the 27th -- and I am very excited.&nbsp; The gown fits like a glove ! &nbsp; As though it was made for me.&nbsp; My mom was teasing me about it.&nbsp; She said I can't gain weight between now and the wedding because if I do, my dress won't fit ! &nbsp; It really fits so perfect ! &nbsp; The only aspect that needed altering was the length -- as can be expected.    P.S. My holiday and gift stories are posted in my online journal (  http://ching.i85.net )..&nbsp; There's lots of pictures, too ! &nbsp; Don't forget to check the archives !
