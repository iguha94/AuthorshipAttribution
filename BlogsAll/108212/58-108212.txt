            LIAR LIAR    Drove down to Brooklyn yesterday.  Aside from being home of the Dodgers before they moved to Los Angeles.  It is also home for Em and Werner. Dot's friends since she was a freshman at U.B.*  Anyway, we picked them up and all of us drove to New Jersey to make adjustments to Em's wedding dress at   MarryMeWedding Wedding Palace .  Em tried the extravagant gown which needed some hemming.  We took video shoots of it and Werner promises to convert it to digital format for internet viewing.  Hope to upload it to my briefcase soon.  Anyhoot, the trip came without controversy.  Em caught me and Werner talking about his bachelor romps and she overheard him talking to me about having his groomsmen only paying for half of their tux rentals.  According to Werner, he had the groomsmen try on the tuxes three weeks ago.  Werner also added that in his whims of the vernacular, he offered to pay for half of the cost of the men's rentals - unbeknownst to Em who overheard us talking about this.   Now that the secret is out Em needed a word with Werner.  Apparently, Em and Werner's budget did not inclued the cost of the tuxedo rentals which is normally paid for by each groomsman.  ~sigh.  In the mean time, I snuck out of the gown area at MMW and into the alcove where Dot walk to once she heard the commotion between Em and Werner.  Dot jokingly asked me if Werner was going to pay for her gown too since she was the Maid of Honor.  I shrugged my shoulders in response.    I was  glad that the confrontation did not turn ugly.  Em and Werner made up and now the question comes to mind.  How are the groomsmen going to pay for their tuxes?  Oh did I mention that MarryMe Wedding Palace is owned by Dorothy's Aunt?   More to come....  NET
