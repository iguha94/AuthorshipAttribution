         NEVER BEEN KISSED  So on Mondays I go out bowling and I thought that was enough to break the routine of baby sitting Logan everyday of the week.  Though I enjoy Logan a lot, like our trips to the park -the way he throws his arms around my back and giggles and our library  time together where he gets to be around other  2 year olds.  After Logan leaves for the day in my head I hear him baby talking, which is so cute mind you, it sounds like this  Dhatt one, Dhiss one, Nhooo. Mommma??? Uh hoo?  Dhatt way!! this is when he realizes you are back to your own street and he does not want to return to home  base yet.  It's not enough that I repeat all this things to Ric on the phone (to get it out of my system) who by the way never tires of hearing them, although I know I repeat myself a lot ( i do realize that, after the fact).  So Friday comes and in the desire for adult conversation, goes to the west side, plays mahjong with my favorite pals, Francis, Lenni, Merci -finishes by early morning -not to worry I don't babysit Logan on week ends.  The group plans to be at Tommy's tonight for some dancing--I'll see if I still am up for it tonight, got some housekeeping to do.  Enjoy your week end guys  And Ching My Big Fat... is it out on  dvd  yet????
