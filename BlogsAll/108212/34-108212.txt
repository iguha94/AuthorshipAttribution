           1. What was the first thing you ever cooked?     Spice cake, penuche icing.  From the Betty Crocker Cookbook for Children (1959?)    2. What's your signature dish?   Hot Dogs.  Boiled.  Kowalski natural casing.  Red Pelican brown mustard.    3. Ever had a cooking disaster? (tasted like crap, didn't work, etc.) Describe .  Two serious ones.  One, munchie-induced, where I decided that meatloaf mixed with peanut butter (cooked together) would be real good.  Took one bite, tossed the whole pan.  The other, Christmas dinner, rolled roast and Yorkshire pudding.  My (late) sister was tarnexing silver, and the container slipped - Tarnex all over the Yorkshire pudding.  Waah!!!    4. If skill and money were no object, what would make for your dream meal?   Having my sister back.  The food is secondary, but it'd be cool to relive that one without the Tarnex.  Plus artichokes with drawn butter anf homemade mayo, pickled watermelon, Mom's "book club rice" (with Beau Monde seasoning, Ching!), Kim's Watergate salad, and Dad's spaghetti - a three-day cooking process, the technique buried with him when he died last year.  He put the recipe in a church cookbook once, but left out some details - so his was always special.  No red hot dogs, though.    5. What are you doing this weekend?  Well we're past the weekend now, but I knew what it would be anyhow - work.  70ish hour weeks through March.      Daf
