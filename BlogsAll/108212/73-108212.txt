         RETURN  of a MAN CALLED HORSE  -     So I am again going home to my home where according to the story I almost died of scabies. According to my neighbors and my Mom as a baby I had to be wrapped in banana leaves because cloth would stick to my body.  And I have to be bathed in young boiled guava leaves to sanitize me.    College took me away from this home a week at a time. My allowance was only good for a week, my father was paid weekly. I take a bus to the nearest city, live with one of my relatives and at that time got in one of the best colleges in the province SILLIMAN UNIVERSITY.   My parents were so proud of me getting to college not only was it most expensive at that time, you have to get a qualified grade point to get in. It took the most out of their resources.  My mother who never went as far as high school, married at 16 (as was the norm at that time at that place).  I got the idea and probably understood although not spoken clearly (my mother was afraid it would offend some sensibilities) that I could find a suitable boyfriend in the university and if not that my education will take care of my future.  Pretty much, I think my mother is right.
