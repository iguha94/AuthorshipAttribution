          Nightmare on Elmstreet 5: The Dream Child   Okay guys, I still love  George A. Romero   even though I had to change the movie I poster since it was a recycle.  Man I have to keep up with this blog set.  Anyhoot, horror movie genres takes me back being a teen in   NEWTOWN  High School.  As I was chatting to Ching about it, I mentioned that I am a big fan of horror flicks.  When I was a teenager,  I took a class on movie making and made an attempt at making a horror flick for my final.  It ended up being a comedic spoof according to the reviews of my peers!  My teacher offered me a free class in movie making course had I applied to St. Johns University.  Sad to say, I lost the reels during my move back to Queens.
