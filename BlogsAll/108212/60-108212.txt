          TWISTER   I appaud you Daf!  I want to go back and get my graduate degree too!  =(  Cant find any time right now though.  My sister is a teacher in the NYC Public School System.  She got her graduate in Teaching. Fordam University offered her a fellowship after she graduated from Queens College.  I can say I am proud of both of you and a little envious.  Good luck to you and study well.   In other news, they are preparing a lot of activities for 911.  Gosh, it is hard to believe it has been almost a year since the attack at the Twin Towers.  Sigh, I still think it just happened yesterday.  The Port Authority of NY/NJ is still up in the air about what to do with the WTC site.  Should they erect new buildings over the sacred ground that seems to be a burial setting now for hundreds of people?  In my opinion, they should forget about building there and just put up a park and a monument.  I would rather see new buildings go up around the area than inside the WTC site.   This weekend, after refraining from betting on the Lottery, I bought my first MEGA Millions Lottery ($1).  Results?  I lost of course. Ching, you can be rest assured that I will donate some of the proceeds to GoldenSushi if I hit it. In other stories, I watched the GREEN MILE tonight with Dot. I had no idea that it was derived from a Stephen King novel!  Big surprise for me.  Of course once I found out I began noticing the usual corelation to King's other stories.  I am talking about the Jesus Christ/God like theory where King justifies one of the characters as Jesus-like and has the power that overwhelms the other characters.  Another corelation is the event of a "miracle" occuring in the story.  Here it happens a few times.  A very well done movie.  Go rent it on   NETFLIX .    And Finally, for those of you who are jewish, I would like to remind you that this Friday Sept.6 is the eve of    Rosh Hashannah .  Please go to temple...   More to come....  NET
