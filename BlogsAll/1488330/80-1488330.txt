Like many others, after today's small group discussion I have new thoughts on the book Night.  My group spent much of the period analyzing what the main theme of the book was and we came to two conclusions.  The first theme that we noticed was the naive/optimistic attitude the Jews had towards the Germans and the treatment they would receive in the events that led up to being sent to Auschwitz.(sp?)  The basis behind this theme most likely comes from the strong faith Jews had in God at this time period.  Even after being sent to the concentration and experiencing the cruel treatment of the Germans, Jews still had an optimistic view stating "God must be testing us."  Although Weisel himself begins to lose faith in God, many Jews still believed God was "just testing them."    The second theme my group noticed was individualism in the concentration camps.  Because the happenings at Auschwitz are so horrible, they begin to mold the spirit of many of the prisoners, Wielsel in particular.  This theme is best shown when Wiesel's father is being beaten severely by a crazed guard.  Instead of Wiesel becoming angry toward the guard, he instead is angry at his father for getting in the guards way.  Wiesel, like many others, lose their ties with family and friends in an effort to "fend for themselves" at the concentration camps.   These are the two most prominent themes my group saw in the book, are we missing a big one?  -Pat
