As far as I know, Kailie Veys had the highest multiple choice score with an adjusted (incorrect guess penalty included) score of 23/43.  Sorry if I betrayed her trust in this, but I'm proud of her accomplishment.  On to class participation; I don't think bribing responses is the way to go.  Everyone comes out of their shell, some of us are fortunate to have expatriated earlier, but sometimes forcing someone to respond only delays their comfort.  The best possible scenario is to create an environment where the shy can feel that their thoughts and feelings will be appreciated.  Many people have expressed to me that what they have to say they don't feel other people want to hear; that their thoughts aren't on the same level as the "intellectuals"; that they feel stupid with what they have to say. While there isn't anything that can be done about those angsts, for those that don't feel confortable contributing; know that you needn't worry or feel judged.  Anything that can be contributed adds to the formation of other thoughts and truely helps a discussion.  Lastly; some of those questions in those Peterson tests are so damn frustrating and often times ridiculous.  There should never be a scenario where one must choose between "argue" and "dispute."  They're the same thing!!!  In history, the Fed either "raised interest rates" or "discouraged borrowing."  All the Fed does is control interest rates and inflation, so the answers are the same!!!  Traditionally, the practice tests are harder thant he actual tests.  For a potentially more accurate representation of your score, you can take old tests that were prepared by the college board, accessible at www.collegeboard.com.  Find the AP section, and we're taking AP Lang, not Lit, so be wary.  Once again, good luck on the test!  Love, Rob
