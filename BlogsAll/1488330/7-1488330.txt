Good Morning...Thomas I think the segregation process is a fascinating story. It appears that all the efforts in the sixties may have been futile because our society is segregated based on economics and race.  Racial and ethnic segregation has been a phenomenon from the beggining of America's story.  The Irish, Chinese, Italians, Koreans, the Russians immigrate and create communities.  It seems like the etnic cultures eventually  "melt" into mainstream society after a generation or two  but people with racial differences haven't.  Then their is the Native American story where they were placed in communities together for convenience and their own preservation.   During the seventies there was a movement to desegregate called "bussing".  You see an example in the Denzel Washington movie Remember the Titans.  It failed miserably.  Now with "No Child Left Behind" legislation allows for students to leave their failing school to attend another.  You tell me - where would all the students from Skyview go if it failed?  It is funny - when I was in school we were deemed "The Nation at Risk"   - Regan administration.  Now it is NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND...  I am getting to ready to read your prompts...I will post some information on how you did as a class.  A good thing to examine to finish your studies of modern time is to take Kennedy - Camelot, Johnson - The Great Society, Nixon - Back to Normalcy,  Carter - ? and Regan administration and make sure you look at what they stood for politically, on domestic and foriegn policies...Watergate, Opec, The Iran Contra Affair, The Camp David Accords, Reganomics, Star Wars...  I am working on a review...
