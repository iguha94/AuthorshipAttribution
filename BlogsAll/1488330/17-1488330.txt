Being gay is not morally wrong. I don't understand how people can say this. It doesn't make any sense to me. I never realized how many people have "problems" with gay people until I moved to Washington. It really makes me angry and I just fill with sadness. I've been around gay people my whole entire life. There is nothing anyone can tell me that would make be believe that being gay is wrong. It's so hard for me to debate this issue, because I believe that it should not even be an issue. The fact that people I care about can not legally marry the person they love infuriates me.  Does God think it's "right" to be gay? Is God ashamed at my talented intelligent cousin for being gay? Has she been a sinner her whole life just for being gay? Should she be looked down upon for being gay? Well she is. And she is terrified at what the reaction of other people will be if they find out that she is gay. Responding to Clark's questions about the effect of personal rights and civil liberties on presidential elections I think that is has great relevance. Bush is against gay marriage. This is what swayed my vote. If I was born 12 days earlier I would not vote for Bush. This may seem like a stupid reason to decide how to vote, but it's reason enough for me. This is how I feel. I can not rationally debate this topic because hearing the opposing side just breaks my heart.
