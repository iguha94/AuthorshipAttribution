It is funny that you drive on a parkway, and park on a driveway.  Also, I get high on a freeway, but freebase on a highway.  Curious.  Anyway, the Mariners have so much potential.  Promising start last night by rookie Clint Nageotte (pronounced na-zhot) who gave up 0 runs in six innings.  The largest Mariner problem has been synchronizing offense and defense (one has one f, the other has two).  Mariner's starters Joel Pinero and Freddy Garcia each have excellent ERA's, yet abismal records.  Lastly, the Pistons can beat the Lakers, and I see the finals as a tossup.  Anyone that thinks the Lakers are going to coast by anther lame-ass eastern conference team has another thing coming.  That thing is the ridiculously powerful Wallace and Wallace combo, Tayshaun Prince guarding Kobe, and my boy Rip Hamilton who took a page out of Jesse T's book and wears the Hannibal mask on his way to being the Piston's postseason leading scorer.  I prefer my TP hanging under, and I'll fight that to the death with Biblical references to back it up.  Love, Rob  P.S.  To all you concerned little kiddies in blogger land, Mary and I are good friends and remain to be good friends.  Last night we saw the Presidents of The United States of America play the Rose Festival.  I can say with 100% confidence it was the best concert I've ever seen for $5.  Long live Lump, Kitty, Peaches, and The Groovin Postman.
