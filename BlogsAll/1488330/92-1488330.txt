First of all, I have to say that Pat you couldn't explain Harry Potter any better.  Something about the plot captivates the reader, but I have never stopped to think about what it could be... How could I when I wasn't even able to stop to put them down?  Being a person that has read all of the Harry Potter books countless numbers of times, everytime I read them I pick up on another clue that has a link to a later point in the plot.  You don't even understand how excited I was to realize that Moony, was because he was a wearwolf, Wormtail was because he was a rat and had a tail like a worm, Padfoot the dog, and Prongs was the stag.  I seriously set down my book and was amazed... Maybe it was a little more obvious for others, but when different things in the book all of a sudden click and come together and you get the feeling that a light bulb just came on, its irreplaceable.  That's why these books are good for all ages, younger kids wouldn't necessairly make all of the connections but the mere plot and setting of a magical place that all of us wish we could be a part of would be enough to draw them in.  While adults and teenagers are able to make all of the small connections that makes for a thrilling read. As you can tell, I'm absolutly in love with Harry Potter, and June 4th is marked on my calender! I can't even wait...  Now for a more serious side, Ryan I can see exactly what you mean about Their Eyes Were Watching God.  It definitly focuses on how money and status are not everything in a relationship and you can't "buy" love.  Although it's always said, but it's true, love only comes on its own.  Janie could have had anything she wanted when she was with Jody, but the love was not there.  However when she was with Tea Cake and didn't have a big house and everything else she was never happier. It just goes to show that love is the most important part of relationships and nothing can replace it.   - Rachel Penny
