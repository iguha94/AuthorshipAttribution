Sorry, but I had to post this poem I found in one of the practice tests I have been taking. I really like this test because of the fact that a lot of the experts that they give for analysis are actually really interesting to interpret and are great works of literature:  Virtue George Herbert (1593-1633)  Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,      The bridal of the earth and sky; The dew shall weep thy fall tonight;      For thou must dies. Sweet rose, whose hue, angry and brave,      Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye: Thy root is ever in its grave,      And thou must die. Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,     A box where sweets compacted lie; My music shows ye have your closes,     And all must die. Only a sweet and virtuous soul,     Like seasoned timber, never gives; But though the whole world turn to coal,     Then chiefly lives.   Just a couple of questions for practice:)  The subject of the poem is: a) mortality, b) immortality, c) the beauty of nature, d) the impact of evil,      e) the essence of goodness.  The speaker conceives of the world as: a) ending in ashes, b) repeating the cycle of birth and death,       c) having the strength of "seasoned timber," d) eternal, e) being the secure dwelling of humanity  I am looking forward to frisbee tomorrow; I have to agree with Frank that sometimes it is just better to simply relax and take your mind off all the fidgeting and worries. By the way the answers to the questions are: e and c.
