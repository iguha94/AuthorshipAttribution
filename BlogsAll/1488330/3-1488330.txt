Very insightful comments...I wish more students would take the time to think about what they learned - you did a nice job synthesizing the information and taking it to formulate your viewpoints on the time period. Nice procees - and you allowed me to see it which makes it more fun.  I hope others are wrestling with the information to help them support their understanding of the world.  That is the best way to go about learning history - there is no way you can remember everything but the more information you acquire will help you formulate your own viewpoints.
