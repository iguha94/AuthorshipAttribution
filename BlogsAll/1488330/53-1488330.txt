Rob, what you will be doing is unprecedented, unique, and first of its kind.(For that matter you can patent this ingenius idea.......JK.....or at the least claiming your originality of that idea as your intellectual property).   But seriously, if I interpreted your message correctly, I think core concept is to get more young people our age involved in politics, the political process, and especially how the political process works in a democratic society - with the funamentals manifested in the act of voting. We all realize the age group of 18-21 represent the lowest percentage of elligible voters that actually vote in an election. For some odd reasons young people our age just does not care about policies of our nation(Heh when there is a draft I bet a lot more people will vote then, but then again it's too late by then).   Youngesters, take your legitmiate part of control over the government!!!!!!!! We do not want the same old/senile/retired generals and shrewd politicians dictate our lives and draft us to be killed in some unknown regions of the world without our consent!!!!!!!!!!  I support the statement that those who do not vote does not deserve complaints.   THUS............GO VOTE, AT ANY OPPORUNITY YOU CAN.......AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION A TASTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS!!!!!!!  TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR YOUNG LIVES AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE THROUGH THE ACT OF VOTING!  And finally, do we have an end of year AP Party/Farewell to Ms.CLark Party soon?
