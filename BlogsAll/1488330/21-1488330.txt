I agree with Natalya.  I don't think that a group of people (aka the government) can impose their beliefs on another group of people.  On the issue of GM, it is ridiculous to say that two people who love each other and are willing to make that kind of commitment to each other can't because said people are both of the same gender.  Also, I think that the "slippery slope" argument is stupid.  Just because I see two women getting married on TV, I'm not going to go out demanding all kinds of other pointless things like the right to marry my cat.  And as for abortion: while the idea of killing babies (or fetuses that could potentially be wonderful people someday) really bothers me, I don't think that I have the right to tell my friend that they can't have an abortion.  It was interesting because I went into class set on the opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade, and left class with the opinion I just stated.  Finally, the fat kids.  I really don't know what to think.  On one hand, I think that taxing junk food is a little extreme.  But on the other hand, children are ridiculously occupied with Doritos and Halo, and do absolutely NOTHING.  But how could the government take a role?  They obviously attempt to control what is being served in schools and make it nutritious, it just as obviously doesn't work (look at Skyview's menu).  P.E. classes are ineffective.  And the government, while they can run things like schools, shouldn't be allowed to dictate what people eat at home.  I guess the best solution is the one Tyson mentioned, where the government looks at what corporations are putting in their foods and look for healthier alternatives.   OK, I'm done now. If there is a flaw in any of my arguments, I'm sure someone will let me know. Bye.
