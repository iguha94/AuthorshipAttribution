You are certainly welcome Natalya. I'm glad you read what I had to say.  For me, I never trust numbers unless I know the source in which those numbers come from. Who was surveyed? What questions were asked in regards to the survey? There are a lot of ways numbers can be manipulated, which, as a result, can sway the data in a way that supports an idea. I rarely rely on percentages, ratios and what-not unless I know how the data was brought up. For example, I saw on the back of a bus in Portland the other day that read on the rear "249 cars are at home because I am on the road". How do I know they didn't make up the number? Most people who ride the bus don't even own a car! So, by counting the number of people who ride the bus everyday for reliance on the accurancy of that particular data isn't gonna cut it. That is the type of BS statistic that makes me question every form of data I hear, unless I know what the source is. So NPR is going to need to present their resources for their data before I trust what they say.  I have to ask Nat, how is it that you are somewhat religious, but don't even know if religious is real? Interesting. In regards to the bible, those who believe in the judeo-christian religion go by the New Testament, the place where Jesus's teachings are, which is the place where the religion originated. The New Testament is the place where Jesus speaks of homosexuality. And don't call people hypocrites because they don't fast or don't follow the Ten commandments strictly. That is part of the Old Testament. And it seems to me that you think that fasting and ten commandments stuff is all you think the Christian religion is. It seems to me that you're taking the standpoint of christianity very objectively, in which you think that we point fingers at the gay marriage issue and say "you're sinning! you're sinning!". We all know people sin. People who "go by the bible" sin. The Pope has sinned! What I'm saying is, is that as a christian, in regards to the Gay Marriage issue, we're not pointing fingers as to who's a sinner for being gay. It's the fact that those who support gay marraige are trying to take the sacred, holy idea of marraige and turn it into an unholy union. And yes, you may quote me on this is if anyone wants to respond.
