K, well here is what I have to say about the abortion debate that we had in class today...  There are so many factors that contribute into abortion besides just the idea of "killing an unborn baby". There are the ins and outs of foster care, adoption, women's lives, children's live as well as the state that our country is in.  I am religious, though I believe that religion can have no place in this issue. It is fair that everyone can have their own morals, beliefs and religious system, but what about the whole idea of separation of church? Just because "the bible says so" doesn't mean that is what our country should go by. Do you see what I mean?   I have a lot more to say on this issue, though I know there is really no way of winning the argument. Is there really a happy-medium? Because I mean if abortions were to be allowed for only hazardous pregnancies, rape and incest cases, where and how excactly do you draw the line? If it's okay for some women, why not for all? And in the case of pregnancies that are harmful for the pregnant woman, perhaps it is "God's will" that it ends that way? I don't really believe that, I'm just throwing it out there.   Anyway, I would never have an abortion myself, but I wouldn't want to take that right away from any woman who wanted to use it. Afterall, if abortion is against yours or whomever's religion, they will  have to take it up with Him in the end. We're not God. That statement can be taken another way: we can't take away life...but if we can make it, why CAN'T we take it away? And just because someone doesn't support something or even think it is right, it doesn't mean they should force that opinion and ways of life upon other people. That's all for now.   Peace.
