First of all, Corey and Julie, what are you people doing and 1AM and 3AM???? Go to sleep, it's good for you. Wow making food that early in the morning.....Crazy people.   I agree with Hilary's statement of older people generally carrying stereotypical views towards teenagers. One reason this may arise is the fact that teenagers really don't care about politics that much, only around 19% of 18-21 year olds vote! How sad! And then we complain about how the government only cares about healthcare/medicare, and we never get what we want......Well it's because we don't vote!!!!!!  It's really a damaging and detrimental cycle of teenagers not voting, then we don't get what we want, and then we teenagers think we are not important in the society and our vote doesn't make a difference, so then we don't vote......It's bad for our society.   AND THUS, SPEAKING OUT, AND VOTE!!!!!!!!!!! Voice your strong oppositions whenever you feel like it........And don't always let your parents vote FOR YOU...... I believe we should have more of those last friday's discussion types so more people can get involved in politics and research into what our country is actually doing, which directly affects everyone of us when we go to college and worrying about our financial crisis......And maybe military draft.   Everyone of you can start by just going to the schoolboard meetings........It's the first step towards understanding how our nation's bureaucracy works and how their policies directly affect everyone of us.   That's why Rob's honorable plan of sacrificing his vote for the vote of the whole school during the November election is such an unprecedented plan!
