Hey guys, you can add one more to the total # of bloggers, making 19 i think?  Anyway, addressing Tom's point from the essay that Twain was writing for a racist audience doesn't sit well with me.  I'm not disagreeing that there were (and still are) many racists in this country, and probably some of them were fans of the original, Tom Sawyer, but I just don't get the feeling Twain wrote for an audience.  He was already a very successful author who had stopped needing to write for money, so I don't think the bottom line was his issue.  Every example of Twain's writing I've come across challenges cultural norms.  Whether addressing Christianity, poverty, or racism, he attacks each issue with the underestimated weapon of satire.  Flooding the tongue-in-cheek essays and novels with his own opinions, no matter how controversial.  I don't believe that Twain could be writing for a racist audience while openly attacking the Ku Klux Klan, and the entire establishment of Christianity.  If Twain avoided openly expressing Huck's love for Jim to the world, it was to get around his own nagging imperfections in his relations with blacks.  I don't believe that this was as much of a concious effort as Miss Morison claims.  Sometimes things are better off left to the imagination, e.g. the "humbles himself to a nigger" sentence is much more effective in my eyes than, "I'm sorry Jim, I didn't mean to worry you."  Lastly, although Morison's essay was very well articulated and worthy of consideration, it was very much speculation, just as I am writing now. I look forward to posting often and lengthily in this blog, so you've been warned.  By the way, the appeal to the removing "under god" from the pledge of allegiance began this week.  I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on that, as well as on Huck and the recent essay.  Love, Rob
