Congratulations...you have made the blog work.  Your writing is interesting and lively.  It is actually fun to read because you aren't worried about getting a grade but more worried about making a point while entertaining your blogger friends.  I know many of you are tired of the GM issue but I think you made a lot of progress...there is a lot to think and evaluate on this issue...and will continue to be topic for discussion as many individuals continue to press the issue.  Ryan...great insight...I would love for John Kerry to embrace McCaine as his running mate.  Wouldn't that be an interesting team.  However, through the bias and hidden agendas we have made progress in many issues.  The history of America has been a struggle to define ourselves.  Every step of the way issues, beliefs, and ideologies have been challenged.  Howard Zinn has an interesting book called..."You Can't Stay Neutral on a Moving Train!"  He makes a great point.  It is nearly impossible to be completely objective based on your life experiences. However, I do think it is important to challenge yourself to think, listen and learn.  No one has all the answers...  How are you doing on your Democrat V. Republican economic policies? Can you share some interesting websites?  Also I wanted to remind you about the AP Party tomorrow night.  It should be fun.  Bring a shirt, a sharpie and dessert....you may want to team up with a couple people in the dessert bringing.    Good work...your blog is enjoyable to read...keep it interesting and informative.   Many of you seem mature beyond your years.  Gertie
