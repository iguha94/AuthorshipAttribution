I'm a "Mice and Men" kinda guy, and I'm going to agree with Thomas' "it's a comfortable read" quote.  It's mostly dialogue and fun, quite frankly.  Bringing the draft back is a heinous idea to me as well, and it drives me crazy because Bush is not being the president that (lost the popular vote but) we elected.  Does anyone remember the debates of 2000 when W. Bush adamantly and outwardly expressed his distaste for the way Clinton was using the military?  Saying directly that U.S. troops should not be used for nation building in other countries.  Hmm... why does W. Bush want to reinstate the draft again?  Ohh, that's right, it's because he needs more troops to continue his nation building in Iraq.  Afghanastan was a justified war.  I entirely understand why the Taliban had to be removed, and (with international backing) it was the right decision to invade.  What W. Bush told the country the reason for invading Iraq was is SOMEWHAT legitimate because Saddam possessing biological/chemical weapons is a threat to our ally Israel, but that's not the reason he decided to invade.  He can blame intelligence all he wants, but suggesting Iraq had tried to acquire Uranium based on zero evidence isn't the kind of credibility I want in a Commander In Chief.  Now, as the motives continue to change, hundreds of Americans are dead because of a W. Bush lie, and he wants thousands more to risk their lives for a quest he said was not worth fighting before he was elected.  I scoff at those who want to support W. Bush because they believe KERRY flip-flops positions.  The more I think about it the sicker I get.  I might type more, but I'm off to do my taxes, attempting to get back some of the money W. Bush is itching to turn into a deficit.  Love, Rob  P.S.  I need a prom date, so if anyone has any ideas, please feel free to let me know.
