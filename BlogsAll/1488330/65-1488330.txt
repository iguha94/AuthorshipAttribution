My only suggestion to those who want to "study" for AP English test is to take as many practice multiple choice questions as possible, and after you took a couple hundred of them you will probably see some patterns emerge; at least that's what I am planning on doing for the next 5 days. The only problem that I see is that all the practice tests written either by Petersons or Barrons are much harder and some of the questions are totally different from those on the actual AP test, so if you take their practice tests you will probably get used to those author's patterns of thinking and the type of questions they ask and what answers they are looking for, yet it's still a good practice: it helps you to try and think like the writer of the questions and also pace yourself. Last year I was taking practice world history tests and so at the AP test all the questions seemed much easier to answer and I answered all of them in time.   I have to agree though with Thomas that AP English is hard becuase of its subjective questions, I am myself almost never 100% sure on answers, and often those that I was sure of end up being wrong. But I agree with Eren also that essays make up for the harsheness of mult. choice; especially after Mrs. VA gave us the rubric it became much clearer to me what exactly I should focus on including in my essays.   So just practice a few more hundred mult. choice questions;), and review grammar and literary terms.  My favorite questions on our last practice test: 26. What is the meaning of the word "object" (line 85)? a) Feel b) Dispute c) Argue d) Silence e) Save I think Rob was the one to point out the fact that "dispute" and "argue" are too similar to see that much of a difference between the two.
