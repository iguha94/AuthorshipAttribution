I'm 100% in favor of isolating and analyzing those philosophical quotes in the hearts of novels.  My favorite (besides "my mother is a fish") in As I Lay Dying comes from the woman who lays dying.  The quote comes at the end of a chapter that deals with the nature of words- how words and names are used to describe emotions and feelings but they're always insufficient if there isn't first hand knowledge of the experience that the word's trying to describe.  As an example...  "I would think Anse (the name of her husband).  Why Anse.  Why are you Anse.  I would think about his name until after a while I could see the word as a shape, a vessel, and I would watch him liquify and flow into it like cold molasses flowing out the darkness into a vessel, until the jar stood full and motionless: a significant shape profoundly without life like an empty door frame; and then I would find that I had forgetten the name of the jar.  I would think: The shape of my body where I used to be a virgin is in the shape of a            and I couldn't think ANSE, couldn't remember ANSE.  It was not that I could think of myself as no longer unvirgin, because I was three now (had three kids now).  And when I would think CASH and DARL (the names of her first two children) that way until their names would die and solidify into a shape and then fade away, I would say, All right.  It doesn't matter what they call them.  "And so when Cora Tull would tell me I waas not a true mother, I would thinnk how words go straight up in a thin line, quick and harmless, and how terribly doing goes along the earth, clinging to it, so that after a while the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other; and that sin and love and fear are just sound that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words.  Like Cora who could never even cook."  Sorry for the long intro- but keeping that attitude towards words in mind, comprehend the significance of the quote I really wanted to address.  "One day I was talking to Cora.  She prayed for me because she believed I was blind to sin, wanting me to kneel and pray too, (this is the big part) because people to whom sin is just a matter of words, salvation is just a matter of words too."  I read it as questioning a lot of peoples' grasp on religion.  Sinners who believe that sin is just in words miss the meaning of words, miss the meaning of sin.  Addie really does know sin, she has a child from a man outside her marriage and holds resentment towards her whole family as well as God.  I think this is a quote that can have a lot of interpretation, so think about it and post your thoughts.  Love Rob
