Paul we're both too worried about our images.  Maybe we didn't need to apologize, but we'll just chalk it up to dignity and chivalry.  Even if our politics don't see eye to eye, we agree on the worth of the New York Times.  The NYT (as it is known by those IN the know) posts its articles online without a monetary fee of any kind, all they ask for is your e-mail.  If you want, The NYT will send you the morning headlines on the subjects that interest you (business, politics, international, sports, etc.) with links to their articles, but more on that later.    I haven't read DaVinci code, but I'm damn interested.  Copies are flying off the shelves, and I'm all for a nonstop read (I've read every Harry Potter book but the last one atleast 3 times, and I'm not ashamed to admit it).  For something shorter and tied to "Night," a town in Italy is attempting to convict several former Nazi SS members (a story I got through the free NYT e-mail headline service).  You can read about it here; http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/international/europe/18TUSC.html?th .  I have my opinions, but didn't read "Night," so I'd like it if someone else gave theirs.  I'm posting this on Miss Clark's blog as well, so if you have her for a teacher she feels neglected because her blog doesn't get this kind of action.  I'd also like other viewpoints on the issues and differences in opinions Paul and I worked ourselves through.  I'd enjoy this to be a political forum, and I know you all have something to say on the world as is today.  Love, Rob
