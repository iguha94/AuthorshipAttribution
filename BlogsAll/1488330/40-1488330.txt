I know how so many of you have complained about bringing up things that have already been brought up, but I really wanted to tell you all about something I learned this morning during my first period class.  I was talking to one of my friends, and she told me that her sister (who is 19 years old) got pregnant about a month ago.  The baby's wonderful and everything's fine, but I then my friend told me that her sister is considering getting an abortion instead of having the baby.  Before hearing that, I had been fine with abortion.  I don't consider it to be killing a life because it doesn't really have life yet, and I was totally pro-choice and all that.  But after hearing that one of my friend's sisters is considering getting an abortion...it just made me so sad that she would do that.  Maybe it's just because of the personal connection, but I just don't view abortion the same today as I did yesterday.  My friend is so excited to be an aunt! And just to take that away from her and everything, just because it would be the easy way out just doesn't seem right to me anymore.  I may be over emotional or something like that, but hey.  It's all good to me!  I know that this is an old topic, so you all don't really have to respond to it or anything, I just view abortion completely differently now that I have a more personal connection with it.
