Knowing what Jim had to go through and then at the end for him to just give it all up for the sake of Tom, proves Jim to be the more significant hero.  Throughout their whole journey Jim was always worried about Huck and concentrated on his friendship with Huck.  Whenever they were separted Jim would search forever for Huck until he found where he was.  They always ended up reuniting due mostly to Jim's love for Huck.  Not until the end of the book did Huck ever truly try to find Jim.  However at the end of the book Huck's love for Jim became more prevelant. Although Huck knew better than to do all the crazy things that Tom insisted they do in order to free Jim, somehow Huck's love for Jim was submissive to Tom's influence over Huck.  After trying so hard to escape to freedom then putting up with Tom's ideas of freeing a slave, Jim was still willing to risk it all for the sake of saving Tom.  This is what a true hero is.  Huck didn't have anything to lose, if people found out he had been trying to free a slave they would send him back to the widow's house and people would just think "that poor boy needs to be civilized." However for Jim, he had everything to lose, and he was willing to lose everything for Tom, who wasn't even a true friend to Jim.
