I think it's important to be realistic in this debate, if not simply because idealism will fail to present any real answers.  Pragmatism is key, and I think everyone needs to keep in mind that while America is a land which prides on being the land of opportunity for millions it is not.  America's middle class has been shrinking, and will continue to shrink while the lower class grows and upward mobility stalls.  With the education system in general disarray especially in impoverished areas, I think it's rather unrealistic to expect a majority of foster children or impoverished children to grow up to cure cancer or become doctors lawyers and indian chiefs(due note the culture reference there).  Not that I approve of abortion but we have failed to help the lower classes in the country, the reasons we have are up for debate(and would make for a good one), but I think not exasperating the problem is good policy.  Gay's should marry, marriage is secular in that it's awarded by counties irregardless of religion and brings with it financial benefits tax-wise.  Since these are both government imposed and our government is secular and thus should take no cues from religious authorities, I think gays should be allowed to marry.  If the word marry bothers people too much, I wouldn't be too opposed to changing the official term to civil unions for everyone and making marriage a religious only institution.  Maybe we could get 'civil unionized' at the justice of the peace, but married at a church, and the churches could decide to not let gays 'marry' perse but they could still reap the financial benefits and official representation from a 'civil unionization'.  Or we could just get it overwith and let the gay people marry.  It's going to happen eventually, why put up such a fight?
