I licked a dog biscuit once. I was too chicken to actually take a bite.  Cara- thanks for the advice. And you are right - everything doesn't have to be planned this minute. But I've made the mistake of choosing a wedding date that falls the same weekend as the Circle City Classic- so I do have to get the venues booked. Other than that, we already have the photographer and cake taken care of. His former co-worker now does wedding photography (after she retired)- I work with someone who used her- and they LOVED her pictures. She takes like 400 shots starting from when the bride gets ready- through the reception. She gets a set of the prints developed and put in an album- and then gives you all the negatives to make prints. All for $500. And his aunt Lisa is a professional cake decorator- so we lucked out there too- she'll just charge us for ingredients. Cara, I'll call you tonight (Thursday)  On another note- we're changing the wedding colors...i think we are going with mocha and cream (or champagne) now....sounds kind of dark- but it's really pretty, especially for a fall wedding.  Steph- so....um.....did anybody pee on you? ;)   Question: In the Friends episode where Rachel and Ross have a celebrity "list" of people that are "ok" for them to "cheat" with- how many were allowed on the list? 3 or 5? Marsh and I are being smart about our celebrity list. I chose Dave Navarro, so he chose Carmen Electra- because at least chances are decent that if we see one, we'll see the other and then we're both "occupied" ;)
