Oh Lordy... Somehow the ghetto mama creeped right out my ass tonight at the laundry mat.  All people (women especially) should know that in the laundrymat world a basket on a table CLAIMS that table for the folding of one's clothes- as long as that person remains on the premises.  This girl and her guy had to go and put their stuff on the table- right along side mine- and they pulled their clothes out of the dryer 5 minutes early *their stuff was 2 minutes behind mine by the timer* to fold it on my table. They didn't bother to move my basket or anything...yeah...the old Mersich temper got the best of me... I had to go snatch my basket and say "Yeah, like there wasn't 8 other empty tables you could have folded at right?". So she was like "Oh, your basket on the table means it's yours?". So I was like "Look- I'm just saying with 4 other tables that are empty and DIRECTLY next to this one- I don't understand why you had to take the ONE table that had stuff on it".   I think I coulda took her ;)  Now I just feel dumb...   Hey Cara- I agree with you about the Catholic Church- but just want to clarify (if indeed this is what you are referring too- if not, forgive me)- the pastor who is waiting for the final vote and it's being delayed by allegations- that's an Episcopal church- not the Catholics for once.  I am also thankful I DID NOT vote for Bush. If we have to live through term 2- I might just choose to sing "O Canada" for 4 years...
