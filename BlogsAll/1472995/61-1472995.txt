She moved in '00, but it was a couple of months before she actually hooked up with Adam.  I'd have to guess about 2 and a half years.  That's a good long time, though. :)  Somehow the thought of anything eating litter is just a bad thing.  I agree with Em that it could be dangerous, especially if you have the clumping kind.  Then again, cats do weird things, so who knows?  My new neighbor's brother asked me out this morning.  I was getting stuff in the car to come to work and he told me about Lotus Fest and kind of suggested that if I was interested maybe we could go.  So, I told him that I'm going to my parent's house tonight and then Brian is coming down with me tomorrow to stay the weekend.  I think he blushed a little bit, but it's really hard to tell with black people.  But I told him that I'd still like to hang out sometime, so I'm hoping I didn't hurt his feelings.  Still, it kind of made my morning.  Too bad I'm not into that poly lifestyle, huh? ;)  Tomorrow I'm going to get my birthday hair cut.  I'm really looking forward to it.  And I'm going to go to the store tonight, I think, so we don't have to go when there are people there tomorrow.  I hate Wal-Mart, but they have the best cereal prices around so I have to go there and stock up.  I'm totally out.  I hate it when that happens.  Everybody have a great day!  Love you and more later!  KJT:)
