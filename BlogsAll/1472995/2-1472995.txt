Emily--Did you just say you were talking to Jim? Please explain.   Nothing really new here. Bob came home from work on Thursday and says "I bought you a present!" So I get all excited because he never buys me things and ask what. He says "I bought you a swiffer and I got the new Matrix game!" I was so pissed. I told him that was no present and he sucks for presenting it that way. He then says, "woman, go fix me a glass of milk." I told him that he could get his own damn glass of milk. Buy me a fucking swiffer and expect me to be your fucking maid. He then tells me again to go in the kitchen and then I knew something was up because he never does that. So I went into the kitchen and he bought me the new Sims game, Superstar. I was very excited. He had me completely fooled. I thought I was going to have to get mean.  Bet you thought it would be a cat.   What else? Found out that one of our sales reps gives head to my general manager (the one that makes me turn red). That's the rumor anyway. It sort of makes sense since she's horrible and no one will (or can) fire her. He's disgusting though. I thought she would have better taste.   The season finale sucked on Friends. I have only seen two episodes this season but was totally able to predict what would happen at the end of this one. Remember when they were good? Ugh.
