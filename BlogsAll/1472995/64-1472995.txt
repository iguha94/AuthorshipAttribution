Em...They know that you, Marshall, Jen and John are coming. It's not a problem.  Jen...I think I told my mom to hold a room for you. Let me know ASAP if you don't want it.  Karissa...Sure, be lesbians for the evening! I don't mind.   I finally got a garbage disposal!! Of course we had to take Bob to the emergency room but it's there, damnit! I told him to have someone install it but he thought it would be cheaper this way. With hospital bill and tools he bought, it would have definitely been cheaper to hire someone to do it. He's fine, by the way. He hurt his middle finger and they had to burn a hold in the fingernail to get all the blood out. He was in a lot of pain because he didn't even fight me on going to the doctor.  His middle finger is now all bandaged and he gets to flip people off.  Poor Oscar is getting his balls cut off today.  I am STILL recovering from last weekend. I can't wait for this shit to be over. You know that bitch didn't even have a hangover when she woke up?! How is THAT possible? Even I would have been fucked up but she was damn chipper the next morning. She also claims to remember everything. Can't wait to get the pictures developed. BLACKMAIL.  Chris...what floppy hat? They are coming out with a rarieties cd AND another live DVD around my birthday. I told BOb that PJ knew when my birthday was and they always plan around it. I'm excited because it's stuff that I actually do NOT have.   Lunch is over. Gotta go back to work. See you guys this weekend.
