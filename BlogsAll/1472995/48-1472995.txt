sorry that i have been mia. our computer got attacked by the msn worm so i am now having to go to the library to get on the internet. things have been good in the beresford house. i was supposed to go to my first appointment yesterday with the dr. (actually it is only supposed to be an interview. which i think is wierd that they have to interview me to become a patient it's not like that i can become unpregnant.) but i had to reschedule for next week b/c they were having trouble verifying my cobra insurance. John and I registered this weekend and Pier One and Linen's N Things. Pier One has mostly furniture on it so don't be shocked when you pull that up to look at it but when they close the registry than we get a 10% discount on the stuff for a couple of months but we put a lot of really cool pictures frames and candle stuff on there. LNT does the same thing they give you a 10% discount for 18 months after your registry closes. John was cracking himslef up when we were registering at LNT b/c he would ask me how much a certain item was that I picked was and he figured out that the current theme was $20. He said that everyone was going to love us b/c we were the Kings of the $20 gift. So one word of advice Em when you register don't take Marshall. Boys get bored real quick and began to give the stellar advice of "I don't care" on what they want. Although John was pretty insistent that he wanted to Emeril pots and pans. Why he loves Emeril so much I don't know but he used to watch his show on the Food Network every night.  Cara I will be at Lisa's shower. It stinks that all you here is baby talk. And don't feel bad if you don't think that you are ready. Really no matter how ready you think you are when you see the 2 pink lines instead of one, your first response is holy shit. Hope everyone is well. Talk to everyone soon!
