Cara- sorry to hear about Ellen's dad- I will try REALLY hard to remember to send her a card (Karissa, I have her address too).  Just to make sure- it's just you coming to the engagement party right (boob can't make it, right?)- what about your mom or Lisa? I haven't heard from them, which is fine- I'm just curious.  Sorry that I've been sort of MIA for the last week or so- this work trip and now catching up is knocking me out.  Chris- didn't go to NYC yet- that's next week. Vegas then NYC...gotta love that.  Ok, I interviewed students at IU Bloomington yesterday for an intership program that I'm starting. This is a great resume builder for me- but I really had a good time doing it (barring the fact that most of them were so smart that I felt dumb). One also made me feel old. She lives at Teter and goes to Wright to eat (which is a 180 from what we did, remember Cara?) Which I relayed to her- and she said- "They probably didn't even have the food court in Wright back when you were here"...  Um...yeah..ok- so they didn't....but "back when I was there"??? Yeah- it was 8 years ago- not 80.  Marshall was so good to me when I came back from my trip- I missed him so much- and had been kind of crabby right before my departure (separation anxiety I'm sure)- he's been so sweet all week...I'm actually looking forward to going away again, because of the treatment I get upon my return.  Ok- engagement party list wrap up: Karissa, attending with Sarah Steph/Adam- not able to make it Cara- w/o Boob Chris & Liz Jen & John  right?
