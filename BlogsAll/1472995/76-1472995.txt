HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!!!!  JOYFUL SAMHAIN!!!!!!  HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!  Trick or treat: this morning as I was getting ready for work,I found my tweezers.  The ones that I thought fell down the drain, that preempted the leaky pipe in my bathroom?  Remember those?  Well, I was getting dressed and decided that I was going to put barettes in my hair instead of rubber bands so I got into the linen closet, pulled out the Pizza Express cup full of hair ties and what not, and there they were.  They have been under my lotion samples, deodorant crystal, fluoride toothpaste, and big rubber bands for nearly a month.  I have gotten into that cup a dozen times and never saw them there.  Today, the gleam of silver plating glowed brilliantly in the soft glow af 2 60-watt bulbs and I literally had to go call Sarah and tell her because I was so excited about finding them that I thought I was going to explode.  I swear the faeries had them hidden and just brought them out today.  I know I'm not the most observant person in the world, but I swear I looked there before giving up and buy a new pair of tweezers.  My heart is full, my spirit complete.  All hail the blessed miracle of the return of the hair-pullers!  woo-hoo!  It's the best Halloween  ever !  Ok, so I'm exaggerating just a little bit, but I swear I really am that excited about it.
