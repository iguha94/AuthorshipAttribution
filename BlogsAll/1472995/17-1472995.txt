Chris, I'm glad she's getting things worked out like that.  I'm sorry if I said anything about her that upset you but I'm still angry with her.  I'm wishing her well and hoping she'll be happy and successful and that's the best I can do.  I hope she continues to work things out in her head and gets her life permanently on track and that she and Patrick are happy together.  He can definitely be a good influence on her and that's what she needs.  My problem is that I'm holding a grudge and am having trouble letting it go, but I am trying to send her happy thoughts all the same.  Anyway, that's all I really had to say today.  It's Friday and I'm going to my mom's house to see my niece and nephew this weekend and other than that things are just the same.  As always.  Oh, but if any of you were ever Blue's Clues fans, I have a website for you.  Steve Burns used to be the host of the show but a year or so ago he left.  Now he's making a music CD that's pretty good.  His site is a lot of fun so even if you don't know who he is you should go check him out.  If you have trouble getting the affirmation page to work, email me and I'll tell you how it's done. :)  Enjoy!  And have a great day!  KJT:)  www.steveswebpage.com
