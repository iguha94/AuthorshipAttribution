So I was sitting in my house last night, watching Friends and waiting for my pizza to get there when I saw the weirdest thing out my window.  Gus and Katy were sitting in the windowsill, looking at something and hissing like there was no tomorrow.  Then I heard the first *thunk*.  My neighbor's dog was jumping at the window trying to get to the cats.  Hazel wanted to eat them for dinner and she was going crazy!  She's an average sized dog, a little on the short and round side, but she can jump!  I went out to talk to Katheryn and we stood there laughing at Hazel and petting both dogs.  Hazel ran around the side of the house and we heard a big crash, but didn't think anything about it because she has charged the window at every opportunity and keeps hitting her nose on it.  It's really kind of funny.  You'd think her nose would hurt.  My pizza got there and I went in to eat it, but when I set it on the table, I glanced up to see if Katheryn was walking passed and I noticed that the window was broken.  A huge chunk had fallen out and there was a big spike sticking into the room.  Apparently that big bump had been the last straw for the old glass.  I pulled the spikey piece out and put it between the screen and then window with the big chunk that had fallen out.  Luckily I had a flat box from the last time I went to Aldis, so I was able to block the window to keep the cats from pushing through the screen or possibly cutting themselves on the glass.  It's not really secure, but I'm hoping it'll at least hold until the people get there to fix the window today.  Oddly, the cats didn't bother the cardboard in the window, so I didn't worry about leaving them there and coming to work before the repair people could get there.  It'll be interesting to see how the people fix the window.  They tend to go for the quick cheap fix and do a shoddy job at it, so we'll see what the next fiasco is. :)
