Do you ever get that feeling in the back of your throat that there's something hanging down?  Not your uvula; that's always there.  No, it's kind of like something right above your gag reflex.  Or maybe it is the sudden awareness of your uvula.  I don't know.  All I know is that it's driving me nuts.  I keep wanting to snort and snuff to see if I can get it to go away, but that's not really the kind of delicate feminine behavior the people around here are used to seeing me exhibit.  The cursing and swearing are pretty typical, but I try to keep bodily functions to a minimum.  At least loud ones.  Because let's face it, when you have to fart, you have to fart, and it's always the time right after I've done that quite sneakily at my bench that someone comes up to ask a question.  Or, if I'm working over by the book shelves, that's the time they walk by to get to the copier.  It's so embarrassing, but it's also better than being in pain, so we just all pretend it didn't happen and get on with our lives.  At least, they don't say anything.  Maybe they are just afraid I'll do it again out of spite.  Hm....  Weird day.  Tuesday.  I have a doctor's appointment I forgot about.  Well, I didn't really forget.  I just wrote it on my calendar wrong so I thought it was on the 11th at 11.  Gee.  Wonder how I could have made THAT mistake.  Irony in the real world.  You know how Jake (boss not nephew) fought really hard to get us clear glass for the windows?  How he struggled to make the architects understand that we're not just being picky, that we have a reason for wanting things the way we want them?  And he won, right?  He finally got them to understand that slightly tinted grey glass would work just as well as the green they wanted to give us and wouldn't make us feel like we were working inside of a Coke bottle.  Guess who now has a large shrubbery outside his window obscuring his view.  It's very sad, really... :D
