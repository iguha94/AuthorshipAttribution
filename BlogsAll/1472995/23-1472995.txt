hey! i wasn't going to let anyone take the sale, so i got it and ended up doing over $1200 yesterday. :)  i will be soooo happy when i finally start getting commission this month.    sammy sosa has forever tarnished his career now.  just like pete rose did.  even though they are/were both excellent players, they made one big mistake and that's all people will talk about now.  oh well, hope it was worth it for him.  luckily pets grow pretty fast so your kitty bathroom woes should go away soon!  hopefully.  when we first got pandora my mom was on the verge of tears because she would always get into the plants and the soil stained the carpet.  but she eventually grew out of it.    jen, you should just tell liza not to even bother pretending to help with this wedding stuff.  obviously she doesn't want to help or she is too important to help so she can just go be in her perfect little world where material possessions are the most important thing.  if i had a bunch of money and my soon to be sister-in-law needed help, that would be the first place to use a little of what i'd have.  she's not in the wedding is she?  i'm glad john likes his job.  hopefully he's not getting overworked, but as long as he's getting paid well for it then it's a good way to pad your bank account. :)  i like busy times like that.  we just did inventory and that money plus overtime for my regular work put us up an extra $370 this pay period.  nice.  i'm just crossing my fingers that nothing unexpected comes up that we have to use that.  i better get back to work.  a bientot.
