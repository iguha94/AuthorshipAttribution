Hey Cara- I know about the holiday stress- it SUCKED not being at home at all for Thanksgiving- on the other hand- we had a GREAT time with his family- so it was sort of worth it. We are driving to PA on the night before Christmas eve and we have to drive home ON Christmas because Marshall has to work on Friday.  Then we are driving to Evansville on New Year's Eve and driving BACK on New Year's day (again, because he has to work that Friday).   My thoughts on Christmas: Though I totally wish I could buy for every single person (read: significant others)- I really can't. I was planning on being able to budget for the girls, and Chris. I suppose that some of the gifts could be dual-purpose (meaning his/her) gifts- but since my list of others to buy for this year grew so dramatically (all of Marshall's family too)- I wasn't really prepared. As far as amounts- I would say that $15-20 is appropriate if you (meaning, any of us) can afford that. However, good news- we decided to start a Christmas fund right after this year to take care of next year! ;) I stuffed myself at 2 houses too- first his grandma's and then his friend Matt's.   I don't know about date's for Christmas- maybe the weekend of Jan. 9th??? And I'm offering up my place because Marshall and I will be at the new apartment- but if you guys would like to have it elsewhere, I'm game.  That's my opinion....  Cara- I'm sure your hair looks great- can't wait to see it!
