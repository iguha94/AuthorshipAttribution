hey guys, what's jenny d's website?  i'd like to check it out.  the last time i talked to her was in vegas, and we got along just fine (even though she still has my shirt and maybe a couple of other things :)).  she did seem really happy and it made me think maybe she did get some stability in her routine.  i hope she likes working with kids, i guess you have to if you put that much effort into getting a daycare started! :)  it sounds like she is making bloomington her home for awhile.  i don't like gnomes either.  they are tacky and ugly.  they seem like they belong at a mini golf place or an amusement park for little kids.    cara- at least you'll know never to buy that color paint again! :)  you live and learn.  luckily it can be changed.  have you gotten everything unpacked yet?  i know it took me a couple of months, no actually there are still some things in boxes right now.  no use getting them out yet.  i have to help with inventory tomorrow.  yuk.  and tonight i am going to a friend's "lingerie" party (instead of bacholerette party-she didn't want strippers) and she is the only one i will know there.  i don't like those situations.  i probably won't say 2 words the entire time i'm there.  at least it's only for a couple of hours. :)  talk to ya later!
