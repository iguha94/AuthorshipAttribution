Karissa what beautiful imagery! That was a really great post.   Ok- Sappy alert: So I'm sleeping last night while Marshall was role-playing with Brian. . .Around 12:30 or so, I thought I heard him come in, but I was sleeping so I didn't really stir too much. I heard him get in the shower- and then I think I woke up a little as he got out of the shower. But when I thought I heard him talking, that's when I got up, because it startled me. Turns out he's had car trouble and had to call off work to deal with it today. But since I was up, I said hello and proceeded to go to the bathroom. As I'm going into the bathroom, Marshall says "Don't come out until I tell you, ok?". So I laughed and said "Fine"- wondering how long I'd be holed up in the tiny space that is my bathroom. After a minute or so, he said "Ok, you can come out.". There he was, on one knee, with my engagement ring- and he asked me to marry him all over again. How could I turn down the freshly showered, boxer-clad love of my life? I wouldn't even if I could.. . .I couldn't sleep all night. I was so happy, and so excited and just so thrilled with everything. I hate to be so sappy and so cutesy sometimes, but with him, I can't help it...."they" always say that there is love worth waiting for....I'm so glad it didn't pass me by- my big-hearted, romantic, LAN party attending, geek.
