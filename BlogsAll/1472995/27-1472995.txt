jen is still here. this past week has been nutso. glad that everyone is doing well. Cara I think that it is great that you got a new kitten. I wasn't a happy camper this weekend b/c on Friday night John and I went out to dinner and as we were leaving the parking lot this guy backed into my car. So now I have a dent on my nice 6 week old car. He didn't have his registration or insurance info with him so we had to call the police and than wait an hour for the cops to show up (must've had fresh donuts at Krispy Kreme)! The guy admitted to the cop that he had had a couple of glasses of wine in the resturant and that he was also heavily medicated (didn't get to hear what for since he turned towards the cop and wispered why). The cop didn't do anything about it and than lectured us on waiting for so long for an officer when we could have just exchanged info. I lost it on the cop. I told him that we tried but the dumbass (didn't use that word BUT man did I want to) didn't have any of his information which by the way didn't think was legal. So FYI in the state of Indiana you can have any car that you want no registration and no car insurance information and you won't get into trouble. Yeah and get this since we called the police (b/c we had no choice) if I don't send this piece of paper into the BMV in 10 days saying that I have insurance (which I do) my license will get suspended.  On a positive note I have lost like 10 pounds and can zip the top of my wedding dress up! The bottom always fit but when Aida bought it the top didn't zip (must have been the massive boobies ah not :)  )  But now it fits and I am so excited.  Gotta get back to work more later.
