Em, I just watched that episode of Friends a couple of weeks and it was 5.  I remember that Ross had Dorothy Hammill on his list, which just always struck me as weird.  Isabella Rosalini may be international, but she's way cooler than Dorothy.  I mean, if nothing else, the name thing would get in the way.  It's not Sheldon, but it might as well be.  Plus there are too many Wizard of Oz jokes to go along with that one.  Steph, I was totally going to ask if you got Adam to pe on your leg for you.  I mean, we finally have an opportunity to find out if that is just a Friends subplot or if it really works.  I'm sorry you got stung, though.  Yesterday I wore mis-matched shoes.  I was getting ready for work and decided to go get doughnuts so I was kind of in  a hurry and I was about half way to the doughnut shop when I realized that my right shoe felt really smooth.  So, I looked at my feet.  And I looked at them again.  And I looked at them again.  Then it struck me what was wrong.  I was wearing one old flip flop and one new one.  Not only did it feel weird, but the old ones don't make noise anymore because they have totally formed to my feet so when I walked it went flip *sh* flip *sh*.  I couldn't walk anywhere without giggling. :)  Needless to say, I was very careful to get both new shoes today.  I'd wear my tennis shoes but Ada scratched the hell out of my toe the other morning (gods forbid I move my foot under my blanket) and it kind of hurts to walk on it if it's all confined in my shoe.  OK, so it's probably fine now, but I just really like wearing flip flops...;)
