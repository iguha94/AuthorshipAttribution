Emily, you always have the best luck with those things!  I've never gotten the hang of it and I think if I ever managed to get something, it would end up costing me $12 in quarters, anyway.  I think I'll stick to getting toys the old fashioned way: stealing them from little kids. ;D  I'm so excited!  The kids are coming down this weekend!  I'm going to get to see my Jacob and my Magpye!  And we're going bowling!  And I'm doing laundry!  Could this weekend get any better?  Well, I can think of one thing that would make it perfect...  never mind!  It's going to be a great weekend!  And it's Jenny's birthday!  Yea!  Very exciting. :)  Yesterday my friend Tressa and I dug up this geode that I've been looking at since last winter.  It lived out behind the SRSC beside the sidewalk that goes from the parking lot up to the back of the building.  Tressa remembered a spoon so we were able to get it out.  It took like 15 minutes of digging and then some hard pushing and pulling, but it's here now, sitting on my desk.  I'm thinking about making it my pet rock.  Garry and Tressa both want to break it open but I won't let them.  I have a little geode out in the car I'm going to bring in and let the smash, but this one is going to have to stay as it is.  It looks like a mountian.  It's flat and wide at the bottom (which is part of the reason it was so hard to dig out) and rounded at the top.  So it's an old mountain; it's still the biggest geode in my collection.  I'm very excited about that, too. :)  I think it's all the sunshine; it makes me happy. :)
