I think it's cool that everyone wrote- I really like this thing- Thanks again Karissa.  Chris!!! Good to see you old buddy old pal. Can't wait to hear the homeless cyclist story- your stories rank among the best. I think it's the delivery.....  Cara- really- don't feel guilty about graduation for one more second. You would have been bored anyway. And definitely hungry, then you would have been grouchy. :) My brother is still in State College- PA at Penn State. He isn't moving after graduation- his lease is through August, but he doesn't know what he's doing either- he's in limbo right now. He doesn't know what he's going to do for money either.  Granted, he got the looks- but I got the planning skills (which I had to develop- so perhaps he'll come around). I'm still looking in the want ads- I'm not counting out anything- but it was nice to be noticed for my hard work. I probably have a bunch of books I could donate to the library too- I have books I couldn't sell back (novels) and I won't ever read again. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate good literature- but it took me everything I had to get through Grapes of Wrath.  My boss doesn't sneak around- he just yells through the wall at me- or sneaks up to my window (that doesn't look outside, just looks into the hall) and peaks through the blinds....he's a dork- but an ex-NARC so he's sneaky.
