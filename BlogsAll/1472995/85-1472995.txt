Steph....I like the Big Boi (I think he spells it that way) song too. We saw them on Saturday Night Live last week. I hear the Hey Y'all song on Q101!! Bob sings it all the time. "Shake it...shake it like a polaroid picture..." This guy at work has the cd and he says its really weird. The song after Hey Y'all is about how this girl's shit really does stink. He was going to let me borrow it but he never brought it in. :(  Karissa...I thought for sure your favorite song would be Baby Got Back! Sick of it already? Congrats on the weight loss.  I've got some bad news. Aunt Ellen's dad died yesterday. I don't know if you guys remember him from the Engagement Party. The funeral is going to be on Friday. Bob and I are taking off work. It only feels right since they've done so much for us. Even my parents are thinking about making the trip up. Plus Bob's other great aunt is dying of cancer. She lives in Tennessee and I've met her a couple of times. It was not a good day in the Cunningham/Rose family yesterday. When I told Bob that I had bad news, he asked "aren't you going to give me the choice of good or bad news first?" I felt horrible because I had no good news to tell him.   By the way, I also have an ulcer in my eye for sure. Never sleep in your contacts, folks!
