The saga of the broken window continues.  Not only has it not been replaced, it's been taken away.  I didn't mention it yesterday because I was hoping, like an idiot, that its absence meant that it would be back and fixed by the time I got home.  No such luck!  So I had to find a bigger piece of cardboard to wedge in the window to keep the cats out and away from the pieces of broken glass they thoughfully left behind when they took the rest of the window, frame and all.  You know, it's a good thing I don't throw anything away or I wouldn't be able to let the kittens in the living room.  Bastards!  So I called them this morning and if it's not fixed when I get home tonight, I'm going to let Garry yell at them tomorrow.  He thinks better when he's riled than I do, and he has a much scarier voice, so they might take him more seriously.  As always, I had forgotten it was September 11.  Ditto what Em said to everybody and right back at you, babe.  Other than the window, no news down here.  It's amazingly quiet, but then, that's how it usually is.  Oh, well, I did fall off my ball last night, but I didn't get hurt.  This time I fell off head first...;)  No, really, I was in a plank position with my legs on the ball and they slipped off so I landed on my knees, but it was funnier the other way....
