hey! i didn't go to the bingo thing.  the person we were going to go with didn't go that week.  but i'll go soon and then i will give you all the details.  i've been pretty busy this week.  adam's brother, henry, had to be completely moved out of his old place by friday so i went along to help move, but he didn't have anything packed so i couldn't do much.  and then it literally took 3 days to move everything down the street to his estranged wife's house.  and then his new place in the french quarter still doesn't have electricity so he is staying with us until that happens.  so that has been my week from wednesday to today.    karissa, break that thing open witch! :)  i don't think i would be able to stand just staring at it knowing what was inside and that would be prettier to look at than the outside.    cara, good luck with the shower!  that's a lot of people to host.  maybe that speech at work was a good thing because now you'll be even more prepared for that many people.  that's good that your boss talks to you now.  hopefully he has a lot of respect for what you did.  maybe he sees it as the new girl taking charge!  i want to expatriate, but just to all over the world.  panama is looking nice right now.     i think we're getting ready to leave, i'll talk to you guys soon.
