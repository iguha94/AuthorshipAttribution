Hey, everybody!  I'm playing with the page setup.  If you don't like it, let me know and I'll change it back.  Hell, if I don't like it, I'm going to change it back. :)    Nothing exciting here at all.  It's a Wednesday and that's about it.  I've never played Sims.  Don't look so shocked; I'm sure I'd be addicted to it faster than snot in a sneeze, but it's not Mac compatible.  Nothing is these days.  But just wait until Steve Jobs takes over the world.  Not only will we all have to dress like him (black long-sleeved T-shirts and jeans) but we'll all have iBooks in our bathrooms, flatscreens in the office, and iPods implanted in our brains.  And he won't charge us a million dollars to do it, like Bill Gates would if he could.  Only half a mill...;)  I can't wait to see Matrix Reloaded.  I didn't want to go last weekend because I knew the theatre would be crazy wild.  Maybe I'll catch a matinee sometime this weekend.  No, I'm helping Sarah and Rob hang drywall.  Well, I'll get there sometime.  I want my first viewing to be on the big screen, not in my living room.  So, I'd better think about getting some work done.  The end is in sight for my least favorite task, so I'm going to push hard today to finish my boring job so I can do something more exciting.  You know, like sew pamphlets into binders.  :)  Anyway, have a good day and I'll talk to you all later!  KJT:)
