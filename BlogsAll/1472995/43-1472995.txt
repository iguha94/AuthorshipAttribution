This just in..... I can now get on the internet. Yeah me! All things good in the Beresford Bungalow. John and I have offically set the date as Nov. 27. We are still planning for Vegas but I have to now search for were in Vegas I want to have it. I know that this is short notice and you guys may not have the money to go and or want to spend the holiday with your families so please do not feel bad if you can not make it. I would of course love each and everyone of you there but I understand how life works and it may not be easy for you guys to get there.  We broke the baby news to John's family this week and everyone took it well. So that is a big relief. I am 8 weeks now, so only one more month of hell and than apparently I am supposed to magically stop puking my guts out as soon as I hit 12-13 weeks. We will see. I am carrying a Beresford baby so it is bound to be difficult, more than likely late (b/c when is a Beresford ever on time) or both.   The alteration business is going well. Kerri has come to work for Aida and she is catching on to everthing quickly. It's pretty neat which ever area that one of us is struggling to learn the other one knows how to do it. So even though we are both learning how to do everything right now eventually she and I can specialize in certain areas.  Aida is being really supportive of everything. She has really chilled out with age. I think that we are going to try and get the basement fixed up at the shop so that for now at least me but also when Kerri has children that we can bring them to work and not have to pay for daycare. If it's not ready by the time I get back from maternity leave than I think that she is still going to let me bring the baby but I will keep it in a pack and play.  More later it is way past my bedtime. It's nice tonight John is even Evansville so I get the whole bed to myself. Yippy!!  Jen  P.S. If it's a boy-Samuel Kenneth        If it's a girl-Emily Grace Oh and if now one told you guys Liza is also pregnant. She is exactly one month ahead of me.
