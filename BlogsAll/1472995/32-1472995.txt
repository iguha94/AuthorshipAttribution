I'm here. I have been quite the busy woman, working overtime and throwing a birthday party for the husband. Had about 20 people over on Saturday night and I think it went rather well. It's amazing how just his close friends and family turn out to be so many people. I made him a cake (FROM SCRATCH) and cookies. Ordered pizza and stuff. Poor guy had to work all day today.   Emily, I freaked when you were describing Marshall because I knew a Marshall a long time ago who would be that age, over six feet and red hair. But I remembered he went to IU and not Ball State. If his last name is McNeely, I think I'll have a heart attack. Let me know what weekend you wanna come up. To be honest, my weekends are becoming quite full for some reason. I think I'm coming home on June 28-29. I haven't been home in so long, it's terrible.   Chris, I wish you luck on Tuesday. Kristy says Mike is her "sort of boyfriend." He met the parents and they approve. They were amazed how "comfortable" they were with each other and actually held hands. We're trying to convince her to take him to Megan's open house but I don't think she's ready for that.   Steph, worm's way is a hydroponic shop that was off of Hwy 37, if i remember correctly. Jenny's Patrick works there. How are things with your brother and his wife? I never hear anything from them anymore. I hope they are doing well. What does he do for a living?
