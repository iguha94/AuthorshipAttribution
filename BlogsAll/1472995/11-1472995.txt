Man- what a week! I'm so glad it's almost over! I've worked so many hours this week, I stopped counting a long time ago. I was in bed by 9:30 last night- and I SWEAR I was asleep by 9:32. Things are good here- though busy. I got prime tickets to the Indy 500- wish me luck, I'm going with Tim. Other than that- I've made some new friends. These people are the equivalent to friends we would make if two short busses collided. They are our friendship equals- it's really odd. Anyway...it doesn't hurt that I'm very attracted to one of them...but that's a whole other story. But his name is Brian- and I think you'll all be hearing more about him in the future. As for Rene and/or Jim- both are still lingering in my world. Rene just calls once every couple of weeks and wants to get together- which never works out because he always chooses a day when I'm busy.  And Jim is "anti-female" right now (but he's quick to say that it has nothing to do with me)- he drives me freaking crazy which is why I can't date him anymore- but I'm trying the slow letdown method. I probably should go the bandaid route- but I can't do that. I actually picked up my diploma this week- it's pretty cool. I had to make copies for HR and my boss for my personnel file. Neato.  What else, what else???  My apartment is a freaking mess- I haven't had time to clean this week and it just keeps getting worse. You watch- this will be the weekend someone does a "drop in". Well anyway- short but sweet- I have to finish up work so I can get the hell out of here today. Have to work tomorrow morning too. Talk to you guys soon!!
