Mrs. C- that's fine- seems that might be the case for quite a few- but we totally understand- it is a week before a major holiday. Glad you'll be able to make it.  Steph- sorry you can't make it too- but I totally understand. Best of luck with the mortgage stuff, I know what all goes into it- when Marshall and I first attempted that whole thing- it was just so much to deal with, I couldn't do that AND a wedding at the same time. Good Luck!  As for your question- no, no luck on the job front just yet.  We saw Scary Movie 3 and Radio this weekend- both were good- but I REALLY loved Radio (with the exception of the fucker who ANSWERED his cell phone and proceeded to have a 10 minute conversation on it.  On another note- Jen went with me on Sunday just to go dress browsing up at the Bridal Outlet in Castleton. I was looking for a specific gown I had seen online that they carried that designer. Well- they didn't have that dress in sample at the store- so I started to look around- and picked out 2 dresses to try on. The sales lady said that she thought I would really love the one particular dress because it flatters people who are short like me and built like me- she said it really accents the curves and accentuates the positive...well, I put it on and fell in love with it. I mean- I felt like my waist was just so tiny in this thing (which is all an allusion, but hey). Jen took a pic on her phone, which I will share- but she's having trouble getting it to send, so there is a little delay. But just to give you the details- it's white, halter top style. The front is a sort of a teardrop waste- and the front pleat splits into a V. The designer doesn't have a website for me to pull the dress off of, but I'll try to find something similar to post. It is NOTHING like what I would have ever thought I'd like, but I'm SO glad I tried it on....I think it's the ONE.   Talk to you later..
