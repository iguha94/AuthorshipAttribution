all of you crack me up!  i used to mix match socks too, but never shoes!  :)  i never had 2 pair that were so similar.    no one peed on me.  it does work though, like jen said.  it wasn't that bad of a sting really.  it itched immediately after it started to burn, but i was still able to walk and everything.  at first no one even thought it was a jellyfish, but after the mark was still there hours (and eventually a few days) later adam said, "huh, maybe it WAS a jellyfish!".  after it happened i did see one which was weird.  that was the first time i had seen a jellyfish not in a tank.  it was small, but i was in chest deep water and thought, "shit, i better back away from this thing".    jen, that sucks about not getting much monetary help for your wedding.  i know what it's like to have to save a lot of money all yourself.  adam and i have been saving like crazy for a house.  i can't stand metairie!!!  i'm ready to move out of apartment living and we are definitely going to call movers.  i am DONE moving loads of furniture and boxes.  forever.  :) i wish i could be at your engagement party!  here's my address anyway, if you can send me an invitation i'll keep it with the wedding invite i still have of cara's.   1508 clearview pkwy, apt a metairie la 70001  i wanted to get one of those balance balls too but never did.  i just do the 8 minute abs thing and the elliptical trainer.  maybe soon i will get one though.  sounds like fun.  i only knew a few words to the iu song, but have forgotten most of them now.  cara, did you have to drive with your eyelid sticking like that?  i've waxed my eyebrows before but never had that pleasure.  never tried a dog biscuit.  yuk!  i also never ate paste or my own boogers.  talk to you girls latuh! ;)
