Em, you crack me up!  You and Rob are so funny about that stuff!  He won't admit to liking Disney movies even when he laughs his ass off when we finally manage to drag him kicking and screaming to the theater.  We're like, geez, it's only $2 and 2 hours of your life....  When you said you were doing internship interviews, I thought you meant that you were looking for an internship so you could leave your job.  Is it weird to anyone else that Em just did a really grown-up thing by running interviews?  That's something adults do.  No offense, I just never think of us as adults.  We're... I don't know... not grown-ups....?  And I think I would have had to beat that girl down on principle, if nothing else.  Waaaaaaaaaaay back when you were in school...  Yeah, I'll show her back in the day...;)  And just for the record, when I was there (the year after you two), there was a food court, just not a cafeteria, though Wright did have the largest cafeteria on campus before they ripped it out and put in the food court.  I don't know why I know that, but it seems like I read it somewhere, so it must be true...  Dude, Em, I forgot to ask Sarah so I don't know about her for sure.  I'll check with her and let you know.  Did I tell you guys about dreaming that I grew a beard?  Yeah, there's this guy who works here (that if he wasn't married, oh boy!) who grew a beard when it started to get cold.  Well, for some reason I dreamed that I grew a beard just like his over night and no one cared.  They were all like 'just shave it' and I was like 'no, it'll come back thicker.  I want to go to that Hair Today Gone Tomorrow place they talk about on the radio all the time.'  And I was just really distressed.  And I looked kind of like Kevin Smith, though shorter and with bigger breasts...  Just weird.  And that, my friends, is why I don't do drugs....
