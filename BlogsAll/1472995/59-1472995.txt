Hey, guys!  Guess who I saw last night?  George!  Remember my friend Chris who I call George?  He came over to the GS house once.  He was at the Irish Lion with his wife ans some other people I don't know.  He's playing organ at the Lutheran Church on 7th Street, he and his wife just bought a house on the west side of town and he's back here getting his masters in math.  Hey, if it hadn't been for him, I never would have passed calculus.  So I gave them my number and email address, but since I know he's a student, I can always look him up.  I wonder if his email is the same...:)  Other than that, Abby and I had a good dinner with my Dad.  Since Mom's in Chicago taking care of the kids, he's got the house to himself.  I don't think he wanted to eat alone, and since he had a golf tournament in Ellotsville yesterday it was really easy for him to come over and take us out.  I'm glad Abby got to go, too.  It was a nice dinner and a nice surprise to see Chris/George. :)  And, just so you know, I also managed to NOT fall off my balance ball last night.  I think it helps I was doing the upper body work out and didn't have to balance nearly as much, but still, no more floor burns on my elbows and that's a good thing.  Wednesday I'm going to try the ab workout so we'll see if I can keep that record going. :)  I may not be able to walk upright after it, but by gods, I'll look good...;)  Mom is going to get me a new balance ball for my birthday, one that's the right size, so then hopefully the injuries will subside.  In the mean time, well, at least it's something to laugh about. :)  I'll keep you posted on future injuries...;)
