What does one have to do to become a licensed childcare provider?  I'm going to assume there's no drug test involved.  As for Patrick being her fiance, I'm sure that's happened.  When she was in Vegas she kept talking about how her family expected her to come home married and all that crap.  Really, I kind of feel bad for him.  I mean, she's messed everything up with all of her friends in the past, so wouldn't logic say that it's only a matter of time before she gets tired of dealing with him and messes him up?  Sorry, Chris, but that's what I've seen of your cousin's life so far and while I hope she'll be able to change it, I wouldn't hold me breath.  She can't "play poor pathetic me" if no one is mistreating her or there's no one to complain to about imagined mistreatment.  I hope she's successful, but I'm also glad she's out of my life.  Jen, congrats on not hitting Jenny with a rock when you saw her.  I'm not sure I could have refrained.  Oscar sounds cute.  Is he a tortoise shell?  It kind of sounds like it.  You'll have to take some pictures and email them to us.  I can't wait to see him. :)  What color are his eyes?  Ada's started out blue and then shanged to gold, which was really wild because I didn't know cats' eyes changed like human babies' do.  I know, you've all hear that before, but I still think it's really cool. :)  Anyway, nothing really big is going on here.  Oh, wait, yes there is.  The Magpye is walking now.  My sister called last weekend to let me know that she is walking all by herself.  Not very far, but she's doing it.  That's my girl!  I'm going to see her a little bit this weekend and I'm wondering if she'll be running yet. ;)  I can't believe she's almost one year old.  Yey for her!  Ok, well, I just wanted to say hey and let you all know I'm alive and sending you happy thoughts.  Have  good afternoon and I'll talk to you later.  Love you!  KJT:)
