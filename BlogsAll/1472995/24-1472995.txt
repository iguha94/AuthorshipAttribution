I agree that I think that Sosa knew what he was doing to get out of his slump. I'm bet it happens more than we think. I would ask my Sosa but he is busy being a bully to Gus. As for the pug name we were lucky that whatever name we picked out fit our animals the only one we didn't do that to was Gus. We got to know the little chunk first and one day it came to us he was looking at us with his big brown eyes and we said Gus and he barked so we knew that is what he wanted to be called. Just between us I think he was tired of John calling him Fat Ass.  That's great that Kristy is dating someone. Just don't let Bob be too much of a big brother and scare the guy away. Steph-tell your boss to blow it out of his butt. If you did the sale than take it. Don't let him give it to a salesperson that probably got to be his favorite b/c they service him in the fitting rooms. Hey it happens! Chris-John and I would love to use the rooms but he has to work all weekend and I have to help his mom throw a shower for his brother and fiancee.  Funny how Liza is hosting the shower but Aida and I are doing all the work b/c Liza and Chris are redoing the front of the thier house so that they can do that parade of meridian and kessler homes. must be nice to have so much money that you don't know what to do with so you decide to make your house look different.  Em-good luck with your interview.  Cara-the poop drama will subside. give the little guy sometime. think about it it's a boy he's lucky he makes it in the box half the time. I mean what it with guys? Is it that hard to aim into a toliet? Do you intentionally miss just for kicks? Chris any insite into this.  John is doing great. They just fired the other 2 sales people at this store so he is working overtime and selling like a madman. He's busy and sometimes grouchy but he is really enjoying his job. Gotta get back to work.
