Woo-hoo!  Steph and I were right!  And boy howdy is that nasty!  Gross!  Wow, just... eeeeeeewwwwwww!  Geez, Chris, like your butt would ever look big!  I'm so sure...  I still need to see Kill Bill, but I have a feeling I'm going to like it.  It just looks like way too much fun.  We're going to see "The Rundown" tonight.  It's already at the $2 movies.  Sarah likes Christopher Walkin, I like the Rock, and Rob likes action movies (but really, who doesn't), so I'm pretty psyched.  And just so you know, you know the fires in California?  Well, they are literally on Sarah's street.  Her parents were evacuated and everyone is safe, but they are living in a hotel now until the fires get under control.  So far, we don't think their house has been hit.  The keep calling the answering machine and it keeps picking up, and that seems to be a good sign.  I'll keep you posted.  Just keep your fingers crossed for them.  She's just having one of those years.  Did I tell you that she and Rob are moving up their marriage plans?  He has really good insurance at his work and with all of their medical expenses of late, they need that.  So, for insurance purposes, they are going to be getting married soon.  They want and Elvis impersonator to marry them.  I keep forgetting to suggest a trip to Memphis.  I'd better email her with that while I'm thinking about it.  Anyway, that's it for the pre-lunch thinking.  Fooooooooood...:)
