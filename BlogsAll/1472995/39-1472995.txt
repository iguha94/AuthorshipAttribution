Congratulations on the offer, Emily. Sorry to hear it wasn't exactly what you expected. If you're not as stressed, it's got to be worth it. I'm disappointed that I won't get to meet the famous Marshall, but there will hopefully be other times. Rene is not invited. :) Let me know when you guys wanna come up. I think all you need to bring are pillows.  Lisa is driving me and my mother nuts, but for different reasons. I'm trying to plan her shower, which I don't think she gives a damn about. I ask her questions and all I get is "I don't care," "whatever" or "do what you want." So I have no idea what she really wants and getting her to do ANYTHING is a struggle. I couldn't come home this weekend and I wanted her to look at shower places. She looked at ONE (the one *I* didn't like) and decided on that one. It's a cheaper place but that just means more work for me and mom. I swear, Ladies, just tell your maid of honor what you want. You're not going to look bossy....you'll be helping them. Jesus Christ. I don't know how any one put up with me because I was just as indecisive.  Mom's problem is Lisa is charging EVERYTHING and she's afraid she's going to go over her specified limit. The girl had the nerve to ask her if they could charge a new engagement ring because she doesn't like the one she got!! She bought wedding invitations that she now doesn't like and put the wrong start time on them!   Chris...Hope you didn't get rained out at Costello. Happy Belated Birthday Monkey Man!  Steph, it POURED over here yesterday and today. The 4th of July was just hot as hell. Watching fireworks on tv is just no the same.
