Hello females.  Hope you all had a nice weekend....  Thanks for the advice re: bell for the boss.  Tic Tacs and bears.  Who knew?  Maybe I give my boss Tic Tacs and hope there's a bear out there in search of minty breath.  Two birds, one stone.    I'm realizing this site is the equivalent of a guy's locker room.  Interesting.  I am quite aware of the male to female ratio though.  So, just for the record, I  love  Friends, kittens, and weddings and am totally annoyed when my underwear rides up : )    Congrats to Emily Mersich!  Are you still interested in working in an ad agency or just seeing where the road takes you?  Philly would be nice, and close to Latrobe, no?  Chicago would be nice too.  Let me know if you're looking, I'll ask around.  Hey, who Jim is?  This isnt Jimmy the Cupper is it?  If it is, I'll kick your ass.  That man's hand had the curvature of a soup ladle.    Jen, where did you move to?  How's that Beresford?  What the hell's a swiffer?    Have you seen Identity?  That's a f'd up movie.  I think I liked it, but am not too sure.    Not a whole hell of a lot going on up here, just working and sleeping and occasionally looking at houses/condos with a realtor afflicted with ADD.  I swear to the lord above, while we were driving to look at a condo, the woman says, "Look, an elf!"  I said, "Wha..?" and she says "...not really!"  That was it.  I must say though, she has very good taste and owners/developers seem afraid of her.  Anyway, we've seen a couple of places that are ok, but nothing that knocks our socks off.  Can you post pictures on this thing?  The Taste of Chicago is featuring Elvis Friggin Costello.  On my birthday.  The gods are smiling on me...  Ok, time to go home for dinner....take care.
