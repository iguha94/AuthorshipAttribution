Hey!  I thought I posted here earlier today but apparently it didn't go through.  Weird.  It's not even in the post section.  That's crappy.  I must have just hit the wrong button.  Anyway, I have some interesting news.  My Grandma Betty, my mom's mom, got married on Wednesday of last week.  The only reason we knew is because Grandma Brown saw in the paper that she had bought a marriage licence.  How wild is that?  But the guy seems to be good for her.  He is a retired nurse who worked with patients who were both physically and mentally ill, so he knows how to handle her.  He cooks for her and cleans up after himself and has fixed her car so they can take it places.  He gets her out of her tiny apartment at least once a day.  Well, I guess it's really their tiny apartment.  He moved in with her.  She's put on some weight (finally) and looks happy.  It was nice to see her looking so good.  Grandpa Brown was in pretty good shape, too.  He's perking around pretty well since his stint in the hospital.  His color is better, anyway.  Other than that, I can't remember what all I said.  I know that I seem to be the only one who was squealing with joy at the "Friends" finale.  I've been waiting all season for it.  I stopped answering the phone when it was on.  It pissed my dad off one night.  He called about 5 minutes before it was going to start and I was cleaning out the litter box so I just told him I'd call him back after.  It ended up he called me back and was a little pissy about being put off for a TV show.  Mom had warned him about calling me then and he did it anyway, so I don't feel bad about it.  SO now I'm going to get some work done and see if I can remember anything else I wrote in my post this morning.  I really thought I hit the right button, you know?  I've got to get my fine motor skills working again. :)  Have a good one and more later!  KJT:)
