Good to hear that you guys are coming. I thought you were but I wanted to double check. I think after all the worrying about inviting 60 people, we're not going to have that many. Unless people forgot to RSVP and just show up.  My cousins didn't think they had to RSVP. I could understand if the shower was at someone's house but not when you have to have the damn thing catered!  A couple of years ago, my dad wanted a telescope sooo bad. That's all he wanted for Christmas was a telescope. He didn't want a cheap one...noooo...he wanted the BIG one. So we got him one and he was so excited. But all he could get into focus was the damn moon and now it's collecting dust somewhere. He would get it so the moon would take up the entire lens, so it looked like you were looking at just a white light.   Shaun Richter is getting married in Vegas this weekend. I heard he wanted Elvis to marry them.   Oscar got his rabies shot yesterday and now he's been lying around. I don't think he feels well.  Holly is pregnant, which is very exciting and all. I'm just so sick of talking about freakin' babies. It would be different if they talked about the cute things they do but it's all about how much they slept or ate or spit up. I am so bored with the conversations that I can't stand it. It's in such detail too. I wanna run out of the room screaming. I guess I shouldn't talk like this with Jen being pregnant and all but I know we'll have other things to talk about when she does have Sam or Emily. Plus she won't make me feel like an outsider because I don't have kids. I'm starting to wonder if I'll ever want to have them.
