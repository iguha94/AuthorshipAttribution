Cara- good to hear from you! Jen and I were just talking yesterday about how we really missed you and talking to you- everything's just been so busy. I'm impressed with the cake from scratch.   Marshall's last name is Myers. I call him slim shady- and he hates that. But with a name that rhymes so closely with Marshall Mathers (aka Eminem)- how could I resist? If he and I end up together for any length of time, it sounds like I'll be wisked off to Florida for about 2 years while he goes to film school in Orlando. I'm not particular to Florida but I guess I could be ok with it for awhile....Actually, he was telling me about a movie that he wants to do- he was just giving me the skeleton of the screenplay, but it's pretty cool. He has a way of talking like I do- with the brain working faster than the mouth- it usually makes for funny conversation.   June 27th I go out of town for a week- so Cara, if you come into town, unfortunately I won't be here!  What are you coming down for?? There is some convention going on up in Chicago that Marshall wants to go to (I believe it has something to do with the Transformers)- so I'm hoping maybe he can do that, and I can go shopping....I'll let you know when that is- hopefully we can hook up (Chris that means you too).  Suppose I should do some work....man...too little sleep last night...I need to start getting home before 1 am.
