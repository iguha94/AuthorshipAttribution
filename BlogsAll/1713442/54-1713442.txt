  						     Factors Affecting Student Adoption of Online Education  Many of us are working with faculty who are putting courses online.  Some of use have any done this ourelves.  Teaching and learning is different in an online environment.  Some students resist the online model are are just not ready for it.  This article from  Academic Exchange Quarterly  looks at this and other issues impacting online education.  From the article:  "Online education is creating excitement among educators in colleges and universities in the United States and further afield.  For some it offers a way to reach a wider audience, including those not targeted by traditional higher-education institutions.  For others, it offers a new pedagogical tool that has the potential to transform the learning process.  And for others, as exhibited through the University of Phoenix Online Education model, it is perceived as an inexpensive way to grow their student population and revenues (Economist, 2002; Olsen, 2002).  While the reasons for implementing online courses and programs vary, a few common themes emerge from an examination of the literature: expanding access to under-served populations; alleviating classroom capacity constraints; capitalizing on emerging market opportunities - such as working adults - and, serving as a catalyst for institutional transformation (Aron, 1999; Berger, 1999; Eastman & Swift, 2001; Fornaciari, Forte, & Matthews, 1999; Oliver, 1999; Volery & Lord, 2000; Webster & Hackley, 1997)."  "The use of online education has grown significantly as a result of its real and perceived benefits (McGinn, 2000).  Urdan and Weggen (2000) state that revenues from Web-based training for online education are forecasted to climb from $550 million in 1998 to $11.4 billion in 2003.  John Chambers, CEO of Cisco, states that â€œeducation over the Internet is so big, it is going to make e-mail look like a rounding errorâ€ (Chambers, 1999).  The number of colleges and universities offering online education has also increased dramatically â€“ from 93 in 1993 to 762 in 1997 (Hankin, 1999), including many established universities such as Duke, University of Baltimore, Colorado State University, University of Florida, New York University, University of Maryland, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ohio University, Pennsylvania State University, Stanford University, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Tennessee (Eastman and Swift, 2001).  In 2000, U.S. universities offered over 54,000 courses online with an enrollment of over 1.6 million students (Driver, 2002).  A more recent estimate suggests that 2.2 million students enrolled in online courses in 2002 (Sausner, 2003)."  Full article at   http://rapidintellect.com/AEQweb/cho25934w.htm .
