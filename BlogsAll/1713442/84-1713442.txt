  						     The Big Six Information Skills As a Metacognitive Scaffold: A Case Study  This is a nice article on the Big Six information skills from  School Library Media Research  at ALA.  I'll admit that any article discussing "Metacognitive Scaffold" is difficult but this article is worth perusing.  From the article:  Several information problem-solving models exist for teaching and reinforcing the research, problem-solving, and writing processes. The Big Six information skills model (Big6) is one that is primarily aimed at kindergarten through twelfth-grade students. This model is intended to foster the acquisition of research, problem-solving, and metacognitive skills through the cooperation of both school library media specialists and classroom teachers. While a strong anecdotal record exists supporting the use of Big6, empirical research support is less evident in library and education literature. This study examines the effect of Big6 on a class of eighth-grade students asked to research and write about events surrounding the African-American Civil Rights movement. This study describes the context of the task students were asked to complete, student's experiences and reactions, and some conclusions that might be drawn from their experiences. It is a study based on a very small and homogenous set of students, but it tends to show the value of concise models that illustrate the full problem-solving process in order for young "researchers" to perhaps more fully grasp the extent of the task facing them. Such models, maps, and organizers should continue to be tested among many groups of learners to determine the full range of their value for giving the student greater confidence and understanding of the complexities involved in information problem-solving.
