  						     Welcome to LibraryInstruction.Com! Resources for Library Instruction. : If you haven't seen my LI site yet, please check it out and consider contributing.  Here is the CFP for the site:  "I have created this site with the intent of providing useful resources to my colleagues engaged in library instruction around the world.  This site contains library instruction lesson plans, articles about library instruction, and links to library instruction resources.   This site will work best if others contribute.  Here is what I am asking:   1.  Please send me any articles you have written that deal with library instruction issues.  (Obviously, only do this if you still retain the copyright to them!)  I will create a page for them at this site and link to it from the article page.  You will retain the copyright to your work.  I will remove it any time you ask me to do so.   2.  Please send me any library instruction lesson plans you have written.  These can be for any level of student.  I will create a page for them at this site and link to it from the lesson plan page.  You will retain the copyright to your work.  I will remove it any time you ask me to do so.   3.  If you know of any web resources that should be included in the links page, please let me know.   Please e-mail me at support@libraryinstruction.com with any contributions."
