  						     LM_NET On The Web  This is a list for librarians in the K-12 setting.  I joined it so I could send out an announcement for LibraryInstruction.Com.  It looks like there is a spam filtering system that requires posts from new subscribers to be approved.  Fortunately, my message was considered OK and forwarded to the list.  This appears to be a good method for keeping out spam.  From the list page, "LM_NET is a discussion group open to school library media specialists worldwide, and to people involved with the school library media field. It is not for general librarians or educators. We want to keep the activity and discussion focused on school library media. But, LM_NET can be used by library media people for many different things- to ask for input, share ideas and information, link programs that are geographically remote, make contacts, etc.  We currently have over 14,400 subscribers from at least 64 countries. Conversation on LM_NET should focus on the topics of interest to the school library media community, including the latest on school library media services, operations, and activities. It is a group for practitioners helping practitioners, sharing ideas, solving problems, telling each other about new publications and up-coming conferences, asking for assistance or information, and linking schools through their library media centers."  This lists generate about 60 messages a day.  If you are into K-12 librarianship, this would be a good list for you to subscribe to get new ideas.
