  						     ERICDigests.org - Providing full-text access to ERIC Digests.  Here is a site trying to keep the public domain ERIC Digests available to the public.  As the ERIC Clearinghouses are going away, this is important.  There are several hundred digests up now with a promise that the remaining 2500+ will be added throughout 2004.  From the site:  "Why ERICDigests.org?'   "The ERIC Clearinghouse system was eliminated in 2003.  ERIC is being massively reorganized and most of the content at the former ERIC sites (including the ERIC Digests) is in the process of finding new homes.  This site is striving to make it easy to find ERIC Digests that have been produced prior to the end of the former ERIC system.  (For information on these changes, see http://www.lib.msu.edu/corby/education/doe.htm.)"   "Please note that this site is privately owned and is in no way related to any Federal agency or ERIC unit.
