  						     Google Introduces Book Searches  Following the footsteps of Amazon, Google is now blending results from the texts of books within its searches.  Just like Amazon, the amount of full-text is limited.  If you want to read the book, you will have to buy it.  This seems like another good opportunity to explain copyright and how publishers want to make money off of their products to students.  This stuff is not given away for free.  Despite this, the copyrighted stuff you have to pay for (or get free from a library) is often the best source of information.  Maybe seeing this in a Google search result will help bring this point home.  From the blogged article:  "Google has launched an experimental program that indexes excerpts of popular books, blending the content from these works into regular Google search results."   "Google Print differs from Amazon's recently introduced Search Inside the Book program, which makes the full text of books available online to readers. By contrast, Google is indexing only a small excerpt from each book, typically taken from the inside cover, jacket reviews, author biographies or the book's introduction."  "If you want to purchase the book, Google provides links to the book's description page at major online retailers including Amazon, Barnes and Noble and Books-A-Million. These book sellers pay nothing for the links, and Google says it is not benefiting if you make a purchase from one of these retailers."
