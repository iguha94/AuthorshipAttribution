  						     How Parents of Home Schooled Students Can Get Their Children To Use the Library  Are some home schooled students discriminated against by public library librarians?  This link leads to a reasonable article about how home schooling parents can help their children get involved in library research.  However, it ends with the following:  "Some home school parents have reported problems with librarians and library staff who give their children a hard time when they are in the library during school hours.  If this happens, immediately let the library staff  know that your child is home schooled and has the right to be there during the day."  "Some parents have reported librarians who are unhappy or resistant to home schooled children because the librarians don't believe in home schooling.  If this happens, report the incident to the library administration immediately.  If you don't get a satisfactory response, write a letter to the library board and to the local paper.  You pay taxes and the local public library is obligated to serve you and your home schooled child.  If the library forgets this, remind the library staff forcefully."  Is this really an issue?  Are there actually librarians out there who would impede the library access of children who are educated at home?  Hard to believe I think.  Perhaps the home schooling parents are making unreasonable demands on the  library and some (including the author) don't like the library response.  But then again, librarians are a liberal lot and some may take umberage at students whose parents have deliberately shunned the public schools.  I hope librarians will remember the  Library Bill of Rights  and will do their best to serve the home schooled patron.
