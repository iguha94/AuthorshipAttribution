  						     Helping Your Child Use the Library  Those of us involved in college level instruction often forget that library instruction is done by public librarians, K-12 teachers, and parents.  Indeed, parents may be among the best teachers and advocates of library use that a student will ever know.  That is what the article linked to today is about.  Sample paragraph, "Helping your children to enjoy reading is one of the most important things you can do as a parent and well worth the investment of your time and energy. Kids will learn reading skills in school, but often they come to associate reading with work, not pleasure. As a result, they lose their desire to read. And it is that desire--the curiosity and interest--that is the cornerstone to using reading and related skills successfully. By far the most effective way to encourage your children to love books and reading is to read aloud to them, and the earlier you start, the better. Even a baby of a few months can see pictures, listen to your voice, and turn cardboard pages. Make this time together a special time when you hold your kids and share the pleasure of a story without the distractions of TV or telephones. You may be surprised to find that a well-written children's book is often as big a delight to you as it is to the kids."

Los ninos a prenden a leer en la escuela; sin embargo, con frecuencia asocian la lectura con el trabajo más que con el placer. Como resultado, pierden el deseo de leer. Ese deseo--esa combinación de curiosidad y de interés--es precisamente la clave de saber utilizar la lectura y otros conocimientos relacionados con ella."    http://www.libraryinstruction.com/ninos.html
