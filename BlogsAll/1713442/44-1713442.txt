  						     Academics and Professional Military Education (PME)  Here is an interesting article from  Academic Exchange Quarterly  regarding professional military education (PME).  While not directly related to information literacy, I found it interesting.  The author is arguing for changes in the way the faculty in PME in the USA are recruited.  From the site:  "Academics think of teaching most often in terms of conventional colleges.  But teaching in a military institution is quite different and in some respects compares unfavorably with traditional colleges.  The fact that PME does vary from more traditional college teach serves as a barrier to recruitment, especially in those disciplines like anthropology that are not represented.  The greatest drawback to teaching in a PME setting is that it is more difficult to specialize in teaching.  While to some extent becoming a generalist can be a refreshing departure from what many see as the excessively narrow specialization in higher education, [6] PME institutions may err in the opposite direction.  For example, at the Command and Staff College of Marine Corps University both political scientists and historians teach a core course that includes case comparisons of four military campaigns, even though the subject lies more within the historianâ€™s expertise.  Teaching that blurs disciplinary boundaries can increase the difficulties of linking teaching with research interests because finding publication outlets for research that similarly blurs disciplinary boundaries can be problematic.  The tendency to make faculty too much the generalist that creates such research dilemmas is perhaps more acute at smaller educational institutions with smaller faculties.  In the world of PME, the Marine Corps War College and Command and Staff College suffers the most from excessive generalization because the programs are the smallest in military education."
