  						     Welcome to the 419 Eater  Hate those damn spam e-mail messages promising you money from a Nigerian estate if you send them your bank account number?  The blogged site of the day does something about it as it glorifies a sport known as scambaiting. (The Nigerian scam is know as a 419...)  From the site:  "I created this site to pay respects to all the good people out there who in their own small way are helping to fight the war against scammers, and also as a forum to publish some of my own productions of course!"  "It doesn't matter if you are new to this 'sport' or a hardened veteran; if you're wasting the time of a scammer, that's good enough for me! Even if you are a newbie much fun can be had! If you are new to this game and need to know who/what I'm talking about, please click on the What is 419? button' to the left of this screen. See also Baiting Tips."  "So what is scam baiting? Well, put simply, you enter into a dialogue with scammers, simply to waste their precious time and resources, and hopefully make them look like complete idiots in the process. We often use the term "scambaiting".  "Of course, I didn't create this site just to show off my own work. I would encourage anyone to contribute to this site and the good cause of Scam-baiting by joining in the fun on the FORUM."  Actually, I have a deal for someone.  The Dean of the library at the Michigan Academy of Sasquatch Studies died recently in a tragic accident.  He left his entire estate of 5 million dollars to me.  I am trying get the money without my wife finding out.  My lawyer assures me if I can get the money to Nigeria that I am home free and can keep it all.  Can you kind Nigerian soul help me do this?  If you give me your bank account number, I will transfer all 5 million to your acount and you can keep 20 percent (1 million)!  This is risk free and it will work to both of our mutual benefit. I will pray that you do the right thing.
