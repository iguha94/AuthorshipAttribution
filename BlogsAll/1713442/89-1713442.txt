  						     Enhancing Information Literacy: A Practical Exemplar  This article is from New Zealand authors.  It is by Jeanine Graham (MA, PhD Auckl) who is Acting Chairperson, Department of History at the University of Waikato and Kathryn Parsons (BA, DipLibr Well) who is New Zealand Collection Librarian at the University of Waikato Library.  From the Abstract:  This case-study outlines a teaching partnership between library and academic staff at the University of Waikato.  It describes the strategies adopted to develop greater student information literacy and knowledge of source materials; and demonstrates the inter-relationship between student assignments and library resourcing. Both achievements and areas of difficulty are discussed.  At the University of Waikato, with 14,000 students, academic and library staff have sought to foster information literacy in ways that are effective and cost-efficient. Two clear trends have emerged over a decade of practical experimentation: the increased involvement of librarians in the academic teaching programme; and the deliberate designing of assessment tasks to ensure that students become confident users of the Library's resources.  Developed initially in relation to a New Zealand history paper which attracts 80-100 students, the partnership involves strategies that are carefully inter-related and readily adaptable to a variety of disciplines and teaching situations, an information literacy outcome that has long been advocated in the literature. (1) Underpinning all of the assessment ideas, though, is the in-house bibliographical guide to the New Zealand Collection (NZC), Map Library and relevant electronic resources.
