  						      CFP - Information Literacy   Academic Exchane Quarterly   is seeking manuscripts relating to information literacy for the Winter 2004 issue.   Elizabeth Blakesley Lindsay, who is the instruction librarian at Washington State University, is the feature editor for the topic.  Here is the CFP:  Focus:  Information literacy has transformed many library instruction programs into broader based, more collaborative efforts that address not only use of information resources, but also identification of information needs, evaluation of information, ethical use of materials and promoting awareness of economic, legal, and social issues regarding the use of information. This issue will examine theoretical and practical approaches for transforming library/bibliographic instruction programs into information literacy programs, fostering collaboration between librarians and faculty, defining and implementing information literacy competencies and standards, examining models and methods of instruction. Other issues to be addressed include teaching information literacy via distance education, debates over integrating information literacy into the entire curriculum versus delivery of skills through a credit course, and addressing assessment of information literacy skills.  Who Should Submit:  Librarians and faculty who have designed, taught and/or assessed information literacy programs are invited to submit manuscripts.   Please identify your submission with keyword: INFOLIT    Submission deadline: Regular deadline: any time until the end of August 2004. All accepted submissions will be published in this Winter issue, December. Short deadline: September or October. All accepted submissions will be published in this Winter issue or in later issues.
