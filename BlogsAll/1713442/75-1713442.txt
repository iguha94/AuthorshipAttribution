  						     Quality Library Media Programs Affect Academic Achievement  Here is another write up of several studies that clearly indicate that school library media programs help make K-12 students more academically competent.    From the site:  The evidence is mounting! By early 2000, researchers affiliated with the Library Research Service of the Colorado State Library and the University of Denver—myself included—had completed four statewide studies on the impact of school library media programs on the academic achievement of U.S. public school students:   "Information Empowered: The School Librarian as an Agent of Academic Achievement in Alaska"   "Measuring Up to Standards: The Impact of School Library Programs and Information Literacy in Pennsylvania Schools"   "How School Librarians Help Kids Achieve Standards, The Second Colorado Study"   "Good Schools Have School Librarians: Oregon School Librarians Collaborate to Improve Academic Achievement"   Philosophically, these studies are rooted in the "Information Power"  model espoused by the American Association of School Librarians and the findings from 6 decades of research related to the impact of school library media programs on academic achievement.   The latest edition of Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (1998) identifies three roles for school library media specialists. In a learning and teaching role, library media specialists advance the instructional goals of the school.
