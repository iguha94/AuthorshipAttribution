  						     ALA | Building faculty-librarian partnerships to prepare students for information fluency  Hannelore B. Rader wrote this article and it appears in  C&RL News , February 2004, Vol. 65, No.2. Fortunately, ALA put it up full-text online.  The blurb for the article reads, "Building faculty-librarian partnerships to prepare students for information fluency: The time for sharing information expertise is now."  That sounds good to me.  From the article:  Educators in the 21st century must prepare stu-  dents effectively for productive use of information, especially on the postsecondary level. Students will need to graduate from higher education institutions with the appropriate information skills to allow them to become productive citizens in the workplace and in society. Technology is having a major impact on society; in economics, e-business is moving to the forefront; in communication, e-mail, the Internet, and cellular phones have reformed how people communicate; in the work environment, computers and Web utilizations are emphasized; and in education, virtual learning and teaching are becoming more important. These are a few examples of how the 21st- century information environment requires future members of the workforce to be information fluent so they:  - have the ability to locate information efficiently.   - evaluate information for specific needs.   - organize information to address issues.   - apply information skillfully to solve problems.   - use information to communicate effectively.   - use information responsibly to ensure a productive work environment.   Individuals can achieve information fluency by acquiring cultural, visual, computer, technology, research, and information management skills to enable them to think critically.
