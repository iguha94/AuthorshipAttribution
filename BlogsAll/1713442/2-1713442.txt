  						     Learning and Teaching on the Web  I am an editor at  Academic Exchange Quarterly  and I am currently solicating submissions for manuscripts on dealing with the web.  Here is the CFP:  The emergence of the World Wide Web has changed the way that information is disseminated and the manner in which faculty and students seek to acquire it. How do librarians and faculty best instruct students in the ways to find credible information online? What are the best methods for teaching students to evaluate what they find on the Web and become educated information consumers? Further, what are the best ways for faculty to place information on the Web for student use? How does placing a course online change the needs of students who are seeking information? Contributions are welcome from many perspectives, including those dealing with: library user education, teaching competencies, distance education courses, models of instruction, teaching technology, information skills, web instruction issues for administrators, librarian/faculty collaboration, and various others.   Who May Submit: Those who work with students and are responsible for teaching using the web or who teach students how to evaluate information found on the web. This can include classroom faculty, librarians, graduate students, and academic staff. Individuals who have developed and/or taught an online course would also be welcome to submit. Further, submissions are sought from administrators who have dealt with issues relating to teaching and learning on the web.   Click on the link above for info on how to submit.
