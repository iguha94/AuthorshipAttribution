  						     Is This Really Mean?   Sheila Webber at  Information Literacy Weblog  posted this last week.  She notes that  Academic Exchange Quarterly  is having a special issue on information literacy.  She then ends by writing, "The downside of this journal for authors seems to be that, though it is peer-reviewed, authors don't get any sort of free copy of their article unless their library subscribes. Now that's what I call mean."  Mind you, my title at  AEQ  is Executive Editor but that stills make me stop and shake my head.  It is nice when a journal sends you a complimentary copy when you publish an article.  But this is not always the case.  I published an article last fall in  Illinois Libraries .  I was sent a link to an online version of the journal.  I was not sent a paper copy of the journal.  I published an article last year in  Research Strategies .  Elseiver did not send me a copy of the journal either.  Are all of these publishers mean?  Further, AEQ is rather inexpensive.  The no "free copy" results from journal's  broader policy objectives.   Academic Exchange Quarterly  keeps annual subscription  low, $156, and does not  offer free author copy.  Other journals like   Cambridge Journal of Education  keep annual subscription high,  $509, and  offer free author copy. Which  policy is better for majority of educators? Which is better for library budgets?  Is  AEQ  mean for not giving free copies to authors?  I think not.
