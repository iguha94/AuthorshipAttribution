  						     Library Instruction as Conducted by Student Workers: A Personal Reflection  Many of us in higher education have student workers conduct simple library instruction sessions be it tours or basic OPAC instruction for freshman.  This is true at Central Michigan University as well.  I asked one of my students to write an article about her experiences.  Here is the result.  From the article:  " Library instructions have always been taught by the librarians from my experience and when a group of us were told that teaching those sessions were going to be a part of our duties it was surprising and a little nerve wrecking.  As with most, I was not one to feel comfortable in front of a group, so to say the least I was a tad nervous.  After being told that we were now going to be doing these sessions we were trained on how to do them.  All of us had already seen many of the instructional sessions before so the concept was not all that new.  We were given a sheet that read like a script which was going to be what we would teach.  I read through the sheet and it did not look challenging and it set me at ease.  Everything that we were to instruct was so second nature and there was nothing new to be learned.  One of the nicer aspects of the library instructional sessions conducted by students is that the groups that we teach are never at a level higher than we are studying.  The groups that the students teach are at the 101 level of courses, high school students, or visiting groups not affiliated with the university.  For those reasons the instructional sessions that we teach are basic introductions to Central Michigan University's home page and the library itself."
