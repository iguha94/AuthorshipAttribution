  						     Despair, Inc.  I have always been a fan of Dilbert.  Even though I am now in middle management, I still appreciate the truths the strip uncovers and makes evident.  (Although decisions that seem dumb to you make sense when you have all the secret facts which usually can't be discussed!)  Despair Inc. sells products to inspire people to be there worst at work.  Here is a quote from the site:  "For longer than most can remember, motivational speakers, authors and publishers have inspired and delighted us by championing the idea that within each person exists virtually unlimited potential.   At Despair, Inc., we agree wholeheartedly- and helping others to unleash their hidden potentials remains our singular obsession.   Think about it- what hidden potentials exist within YOU?   Perhaps you're a wholly reasonable person, with the potential to become an irrational fool?  Perhaps you're a team player, with a potentially argumentative loner lurking about inside you?  Or perhaps you're a dreamer, within whom lives a potentially disillusioned grouse, simply waiting to take flight on the wings of bitterness?"  What a great idea!  "You can do anything you set your mind to when you have vision, determination, and an endless supply of expendable labor."  This quote is framed with a great pyramid in the background.  Should I buy this and post it on my door?  Would my librarians mind?
