I have become a deadbeat father to my web page.  As you can see, I haven't done jack or shit to make the appearance of my page any better.  There are a number of excuses I can use that pretty much lead into the concept of not alot of time.  Mondays and Tuesdays are eaten up by school, Wednesday is a dead day to me because I feel like it's Friday coming off my hellish start to the week.  Thursday, maybe, but only if I don't go visit friends.  Friday usually isn't an option cause I leave for the corn fields to visit mi novia, where I don't do anything Saturday or Sunday web related either.  "Committing crime" is much more enjoyable with a person.  So you see my dilemma, my complete inability to sink myself into a world of action figures, paper plates, Slurpee and Slim Jim snack times.  As much as I really would love to dive into that realm and live absorb more code.  Maybe one day but not now.  I told   KYLE  my plans were to burn my site to the ground and let nature take its course, that is if I can find the HTML to do such a thing.  Please be patient.  I know my blogs have sucked as of late and the page looks like the same old crap that everyone else is doing (if your page looks like mine, I'm sorry and it's time for you to go learn something new) but if I can finish Kyle's playground, I can go   TRON  on my new page (that's right, I just made TRON a verb...and I see "TRON 2.0" is in the Hollywood grinding machine, s w e e t).  Summing up this blog...sit down, and shut up.  Thank you, - The Damn Management
