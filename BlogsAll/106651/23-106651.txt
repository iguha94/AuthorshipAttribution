There's a store in Dekalb called Downtown Disks where they have used tapes and CD's for almost free if you can find the ones you're looking for.  They also have new CD's too.  I've been on the hunt for "Being There" by   Wilco .  It's a 2 CD set and pretty much concreted itself into my all time top ten albums.  I had already heard the album, I borrowed a ripped copy from my English teacher a few months back.  It's my belief that you never really listen to an album until you're alone and driving in a car.  When it's just you and that CD.  Anyway, these are the lyrics to track one, disk one...   Misunderstood   by Wilco    When you're back in your old neighborhood The cigarettes taste so good But you're so misunderstood You're so misunderstood  There's something there that you can't find Honest when you're tellin' a lie You hurt her but you don't know why You love her but you don't know why  Short on long term goals There's a party there that we oughtta go to Do you still love rock and roll? Do you still love rock and roll?  It's only a quarter to three Reflecting off your C.D. You're looking at a picture of me You're staring at a picture of me  Take the guitar player for a ride He ain't never been satisfied He thinks he owes some kind of debt Be years before he gets over it  There's a fortune inside your head All you touch turns to lead You think you might just crawl back in bed The fortune inside your head  You know you're just a mama's boy Positively unemployed So misunderstood So misunderstood  I know you're gotta God shaped hole Leanin' out your of your window So misunderstood I'd like to thank you all for nothin' I'd like to thank you all for nothin' at all I'd like to thank you all for nothin' Nothin' Nothin' at all Nothin' Nothin' at all
