JUST NOT COOL   I received my mega-huge   ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY  this Saturday proclaiming that inside, held the list of the 100 "  IT " people in Hollywood.  Upon further inspection, there apparently was an "IT" category for EVERYTHING.  Even the character "Aki" from the upcoming CGI flick "  FINAL FANTASY " made the damn list.  I swear I saw "IT Studio Janitor" and "IT   MOVIE  That Was Made that Will Make a Ton of Money for Some Reason and Send the Quality of the Film Industry Back Another Ten Years."  Obviously with such a thorough list of "it" categories, I am saddened than not once did myself or any of my   CREW  make the list.  So Ive made my own it list as an addendum (bet you didnt know I knew that word) to the Entertainment Weekly list.  - IT Guy That Poses the Largest Nuclear Threat to the Midwest   JASON BRUEN   - "IT Chick That Poses the Ability to Stop the Largest Nuclear Threat to the Midwest"   UMA SWAMY   - IT Guy Who is Unknowingly the Heir to the Playboy Publishing Empire   JEFF EICHHORN   - IT Guy You Have a Hard Time Believing You Envy As Much As You Do   KYLE FORD   - IT Chick That You Probably Dont Talk to As Much As You Should   SARAH FINIFROCK   - IT Chick You Probably Dont Get to See As Much As You Should   CONNIE SOMMERVILLE   - "IT Man Possessing More  INTENSITY  Than A Supernova"   ROBERT PATRICK
