I was standing in the train station this afternoon waiting to board the train home.  It was hot in the station and I was bundled in winter coat and scarf so I was already feeling odd.  Suddenly I felt dizzy, I felt my body rock back on to my heels and a surge of heat consumed me inside my coat.  Everything felt fake, people were two dimensional and I felt invisible.  I ran an internal systems check on myself to see if I could figure out what was wrong.  No sniffles, no body aches, no head aches...uh oh.  Stomach.  I was starving, ravenous is a better word for it.  With three dollars to my name, I couldn't even by a crappy burger from McDonald's.  Starvation.  I climbed on the train figuring I would last another hour, boy was I wrong.  The first thing I noticed was my hands, I was trying to read and they were shaking real bad, it's creepy.  Eventually I couldn't read because my stomach was just screaming at my dumb ass.  For the last two months since school started, my body has taken a beating.  I lost ten pounds that I couldn't afford to lose in the first week of school alone, and I'm not sure what I weigh now but it can't be good.  I need to eat, I know this, but I don't have time.  I guess that's a bad excuse though.  At least I'm not avoiding eating and hiding food in walls like a Lifetime Tracy Gold special...
