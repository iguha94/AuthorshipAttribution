Wow...back to reality.  Great.  I would like to apologize for the lack of blogs this weekend, it's not like I wasn't around or super busy, I just kinda...forgot.  Friday night I spent redoing my webpage and making it the way I wanted it.  I was very proud of myself for coding something like that when I'm an HTML tenderfoot.  Anyway, I thought she was about good to go...then Kyle brought to my attention that it doesn't load AT ALL in Netscape (love that Netscape...primates).  So, back to the drawing board.  Saturday morning Bru bought the parts to his SAM site.  I'm a bit envious because my computer is slowly dying I think and I'd like to upgrade a few things.  But of course, upgrade = money, which I have none of.  Saturday night Con and I joined up with Uma and Bruen to go see "What Women Want."  Pretty good movie, I'm not a big fan of Helen Hunt (after all she did marry an Azaria, divorce noted, but still...).  We didn't get to go to an early show, so we tried to grab some snackage at UNO's in Vernon Hills.  Our waiter was a monkey.  He took our orders on a napkin.  M-O-N-K-E-Y.  Sunday, I slugged around some more.  I installed The Sims which is just a horribly addictive game to build a house for these people and let them loose to do their thing.  Kinda funny too.  If you don't build them a bathroom, the pee their pants.  If you don't feed them, they die.  Nasty little game really.  Later, Con came over and we watched X-Files, pretty cool episode, I was disappointed to NOT see Doggett kick ass on the alternate level of consciousness.  Should be a LONG weekend, today is the last day of school then I'm back to full time work for a while.  I bet you can sense the excitement.  Yip-figgin-ie.  Waiting for Friday...
