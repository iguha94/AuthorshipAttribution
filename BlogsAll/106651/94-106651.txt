WELL CALL ME MR. BUTTERFINGERS   Within the corporate cubicle community, it's a sure thing that people will try to decorate their areas with personal items or any small, sad relic that somehow makes them feel like being at work is ALMOST like being at home. These people are called "sad."  But that's getting off track. I work within the confines of what is the "Health & Safety" department of my HUGE corporation. Someone dies on the job, we know about it. Someone severs a limb, we know about it. Someone gets a papercut, we know about it. You get my point. Essentially, we keep track of the people who think sticking their arms in heavy machinery is a good way to fix it. We're also the ones who say, "Don't touch those sharp edges," and "Don't run with vats of acid." Okay, I'm still off track.  The lady who sits in the cube next to me ventured off to Seattle one weekend and found herself in a store that dealt in oddity antiques. She came across a mirror that she purchased and then quietly hung in her cubicle. The mirror itself is surrounded by eight illustrations: a man with his arm stuck in a meat grinder, a man with his wrist being severed by a   band saw , a man being electrocuted by power lines, an explosion at a factory, molten steel raining on a couple of guys (my personal favorite), a box at a shipyard about to crush some workers, a plane wreck, and a sinking boat that just happened to be in shark infested waters.  I've linked a few pictures so that you can see the carnage up close.     1  |   2  |   3
