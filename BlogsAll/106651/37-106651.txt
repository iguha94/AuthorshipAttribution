My cubicle-friend "C" has been pushing my level of comfort lately.  Not like he's hitting on me or anything, noooo.  But this week he's done two things that have quickly clawed at my nerves.  The first being that "C" has changed his coffee within the last two weeks.  I don't know what he was drinking before but I wish he'd go back to it.  I can't even tell you what flavor it is but the aroma fills the cubicle.  Now you're probably thinking, "Coffee has a nice smell."  Yes it does, but this coffee smells like coffee and mud.  It takes him two hours to drink it and then he throws the empty cup in the garbage next to me.  I can still smell it.  The second thing occured yesterday.  It seems "C" sustained a knee injury...while SQUARE DANCING.  How does one get injured while SQUARE DANCING?  It got worse though.  Not only did he confer with a number of people here about his injury, but he began calling other square-dancers and talking about THEIR injuries.  I was like, "Je-sus!  Is this like combat square dancing?"  The thing that "C" said that almost made me go home was he said (talking on the phone to another member of the square-dancing injured reserve), "Yeah, you know.  I do alot of twisting and quick jerking on the floor."  Oh God.  He asked me if I was "tired about hearing him complain about his knee."  I said no and that I was hardly paying attention.  What I really wanted to tell him was to some degree I call myself a hockey player, I have no sympathy for a SQUARE-DANCER!  Ugh.  I want my cubicle back.
