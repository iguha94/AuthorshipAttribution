More pictures from the   STICK BUS  excursion this December.  Oh!  And that reminds me,   SARAH  added the pictures she had also, they can be found in her "about" section.  As the last time, each pic will be coupled with a caption...  Okay,   CONNIE AND I  really have to get our happy faces coordinated.  In every picture of us, one is smiling and the other looks tormented...hmm...maybe it's an underlying message about the relationship...OUCH!  Just kidding Con!  I like   THIS  picture except for the moron on the right sticking his ugly mug into the mix.  I'm really getting tired of this.  Every time   JEFF  takes a picture with someone else's girl (Uma seen here) it comes out better than pictures with their boyfriend.  There's a danger to eating 95 floors above the earth.    BRU  exemplifies said designated danger here.    JEFF AND SARAH  discussing the finer points of martini selection.    KYLE AND I  strike a pose.  I go for the "damn sexy" look, Kyle choose "deer in headlights."  He chose...poorly...  I'm putting another picture of me in this just for fun.  It was taken a long time ago, probably about two or three years now.  Kelly took this picture of me at the now infamous Max & Erma's long before Connie started working there.  It was in our usual booth, I remember I was eating an ice cream sunday.  I know it's one of Kelly's favorite pics...so   HERE  it is...  That's all for now I think, I just dropped off some pics from an ice skating get together we had Friday night, I should have those by Wednesday and if there are any good ones you know I'll post them.  Thanks for the scanner Jeff, I feel like I need to scan the WORLD!
