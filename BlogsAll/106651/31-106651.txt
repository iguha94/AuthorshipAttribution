Riding on the train tonight, the car I was in was empty.  It got kind of surreal on me.  I was tired, listening to the melodic hums of Swedish rock and I closed my eyes.  And in the second they were closed I thought of everything that I wanted to be there when I opened them.  Friends, lovers, warm sun, an escape.  I wanted to float forever, sun at my back, earth at my belly, the important things wrapped in my arms.  Just floating at the speed of light...   Velvet   by Kent    My skin feels strange like theres something underneath And its aching to be free Try to think of something else In my mind, imagination running wild I try to shut my eyes Try to hide it with a lie But Im running out of time  You and I move at the speed of light One step a time We don't have to run You and I move at the speed of light And with our smiles We outshine the sun  Your skin feels strange like theres something underneath I can feel its breath Warm upon my neck And in our minds imagination running wild So when we shut our eyes  Were running out of time And all of this is lies   And maybe all of that wasn't right there when I opened my eyes, but I knew it was around me and hidden in the feathers of the wings I never get to show on my back.  No shoes...just glide...  Crap kid...what did I tell you about writing after midnight...?
