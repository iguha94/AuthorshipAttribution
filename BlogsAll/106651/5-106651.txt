The first pictures from the First Annual Stick Bus Reunion were developed yesterday.  I scanned them in and they are now available for public viewing.  I'll intro each pic with a quick caption...here we go!  The best will be saved for last.  New winter fasions...a tie made of real   MONKEY .  Call security, looks like these   THUGS  are waiting to rough up 6 year-olds for their Mold-A-Rama wax dinos.    JEFF  says, "Hot damn, that Egypt exhibit just plum tuckered me out."  Was it really the exhibit Jeff?  I don't really think so...  Sometimes for fun,   KYLE  takes homeless women to the museum and shows them what they could be doing if they would clean their lives up.  Apparently,   JEFF and CONNIE  have been messing around behind Dave's back.  Here's a picture of   DAVE  when he found them smootchin'.  Dave soon realized thought that he is no match for   JEFF'S  level of manliness...    FREAKS .  That's exactly what Uma was thinking.    CONNIE  is working very hard to be in the "Charlie's Angels" sequel.  Look, she has the whole slow-motion-hair-bounce-thing goin' on!  Bru and Uma...  BRUMA .    LUNCH ...about as exciting as it looks.  There's no picture to this caption, but I know what everyone is waiting to see...    JEFF  enjoys getting all dressed up for special occasions...like waiting for a locksmith to get his keys out of his car...  Looks like   KYLE  packed his ANGRY eyes!  Over yonder horizon...is where   JEFF  sees an Irish Pub!    CONNIE  makes this face when she's tired of hearing Dave talk and would really like to go home and get away from him...  Okay...now the pics we've all been waiting for...  First in the collection of naked bronze people, was this   LADY .  Then Kyle took a picture of this   YOUNG MAN .  And finally, here is   KYLE  looking enviously at the bronze wanker...  Wow...the memories we capture on film...
