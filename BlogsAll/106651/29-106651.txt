Ouch.  My body is still yelling at me from this weekend and to tell you the truth I don't remember sleeping at all.  Not because we partied or anything, I just never sleep well when I'm away.  I feel like a bus ran over me...followed by a Lincoln Navigator, followed by a Chevy Blazer, followed by a Cadillac El Dorado, followed by any make of Saturn followed by a Geo Metro, followed by a Chinese guy on a bike like you see in Chinatown, followed by a fat kid on rollerblades.  It's bad.  Today I have to go back to school in which I'm willing to bet a majority of the class does not show.  I also might have to work today but if I can't catch the right train the I can't work because I have a dentist appointment later this even to get a filling replaced.  What a way to start the new year, 'eh?  Needless to say, I'm damn tired and now I gotta go run my goddamn frozen ass all over the city of Chicago with a sinus infection hanging in my chest and then I might have to go to work only to have someone stick sharp cleaning tools into a hole in my mouth.  What does that spell?  If you guessed "fun" then you're  HORRIBLY WRONG .  I hope New Year's recovery went better for my pals, I'm the blogs will appear later this afternoon from them.  Anyway, I'm signing off now...  Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain...
