AND IF YOU'RE THE QUEEN OF CALIFORNIA, BABY I AM THE KING OF THE RAIN  Me, I love the rain.  Especially when it's warm enough to hit your face and not bother you.  I love the sound of thunderstorms, I love the sight of lightning.  I love the smell that comes in the air before and after a storm.  We actually had our first spring thunderstorm tear through a few nights ago and I had my windows open and slept so well.  But today, the rain pisses me off.  Well, not actually the rain, but people talking about the rain.  It's like just because it hasn't rained in four months (well, as much as it did this morning) people have to dust off the old cliches and get updates every two minutes.  "Staying dry Dave?"  "Did you get wet Dave?"  "Is it still raining Dave?"  "Where's your umbrella Dave?"  Damnit, leave me alone.  Of course I got wet, that's what rain does...makes things wet.  And how would I know if it's still raining?  Do you bastards let me look out the window?  No.  Go look yourself, freaks.  And I don't have an umbrella because I like the rain, I'm not afraid to get wet.  I'll dry, life goes on.  You'd think rain was like the social event of the season.  It also doesn't help that on Wednesdays I'm usually crabby and tired anyway so the stupidity of their questions only enrages me more.  And I know it's ridiculous to get nuts over something so trivial, but like you've never done it before...  Let me enjoy my rain.
