JUNK E-MAIL   This junk e-mail thing is finally starting to get on my nerves.  I didn't get to check my AOL e-mail all weekend and I returned home to 30 messages waiting.  Only three were worth my time (one of them I had sent to myself as a reminder).  It seems like most of my friends have already changed e-mail names at least once to escape the deluge of "virgin girls" and "free viagra."  I just don't understand this business tactic at all.  Why the hell would I every trust a product that was advertised to me via e-mail?  Especially when it comes from some garbled, worthless e-mail address.  The latest trend that is pissing me off in regards to junk mail is subject lines that make you think it's a real e-mail.  For example, this morning in my hotmail junk folder (I have to check to make sure nothing good slipped through) there was an e-mail with the subject, "Wait!  You forgot to message me back!"  Of course it was from an e-mail I didn't recognize but to exercise my point here, I opened it.  It was an ad to see Jennifer Love Hewitt and Anna Kournikova in "shocking fotos."  That's right, "fotos."  Another example, I have an e-mail titled, "RE: Your Inquiry" from another crap address.  This ad told me, "You were referred to me today as someone who is seeking a financial miracle. If this is true please continue - I promise this will be worth your time!"  Right.  First of all, I never made any inquiries so I'm not going to bite.  Second of all, I do need a financial miracle, however I'm not stupid enough to follow this e-mail for help.  And the saddest part is there are people out there who open these.  They're too stupid to go, "Gee, I don't know anyone with the e-mail oiledteen5361@wildoats.com, but it says it's regarding the message I sent.  I should open it."  It's these same morons that get e-mails here at work titled "I love you" and open them to release viruses onto our servers.  What the hell is wrong with people?
