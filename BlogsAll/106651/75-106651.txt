OVERPASS   crawling home  the street lamps dotted the black sky  they lined the night like a flipped runway  around me the ghosts were driving red cadillacs  and the big memories were riding little scooters   the traffic was packed on the off-ramps  the trailer trucks crowded the shoulders  my suspension rode easy  across the gaps in the pavement  the speed grabbed at my antenna   unhappiness fought inside my engine  under the roar were the whispers of pistons  firing up and down  pulling me forward  telling me i was wrong for leaving   time stretches and doubles  the sleep in my eyes blurs the road into the 405  the cold autumn wind squeezes in  through a cracked read window it bites my neck and snaps me back to the 294   i'm awake to the fact  that my mind is so everywhere  that i feel stuck going nowhere  the odometer just counts miles in the wrong direction  around me the fears were driving gold hondas  the hopes were in the distance walking on foot   the driving forces my mind to move just as fast  emptiness stretches and doubles  the sunroof is open  the moon shines through the street lamps  the dashboard glows blue   i should have stopped for gas thirty miles ago  but that would have made the trip worse  with the engine roar gone i'd be thinking clearly  and wanting to go back  to where i'm now allowed to be right now   i hate the distance where a phone call seems so quick  but a trip feels like days  what little strength i have left  from the addiction of sleepless nights  is beaten on by memories  behind me my dreams were piled in buses  and the tomorrows were in station wagons  somewhere in a memorized pattern of left turns and right turns i make my way back to my room knowing that it's not where i'm supposed to be and i'm sure not supposed to be alone  i left my bags on the floor  eighty-five miles back in a room  along with socks and shirts  there's a clichd heart in a jar  on a nightstand next to a book  under a light  and close to a sleeping girl  all the way i know that my love is riding next to me wearing a bright yellow coat and driving faster than i ever could
