There is he is.  My StorTrooper.  And in an almost frighting way, my digital me looks almost way to close to the real me.  That's a little unsettling that my features and identity could be so easily converted to 0's and 1's and turned into something cold and hexidecimal.  I'm sure I'll cope.

You take chicken for example, maybe they couldn't figure out what to make chicken taste like, which is why chicken tastes like everything. Maybe couldn't figure out...
