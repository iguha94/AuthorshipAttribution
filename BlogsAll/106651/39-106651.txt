Here's the skinny, no hold barred.  I  hate   LOATHE  MTV.  I won't get into this debate right now, but needless to say a network cancellation is in order.  ANYWAY, my babe   CONNIE  tells me this morning that she saw the new Fatboy Slim video for their song "Weapon of Choice."   Pause   I paused here to remind people that so of us at   STICK BUS  have a following with   CHRISTOPHER WALKEN .  Ala, "Can Tag: The Movie" which I don't think is online anymore.   Play   So Connie tells me the entire Fatboy Slim video is Walken, dancing and flying around an empty hotel.  My first reaction was disbelief, my second reaction was that it had to be the best music video ever made.  I got home from work and went to   MTV.COM  (which is THE most frustrating site EVER) and I see the video is on their front page but in shitty RealVideo (frustrating site, frustrating technology).  I tried to watch it, but gave up.  So I resorted to television and watching MTV.  Before long (thank GOD) the video came on...I almost died.  Somewhere in that video I swear I saw Jesus.  It's Walken at his best and it's the ONLY thing that's making me watch MTV right now is because I need to see it again.  Look for it, I promise, you too will be in awe...
