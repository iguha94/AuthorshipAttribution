LAST NIGHT   Last night I was flipping channels and for the first time in almost two days, not sticking to MSNBC, CNN, or ABC.  I landed on South Park and only watched a few moments, but I laughed.  And laughing felt so weird since my heart had been so heavy for the past few days.  I guess it's a sign of moving on.  I won't forget though, not even here, miles away in Chicago.  I placed a flag I recieved from school on my desk and printed and posted   Poje's  splash page up where everyone could see it.  I don't know why this hit me as deep as it did.  I didn't lose anyone in this, but I feel like my pride has been stripped and kicked and burned.  I wish I could have done something more than donate cash or blood.  Changing gears a little, these images and thoughts have generated nightmares when I sleep.  Last night I was wondering the halls of some educational type forum and I was following closely behind the Bargi (I don't remember if that's the right spelling...don't really care) twins, who looked to me and said, "Hey, are you going to come hang out?" to which I replied, "You didn't talk to me through four years of high school, don't start now."  And I walked away.  Sad that I even loathe my long gone L.H.S. classmates YEARS after it's all been over.
