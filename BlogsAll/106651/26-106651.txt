I bought my plane tickets to Los Angeles today, I'll be visiting Kyle and Sarah and Krycek The Dog at the end of the month.  Of course who would I be without reminding Kyle that someone owes him a tour that could convienently take place when I'm there.  We could take Krycek (who I plan to train to growl at site of Rupert).  Anyway, all was going well until I noticed that my departure time FROM Los Angeles is at 6 in the morning.  Damnit, that is NOT going to happen.  I have to call and get that fixed.  Okay, here's a relationship problem I have.  I don't smoke yet I have a "Nails" Zippo lighter (replica of the one used in Dogma) and I cherish that lighter very much.  I passed the icon onto Connie hoping she would take good care of it also.  Well it had run out of gas again so I figured I would fill it up while I was at her house.  I totally forgot until I was leaving.  I went into her car (she doesn't know I did this yet) and dug around for the lighter.  Eventually, I found it...covered in dried sticky soda with candy wrappers stuck to it...UNACCEPTABLE.  We're going to have a little one-on-one about this one, I'm sure...  NOTE TO STICK BUS MEMBERS:  If I can find time this week I will be doing the rocket science involved in breaking down the Chicago adventure.  I know for some of us this doesn't come at a good time but a $1200 credit card bill NEVER comes at a good time...
