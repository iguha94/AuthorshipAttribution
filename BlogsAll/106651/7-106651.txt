This weekend was GREAT.  The 7 of us hit Chicago and really had a good time.  For my entertainment and possible that of others, I'm going to post our entire expense report from this weekend or what I can remember us spending...oh, and pictures will be coming shortly.  Friday, December 22nd - Dinner at the Signature Room on the 95th Floor of the Hancock building.  Needless to say, and I will, when you look out the windows and you can see the every little light in Chicago and the lights of Indiana to the south, you can only mutter, "Holy shit."  We were seated in the north-east corner of the building between two panes of glass.  It was a NICE view.  The place was AWESOME and the food was really good.  Our waiter was Survivors Richard Hatch.  Anyway, the following list is what the 7 of us consumed and drank.    $11.50   2 Coronas   $17.25   3 Beck's Dark   $24.00   3 Jack Daniels (for the Manhattans)   $2.25   3 Manhattans   $16.00   2 Brushettas   $11.00   1 Scallops   $75.00   3 Salmon   $60.00   2 New York Strip Steaks   $24.00   1 Sauted Chicken Breast   $26.00   1 Red Snapper   $8.00   2 Boiled Potatoes   $5.00   1 Whipped Potato   $12.00   2 Asparagus Sides   $19.00   2 Glass Merlot Rutherford   $5.00   2 Dinner Coffees   $7.00   1 Chocolate Cheesecake   $8.00   1 Ireland Coffee   $7.25   1 Seven & Seven   $8.00   1 Bailey's   $8.75   1 Cosmopolitan   SUBTOTAL $355.00 GRATUITY $63.90 TAXES $34.60 T O T A L $453.50    That's only the beginning, time to add hotel rooms...    $447.00   3 hotel rooms   $58.00   2 vehicle parking   $53.19   State tax on rooms   $13.41   City tax on rooms   $2.54   Telephone call   $4.00   Valet tip   TOTAL $578.14    Saturday afternoon, we went to the field museum    $56.00   7 student basic admissions with Star Wars exhibit admission   $30.00   Estimated Sum of McDonalds lunch (crap, flashbacklemme finish).   $8.00   One stuffed monkey courtesy of Uma   $4.00   Total price of 4 wax dinosaurs from Mold-A-Rama machines   TOTAL $98.00    SO, lets do the math here real quick:   TOTAL $1129.64   and   $1031.64   of that is sitting comfortably on my credit card right now, and needless to say Ill be figuring out prices per team this weekend.  Nice.  Of course the grand total only reflects events done as a group, a member to remain unnamed adds an additional   $153.00   to the total making the  ACTUAL  weekend cost (not including gas)   $1282.64  .  And as for that flashback, Connies roommate Mary once had a very nice dinner prepared for her and her boyfriend Jeff.  The dinner was of the romantic type and the next day, they went to McDonalds for lunch.  I made fun of Mary for that because in my eyes the romantic dinner was instantly negated by the horrid flavor combos of McDonalds.  Well, I would like to officially apologize to Mary for making fun of that situation for I seem to have done the same thing.  Took Con to a really nice place for dinnerMcCrapolds for lunch the next day.  Just part of bein a playa, yo.
