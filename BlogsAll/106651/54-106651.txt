LOST AND BLOG   There are a few blogs which belong to my   friends  that have fallen into the void of dead blogs.  While the blogs themselves aren't dead, I fear that the authors may be.  Or as I have explained before, wrapped in a conspiracy of zombies, holograms, and actresses playing wives.    Sarah Finifrock/Ford  Last transmission -  Friday, June 01, 2001   Sarah was involved in our conspiracy earlier where I made the claims that "Sarah" was only an actress who was hired by   Kyle  in order to create the image that he was married and advance himself in his career field (see the sitcom failure, "  Ned & Stacey " for reference).  There has been little contact with "Sarah" and the lack of blogging remains a mystery.  Her second to last blog is paraphrased below:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday, April 16, 2001  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all right, fine. all of you can turn your back on blogs now that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they've become mainstream, just like all the r.e.m. fans who &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decided they weren't so cool anymore after "losing my &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;religion" hit #1--- but i'm RIDING IT OUT.  i'm sticking with the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blogger b/c there's no easier way to update my site and keep &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it fresh.    Jeff Eichhorn  Last transmission -  Monday, May 14, 2001   As everyone is aware, Jeff is dead.  He is a corpse which must be constantly reanimated when his services are needed.  Obviously he hasn't blogged because there is no internet in the afterlife.  In the second to last blog, Jeff commented on his "massive nuts."  He later posted the following which would lead me to think   Bruen  may have killed him.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two things tonight.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) I'd first like to say that the Go Go's are quite possibly the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greatest thing since the Romans. The really amazing thing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is that Bruen likes the Go Go's. I mean, I thought for sure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he would HATE them, but in fact he is quite fond of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rockin' ladies. I'm so proud of him for admitting it, and if he &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wants to go with me to the record store tomorrow to buy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their new album I will most certainly oblige. We'll talk about &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the FREE concert the Go Go's are playing at the Taste of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chicago later.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Fox Mulder is paramount. Intensity whatever....    Connie Sommerville  Last transmission -  Wednesday, May 09, 2001   Connie was last reported to be only a holographic image in which I have created to give the effect that I still have a girlfriend.  I cannot write anymore information  because there is a currently a court case involving this situation.  Connie's last statement was the following:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So tonight I say, "Fare thee well" DeKalb. I shall not return until a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hot and steamy August day. I say adios to my neighbors and to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;810 Kimberly.My new luxury suite awaits me. I complained and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bitched but deep down I hope all my friends knew that I really &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did like it here.  This was my first taste of freedom and it tasted &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good. I can always appreciate DeKalb for that freedom it gave to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me that no other place has been able to do so far. My room is all &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;packed, the floor is bare, and the walls are too white and its sad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had good times in this place no matter what we say. And this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place will forever be, my first apartment...the first place my wings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were able to spread. But I say this as I know that I am coming &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back and that this is only the beginning. It has nothing to do with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my age, or where I am in life, I think that we all need that place &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where we are what is truly inside us. We are not only the memories &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that people have of us and refuse to let go of us. So this is for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone...near or far, no matter where you are in life. I say this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to all of you, "A person is made of integrity not of delusions and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;memories. Be true to yourself so that you are true to others." I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love you all.  Perhaps one day, the riddles to why these fine young blog authors have disappeared will be solved and we will once again return to a world with blogs about   Porn Czars , ghetto talk from the   cornfields , and one's massive   genitals .
