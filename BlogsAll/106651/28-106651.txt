Kyle and I were kidding around last night, there is some new   X-FILES  information coming to light today (I of course, know NOTHING).  We spiraled off into a semi-comical conversation about acting on the "X."  Yet, sadly, if I had any talent or power, I really think that this idea would work (so I here I go, putting it on the internet where anyone can get their hands on it, there must be some way I can say, BOOM, my idea).  I think the date and timestamp of the blog will suffice for that (take that you legal bastards!).  ANYWAY, my idea was this, and I know it has some flaws.  Why haven't they had some hotshot, trigger-happy rookie get into the mix yet?  He or she (or a team) could be straight from the academy, perhaps they've heard of Mulder and take similar interests.  They want to be part of the X-Files but they don't have the discipline or patience to investigate, instead they always show up with guns blazing.  They could be the "wrong-place, wrong-time" people.  I know that the show might be beginning to be bogged down with characters, but I think my idea could fly.  They don't need to be every episode characters, just show up enough to piss people off when they screw up real bad.  Example:  Mulder is about to exit the craft in which he is being held captive, Doggett and Scully watch nearby.  Suddenly from the bushes comes gunfire directed toward the craft.  The craft closes and retreats, Mulder is taken, and it's all because of this(these) hotshot(s).  Perhaps they even work for Deputy Director Kersh since his pet-project in Doggett fell through.  Who else is better to do your work and ruin anything than a quick-triggered duo?  OOOH!  Forget their involvement with Kersh...they work for someone else...they work for on Cigarette Smoking Man!  You hear that Carter!  Bring the pain, big boy!  Of course the only stipulation to this idea is that the punk team be played by   Sarah Finifrock  and myself.  Of course...
