I got busted with AOL Instant Messenger on my computer at work about an hour ago.  The company I work for (which again will remain unamed) is really beginning to annoy me with their primative rules.  There is such a limit of communication in corporate workplaces today, it's amazing anyone makes money.  Actually, the company I work for lost quite a LARGE chunk of money because their communication was terrible.  Dress codes, assigned arrival times, cubicles, shitty cafeteria food.  Jesus, it's a labor camp, not an office.  Everyone watches what everyone else does, and management is...well it's ridiculous.  They all have little drones they can push their work onto and then look good at performance bonus time cause the drones busted their asses.  How is it that such a large company continues to be so large with such terrible and antiqued control systems and technology?  The e-mail system here...Lotus Notes...weak.  For those of you who don't know, Lotus Notes is like sending e-mail via cave painting.  Sadly, they will never learn their lesson, too many people in high places unwilling to shake things up.  I guess that fear comes when you let an employment force of babboons send things to the FDA and in turn lose 165 million dollars...idiots.  It's all about what the suits want and they want money.  Of course there are some of them who are human, but for the most part they are all cash-hungry dogs who will piss on anyone to get that cash.
