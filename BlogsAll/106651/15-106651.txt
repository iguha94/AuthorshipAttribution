whispers loud and clear   by dave sliozis   i still hear your laughter in the echoes of these pillows and the beat of your heart loud and clear over the engine  the handprints on the wall to remind me that you were everywhere in the driveway, in the hallway trying hard to lose yourself  i was there, lined up behind the eight keeping watch over you from the smoke the same roads that paved our way there will help us find the way out  nights of hours logged and recorded creating a box to keep it all in the nights where all you can be is a whisper wrapped in sheets  the way we crashed keeps me awake the warmth of the summer that brought you the mud on my tires and on the windows reminds me there is more to come  red lights stretching out the roads a park collecting grass stains breakfast and the beach your arms the final stop  i stumbled hard once and my guilt still remains broken heart in my lungs cutting me and reminding me when i breathe you  blue eyes closed to the light of a tv small hands curled tightly around my arm i forget how good it feels for you to have a little faith in me  you're keeping together a patchwork heart of memories and nightmares everything i know and wish everything i am and ever was  nights ending when the sun came up days beginning when the sun went down how could i say no to you when you have denied me nothing  the wind blew me back via chicago in the middle of the night and i count all the promises i make with every mile that passes  feet and knees, elbows and hands the girl you want to be, the girl you are i'm sorry if i bruised you sometimes i can't let go  years to go miles to drive wishes to make and we'll watch them pass tangled together and laughing at lizard kisses i just want to hold your hand when we fly away  the stars are just as beautiful in the west the hopes are just as loud that summer breeze that carried you across will be back to help you find me  watching from the back of the theater the empty seat next to me smells of a cigarette i can wait for you there next to the exit in the flicker of a marquee  keeping sober from the rain and out of the shadows i'll be the boy with his heart in a jar wet shoes and soaked beliefs i'll be the boy keeping warm in the spotlight  i still hear your laughter in the negatives of these memories and the beat of your heart loud and clear over the world
