HAPPY BIRTHDAY EMPIRE DINER!    365 days, done and gone.  One year ago today, at 7:49am, the words, "Testing, testing. Is this thing on?" echoed across the internet and information super highway.  Since then, people's lives have changed, the borders of countries redrawn, the earth tilts differently and the universe is just a little more askew than it was a million years ago.  So a year ago,   Kyle  showed me this little website called   Blogger .  And of course, being that I need to have the same toys as all my friends, I started this, the Napkin Notes at the Empire Diner.  The name itself was derived from the Billy Joel song, "The Great Wall Of China."  The lyric goes, "Help yourself, it's all you can eat at the Empire Diner tonight..."  Plus I have some odd obsession with old 50s and 60s diners.  So now that I've said that little factoid that no one cares about, we'll move on.  I copied my entire blog, every single entry into Microsoft Word (not by hand of course, I copied and pasted).  In a year, I've posted roughly 87,000 words, which for some reason seems low because I talk so damn much about nothing.  I went through a list of words I though I commonly used and counted them up...   Biblical figures:    Jesus  (25), God (71, you can't link God)  Choice words [parental advisory here]:    Damn  (82),   Crap  (48),   Ass  (228),   Shi t (51),   Fuck  (21, wow, I'm beaming with pride about that one),   Hell  (41)  Friends:    Stick Bus  (83),   Kyle  (244, that's sad),   Bruen  (108),   Jeff  (124),   Sarah  (58),   Connie  (104),   Mark  (27),   Alison  (21)  Famous People:    Al Gore  (2),   Ichiro  (22)  Places:    Chicago  (61),   Illinois  (22),   Los Angeles  (32),   California  (22),   Barney's Beanery  (12),   Columbia College  (15) And this is where I am today, one year later.  Many things have changed in my life, most for the better.  And trust me, the next 365 days are going to get interesting.  Pretty much the last year has been other people's lives shifing around mine.  This year, is my turn.  I'm sure my site will fall prey to slow times and be plagued by "  hiatus " graphics, but behind the scenes I'll still be at it and trying to win whatever battle comes next.  Here's to the diner and the next revolution...    ...We'll begin with a spin, trav'ling in the world of my creation, what we'll see will defy, explanation...
