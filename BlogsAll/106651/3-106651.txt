It's been 12 hours since my last BLOG, so I have PLENTY to say.  We'll begin, with a spin in the world of my creation.  Where do I start?  I could complain about my day again and the lengths I go through to get educated.  After this I think Columbia owes me a gallery or at least a theater complex.  I'm not too sure, but this may be pride I'm feeling.  In the last year I have managed to flip my college career completely around and start heading back toward the bright light.  The only thing that beats away at my head about this is that I'll be there another three years.  Three years isn't bad, but when I look at the last six years of my life and tag on the next three, I've wasted so much time exploring my ass with my head.  I know that there is nothing I can do now except push myself hard to get through these next few years.  Ooo-ya Masterchief!  Chicago used to be my Camelot.  It was this massive castle tucked far away from this suburban dead end.  I used to love Chicago and walk around in it like a six year old on Christmas morning.  So many buildings, so many streets, so many people.  And I wanted to be its king.  Now that I go to Chicago four days a week for school, my Camelot no longer seems to be an escape in the heavens, it's just another place on a map where people bump and hurry all day.  For the first time ever I can stand in Chicago and tell you which way north is, I never knew anything about the town, that's what Jeff was for.  Everything is so different when I was given a key to the door.  Since school began, the Sears Tower has become "just another building" to me.  Until tonight that is.  Right now, it's still just warm enough for the snow to melt before it hits the ground downtown, which is a rarity in late Chicago Novembers so I won't complain about it.  Anyway, the streets and sidewalks we covered with water and glistening from a passing cab or office window.  At 9:30 at night in Chicago, things become as quiet as a city can be.   A few people, a few cars.  Looking around on my long walk to Union Station, that feeling came back to me.  It wasn't the fact that I disliked Chicago, it's just my view of her grandness was distracted with people and tourists and those damn people who walk REAL slow and right next to each other so no one can get by (get off the damn shed!).  I remember nights when we would just drive until we found that city and walk about her while a summer breeze dodged around the buildings.  Sigh...not really sure where I was going with that, just needed to BLOG.  I had a conference with Tom my English Comp 1 teacher.  I finally found an English teacher I respect and wants to show his students how to write and how to use their brains.  On top of that, the man knows good music.  Kudos to Tom.  I introduced him to this little Stick Bus world we have, hopefully he'll be a repeat viewer.  And if he is and reads this, I did figure out how to make   links  from a BLOG.  December 22nd, 2000.  That date is the first day since Kyle and Sarah went off and got all married that the four remaining Stick Bus members will be together again.  Honestly, that damn day can't come quick enough.  Fancy dinner out, drinks at the Hancock, stay at a nice hotel, a day of fun afterward.  It's what we were meant to do.  I hate the fact that we can't be together like we used to, we all had to venture off the path I guess and live our own lives, but that doesn't mean I have to like this.  We've all come so far in our lives and made major changes, this last year has been nuts.  Kyle and Sarah getting hitched and running for the coast.  Jeff finishing school and becoming an architect and mad Chicago player.  Bruen making a HUGE decision (which I will stand by) and finishing his school because he knows when that's done he can get on with his destiny, and he found himself a girl who makes him twice the guy he usually is (don't deny it).  And then there's yo.  I've been fighting forever, or so it feels like it.  My life is the best it has ever been, I'm doing well in school and I've fallen in love with someone who just makes the small things mean everything.  I told Kyle I have a two year plan.  By the year 2002, the rest of our lives will start falling in order and I promise we'll be walking on that same path again.  I need the Beanery, I need the 405, I need my friends together.  Perhaps such a public forum like this isn't the best place to say things like what I'm about to, but I'm on a roll.  6 months ago, a girl came into my life that I nearly dismissed from it all together.  She has been incredible and patient and strong with me from the get go and I want to thank her again and again for what she has done.  She patched a hole in me and woke me up to what life is like when you don't hate breathing everyday.  To some, 6 months may not seem like any epic milestone, but to me it is because for 6 months someone has defined me.  Someone has tolerated me in sobriety and stupidity.  Someone has made me feel like I was more than just another space holder.  Sometimes I wonder if she knows how awesome she is and I wonder who the fools were before that took this angel for granted.  To the angel, I say what I've said before; I can't be sure where this ride is going, but I promise we'll have fun and take it to the end.  We'll just go cruisin'.  I love you Conners.  I think that's all I have to say right now, I apologize for missing words, poor grammar and any misspelled words.  I told you it was going to be one hell of a BLOG.  We here in the Stick Bus tribe used to call things like that "Sliozis Rants" but now, I'll have to come up with a more clever title.  Well, looks like it's about my bed time.  Goodnight my friends, my girl, my family, my audience...                 "i want to be a lion.  i know, i know,                 everybody wants to pass as cats.                 we all want to be big big stars,                 but then we get second thoughts about that.                 so believe in me,  i don't believe in anything,                and i dont want to be someone to believe.                 you should not believe in me ."                 - Mr. Jones (Live VH1 Storytellers)
