Tomorrow, we're going to try something different.  Since my webcam continually pisses me off because I can never get a static IP address, I'm going to have it on all day.  Now, many of you know "The Kitchen" is located in my room and I have a dial-up connection there.  This may lead you to ask two questions...   1)  If the webcam is in your room, and you go to work, why would we want to see your empty bedroom all day?   2)  Since you have a dial-up connection, won't it be expensive to leave your webcam on all day?  Now I'm sure many of you are more concerned about question number one than number two, but regardless here is the answer to both questions...  Tomorrow, Feburary 1st, 2001...the webcam will attempt to go live from within the confines of my place of business.  Now I'm SURE that if anyone every finds out I brought a LIVE webcam into this office I'd be fired on the spot seeing as though big corporations don't really like the idea that anyone can see inside.  Strangely, I don't care.  My boss is gone until next week so there's no one here to bust me on it.  The cam will be live if everything goes according to plan by 9:00 CST tomorrow 02/01/01.  I will blog the results tomorrow morning telling you if I am good to go or aborting the mission...  Until then Cyber Cadets!
