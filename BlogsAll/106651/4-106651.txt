I woke up at 9 today.  That's late for me, I usually sleep until 7:30, 8 at the latest.  I'm slowly picking up Connie's habit of sleeping until noon.  Anyway, I HATE Wednesdays.  H A T E them.  Wednesdays just take forever, I have class at two o'clock in Chicago but there's an hour train ride before that.  I leave my house at 11:30 a.m., twenty minute walk to the train station to catch a noon train that gets me to Chicago by one.  From there it's another twenty minute walk to campus (depending on how stupid people are walking downtown, I hate tourists).  Class from two o'clock until four o'clock, then comes the suffering.  I have a two and a half hour break between the end of my first class until my next.  I can't go home, not enough time.  I don't know anyone downtown well enough to try to crash at their place either.  So I go hide in a random hallway on the fifth floor of a campus building where no one goes except the occasional janitor.  For the next two hours, I just read.  Then my second class goes from 6:30 p.m. at night until 9:30 p.m., add another hour back on the train and poof, I'm not home until 10:45 p.m., that just SUCKS.  Semester is almost over though, I should be early registering this week or early next, hopefully it will go better than it did last time.  I need to go find some crackers to eat for breakfast...
