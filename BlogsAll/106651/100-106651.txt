To our dearest neighbor, Roadface:  A few years ago, I was living at home. In this home, I had a brother. My brother and I have always led very different lives and this led to many battles about how my lovely brother really had no respect for the people around him and could care less that he was bothering me with his loud music late at night and screaming alarm early in the morning.  I clearly remember thinking, "I can't wait until I move out because people don't act like this in the real world..."  Well, I'm an idiot.  You, Roadface, have single handedly taken my hopes and smashed them into millions and millions of really sad pieces. You slam your door every time you go in or out of it. You're home all day and yet you start laundry right as the rest of us, who work for a living, are arriving home. You play your horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE music (Michael Bolton, Enrique Iglesias, Paula Cole, etc.) to an almost embarrassing level. You leave all the security gates open and the laundry door allowing anyone to just come and go. You have "relations" with your male friend...in your living room...with the patio door open...so we can all get ill at once imagining what's going on over there.  And to top it off, you left your "unmentionables" in the dryer when it was my turn to use it and I had to touch your stuff to put mine in.  Just...nasty.  Sincerely,  Dave and Connie
