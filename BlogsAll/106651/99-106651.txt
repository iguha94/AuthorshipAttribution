Roadface,  I wrote my last letter to you on   Thursday night  about how you're basically rude and disgusting. I just wanted to add  total moron  to that list.  YOUR LAUNDRY IS STILL ON TOP OF DRYER FROM THURSDAY NIGHT, YOU FREAK!  Good LORD.  - Dave   [THE WORST UPDATE EVER - 9:32 AM:  I stepped out my front door and Roadface is sitting at her dining room table (which is inexplicably next to her front door), and though her door I heard her say on the phone, "Michael, I had [relations] with him last night."  One of these days I'm just going to cry out, "I CAN HEAR YOU!"  She also FINALLY got her laundry and proceeded to leave both the laundry room door open and the security gate which would allow just any passer-by to come steal all our clothes that are in the wash. I'm SO calling the landlord Monday.  Ugh. I'm buying a house. ]    [PISSED OFF UPDATE - 12:58 PM:  So I go to get my last load out of the dryer and my wet towels are sitting miserably in my basket. Roadface took it upon herself to take my towels out of the washer so she could start laundry. It's still going to be another hour before they're done. And of course, she left all the damn doors and gates open!  Mom, Dad...if you're looking for me, I've been arrested for assult. ]
