GUTTERS    it's two in the morning again,  nothing but the whispers of tires and pavement  humming away in the background  train tracks colliding on rails counting down somewhere   everything smells wet  i guess it rained while we were asleep  the mud is still on my truck though  and you're tangled in bed sheets against the wall   i can't figure out what you were trying to say last night  you were fighting monsters in your sleep i think  they probably sounded like rain and thunder  maybe they sounded a little like me   at quarter to three the storming began again the lightning is leaving trails around the front yard and it's thrashing around the tree tops in back you don't seem to mind, hands held close to your face  i lit our one candle to see between the lightning i'm sure the rain is getting into my basement now but all i can think about is your tiny hands and the feeling of your crazy kiss and smile  just passed four now and i can't help but touch your hand warm little fingers wrap around my wrist and the pull my hand closer to your face you press your cheek against the palm of my hand  before the sun came up i gave into sleep our bed is floating on rain water and the room is a mess the rain stopped not to long ago but it's too late to worry this is just the way things were supposed to be
