...and I hate them even more when they're in movie theaters.  We just went to go see Spider-Man 2, and I know, it's opening night. That was our first mistake.  The Buckle was super psyched to see the movie, so I said, "Sure, why not?" Now, I've given up the practice of going to opening weekends a long time ago because that's when all the stupid assholes who think it's funny to hoot and holler and talk decide to go.  And sure enough, even though I silently hoped and prayed that the price of $11.00 a ticket would somehow magically keep said-assholes out of my theater...it wasn't to be. Of course there was this jackass who thought it was funny to yell, "WOOOO!" every time Spider-Man did something spiderish, and his douche-troop of merry idiots laughed everytime.  So tonight, I propose a new idea. Forget getting the theater to give you your money back, it's not their fault. From now on, I'm going to find a way to sue all these assholes for my eleven bucks. This also goes for constant talkers, loud children, cell phones, and people who bring babies to loud movies. Oh, and anyone from the age of fourteen to eighteen who don't have a job or aren't accompanied by parents.  And while we're talking about things that I hate, let me mention the worst ad campaign EVER, the   Fantanas .  Go ahead,   Sarah , what are your thoughts?
