Time for ice skating pictures!  - At the time this picture was taken, I swear I heard a man turn to his wife and say, "Honey, go lock up our daughters, these   BOYS  look like trouble."  - Here we see   JEFF CRAIN  making an attempt to win the title of "Sexiest Ice Hunk."  This pose was very nice but sadly the judges were distracted by the horrible pants of the girl.   NOTE:   To girl with ugly pants - if somehow you come across this, please e-mail me, I will be more than happy to lend you money to buy pants that don't suck.  - Amazingly, the title of "Sexiest Ice Bunny" was a draw.  It was shared by these two   LADIES .  - The battle in the men's competition began to get intense.  Here,   JEFF E. AND DAVE  try to come up with a plan to eliminate Jeff C. from the running.  -   JEFF E.  puts his plan into action, looks good so far.  OH!  Then disaster strikes!  Witnesses say seeing   THIS  was like watching a semi-truck hit a Geo Metro.  Just gruesome.  - Well, this is my webpage and my pseudo-story so I get to win...and I get to take an   ICE BUNNY  home with me too...  S w e e e e t . . .
