BLOG TIP #4:  Quit being STUPID! Again, with the subject of being stupid in a blog, I'll admit I was an offender.  But I have VERY little tolerance for stupid people (ask my brother) and have changed my ways.  Being stupid is funny at times, but when you're stupid too much, it makes your blog frustrating to read.  I've actually stopped "subscribing" to blogs because for every GOOD post they had, there were at least FOUR on some infantile babble (I REALLY want to point fingers here but I know that just makes for bad blood).  I've read another blog where by all means the author had the potential to be very intelligent and write some very good blogs, but they sacrificed themselves to talking about things that were just...STUPID.  Stupid blogs don't even have to be generated in monologue format.  You can be writing a blog about a conversation you've had with friends, read it!  You might find out you have stupid friends!  But yes, you writing the stupid things your stupid friends said, DOES qualify as a stupid blog.  Just think about what you're writing.  If you stop a second and ask yourself, "Is this stupid?" you might save yourself some public embarrassment.  Even go back and read your blog again.  You might find something out about yourself.    I also understand that many people, possibly even yourself, are just stupid.  I have no advice for you there.  Sorry.   Next Lesson:  Make it look smooooooth...
