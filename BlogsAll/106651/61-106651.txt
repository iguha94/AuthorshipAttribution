IN SEARCH OF...WHAT?   I know it's another cliched thing to do with blogger, but I still want to list some of the things that people have been searching for and somehow my site is coming up for them.  Some of them are understandable, others are just odd.  I think I'm going to add another box to the right here for the best search query line of the week.  Anyway, here are some of the more recent ones.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Empire Diner  - Which of course makes sense.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wilco lyrics  - This is also okay, they are one of my favorite &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bands and I do have their lyrics plastered all over this site.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Popper skinny  - A little rare, but I did do a short blog &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about that.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gizmo Duck  - Damn right, Gizmo Duck.  I'd hope this comes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up in everyone's search queries.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hashbrowns  - Hmm...okay...?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we both lie silently still  - At first I had no idea why this was in there, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then I searched my blog.  Those are the first lyrics to "Every Rose &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has it's Thorn" by Poison.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stupid company names  - I  REALLY  hope that wasn't referring &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the name   Stick Bus .  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pictures of hashbrowns  - ...what the hell?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comodores lyrics  - I don't even listen to the Comodores.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blairwich  - Ouch, that was a punch in the stomach.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poje skating  -   Poje  doesn't skate, he designs.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dave's Willams web page  - No, no.  Dave SLIOZIS, that's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not even CLOSE to Williams.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aki from Final Fantasy getting f**ked  - Okay, no.  And &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there's something depressing to be said about people searching &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for computer generate characters in sexual positions.  Loser.  With my luck, this only opened the door for more odd things to appear in my seach query.  I expect that Final Fantasy line to pop-up a lot more now.
