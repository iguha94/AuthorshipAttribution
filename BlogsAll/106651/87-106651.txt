E. HONDA, SUMO: ANSWERS THE FRIDAY FIVE         1. What is your current occupation? Is this what you chose to be doing at this point in your life? Why or why not?    My current occupation is "World's Strongest Sumo Wrestler." You can look it up. On the side I travel the globe competing in the Street Fighting contest in order to prove I am not only the strongest sumo, but the strongest fighter on the planet! [ E. Honda raises his massive arms in a show of triumph ] Is this what I chose to be doing? Yes, I guess it is. I mean I'm happy being a sumo wrestler and competing. The lifestyle is great, women, money and all the food I can get down. And really, what else is there for a sumo to do? I mean can you imagine me working at The GAP?    2. If time/talent/money were no object, what would your dream occupation be?    Hmm, that's a good question. If time/talent/money were no object to me, I think I'd like to follow in the footsteps of that Lance Bass fellow [ E. Honda points his thumbs in some kind of dance ] and become an astronaut. Of course a guy like me would need to slim down quite a bit first, eh? Perhaps I'd even start the first sumo training camp on the moon. How great would that be? Without gravity, everyone could experience the rush of doing one of my famous "sumo headbutts!"    3. What did/do your parents do for a living? Has this had any influence on your career choices?    My father was once a famous chef all across China and my mother was a waitress. During my father's traveling cooking show, they stopped into a restaurant for their demonstration. My father said, "A clumsy and beautiful waitress came crashing through the kitchen door spilling rice and teriyaki all over. Our eyes met, and the rest is history." My father is a wonderful cook and while I was growing up he had made me his official taste tester, [ E. Honda pats his belly and roars ] that would explain a few things, eh! WAHAHAHA! Anyway, my grandfather on my dad's side was actually once a great sumo wrestler, so all the plans were there for me to become the "World's Strongest Sumo Wrestler."    4. Have you ever had to choose between having a career and having a family?    Oh yes, many times. I have to travel often for not only the sumo wrestling circuit but also to compete in the Street Fighting arenas. I can be gone for weeks at a time [ E. Honda shakes his head ]. But my family understands. They understand that it's my job to compete and one day they know that I will retire and be home with them. Plus the kids don't seem to complain every time I buy them a new Digimon toy! [ E. Honda roars again ] WAHAHA! You know what I'm saying! HAHAA!    5. In your opinion, what is the easiest job in the world? What is the hardest? Why?    Wow, this is a very difficult question because even the simplest job has many difficulties. Even the origami folder gets many paper cuts. Now, if I were a sumo looking for another job, the hardest might be something like an airline steward. Those small aisles are a tight fight for me! Also being the leader of a country would be very hard. A sumo takes many knocks to the head during his career and the president must make great decisions that must be unclouded. The easiest job for a sumo? That's easy, official taste tester! [ E. Honda lets loose one more massive laughing that shakes the room ] HAAAHAAAHAA! DOOF-OY!     Friday Five  inspired by   The PJZ .
