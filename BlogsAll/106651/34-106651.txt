"He's got one extraordinary chance at the dream of a lifetime.  Alex Rogan is a small-town teenager with big-time dreams.  He's just like everyone else, except Alex has a very special talent...  Tonight, a mysterious stranger will call on Alex.  He comes from a galaxy that's under attack by an alien force.  And Alex's unique ability is their last hope..."   This could be one of the best sites EVER, not for style but for content.  It's   THE LAST STARFIGHTER  homepage.  Now there are some people who will remain unnamed (  CONNIE ) who have never seen the movie and refuse to, while there are people like   KYLE  and I who will tell you how awesome this film is (forget Kyle likes "Captain Ron" for credibility issues).  Anyway, this site even has (Kyle...you sitting down?) "The Last Starfigter" game that game out on the Atari WAY back when.  All you need is the emulator and you can help Grig save the universe!   Centauri:  Alex! Alex! You're walking away from history! History, Alex! Did Chris Columbus stay home? Nooooo. What if the Wright Brothers thought that only birds should fly? And did Galupa think that the Ulus were too ugly to save?  Alex Rogan:  Who's Galupa?  Centauri:  Never mind.  Alex Rogan:  Listen, Centauri. I'm not any of those guys, I'm a kid from a trailer park.  Centauri:  If that's what you think, then that's all you'll ever be!
