BLOG TIP #5:  Make it look smooooooth... Back in action, time to release formatting fear back into the blog community.  And take note, I might just be talking about YOU...  Now when I say "make it look smooth" I'm talking about two things.  Text format and the look of your overall site.  With many sites, I notice that there is a flow problem when I read the text.  The spacing is wrong or lines cut off like the enter key was pressed mid-sentence.  This makes for obnoxious reading.  Blogger text wraps to the window size automatically.  Please, only press the enter key when making a new paragraph (for those of you who even understand HOW to do a paragraph).  Making your site look smooth is an easy thing to do.  If you don't know anything about web design, fear not.    BLOGGER  offers 4 ready-to-go blog formats so you don't have to catch up on twenty years of web technology (you stupid ape).  While they may be boring templates, they'll do the job.  There is nothing worse than finding a blog which has graphics and terrible colors strewn about so you don't know where to go.  It may look cool...but pisses me off.  Your reader shouldn't feel attacked by your design.  And once again, just because your friends say it's cool, doesn't mean it is.  Your friends could be tasteless-dumbasses like yourself.  That's the lesson for today.  Image is everything.   Next Lesson:   For Christ's sakeproofread!
