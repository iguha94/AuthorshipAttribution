FRUSTRATION AND THE BIG MAROON MACHINE   Last night, my dad and I drove an hour and a half to Rockford to look into buying a new   car .  Well...it was a DISMAL failure.  The dealer was a nice guy and all, but I've pretty much screwed myself with the Big Maroon Machine.  I still owe $10,535.80 on the Mountaineer, but the dealership was only able to give me $7500 on the trade in.  So the $3000 difference would be added to the $20,000 price tag on the new car.  Plus, I have no down payment (well, I do, but $100 isn't going to do much).  After some calculations, the dealer said I'd be paying about $460 a month (that's IMPOSSIBLE when you work 18hrs. a week) and the dealer suggested that I try to sell the car myself and aim for $10,000.  That killed me.  Like someone kicked me in the face.  It wasn't his fault so I wasn't mad at him, I was mad at the situation I've now been put in.  And of course, now this morning, the Big Maroon Machine had a REALLY hard time starting up.  Great.  With all this, I'm frustrated, I'm pissed off and just confused.  I was really hoping just to do this and move on.  And I know   Connie  will be mad that I'm going to say this again, but if I had done what I was supposed to do (go to school) and finish when I was supposed to, then I might have had a full time job by now and been able to afford that.  Ugh.  Now I just have to try and not be a spoiled little kid and probably sacrifice my pride for "something that just gets me from A to B."  Damnit.
