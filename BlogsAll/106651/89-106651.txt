IT'S A LAZY OLD FISHERMAN DAY       So I'm 24 now. Doesn't feel much different. Still broke, still mildly annoyed with my job, still hate my car, still living at home.   Bruen  reminded me this morning I'm supposed to die at 25. Thanks for that Bru. The birthday was delightfully uneventful. I managed to avoid the office party radar and just have a nice quiet day. I won't reveal what I got for my birthday because it might do some permanent damage to my   Hot or Not  score. Regardless, I am still thankful for the gifts, the cards, the well wishing, and the people who understood that I just like a quiet birthday.  I need some new photos because I know you're all starting to think I like looking at myself over there.  I placed second in   The Frankenberry Monologues  first annual (biannual? weekly? I don't know how often)   haiku  contest with this whizzer:    "strong and silky legs  with a voluptuous chest  how i love your dad"   Nice, eh? Next time, I'll take that first place title.   Leaf  is the   Apollo Creed  to my   Rocky ...  NOTE TO   ALISON : My   Great American Baseball Count  needs to be updated to 9 to tie with   Rehmer . However you may wait because I'm going to   Cubs  vs.   Astros  tomorrow to watch the 30 million-dollar-man suck it up again (for you non-baseball-ites, that would be   this  overpriced outfield decoration).  I could rant about nothing for days.
