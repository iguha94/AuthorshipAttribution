This one goes out to a pretty little girl out there who stole my heart with those   blue   eyes of hers.  These are words for her to hear and words for her to know and if ever a song that will define what we are for each other, it will be this one.   Have a Little Faith In Me   by John Hiatt    When the road gets dark  And you can no longer see  Just let my love throw a spark  And have a little faith in me     And when the tears you cry  Are all you can believe  Just give these loving arms a try  And have a little faith in me  And     Have a little faith in me     When your secret heart  Cannot speak so easily  Come here darlin'  From a whisper start  To have a little faith in me     And when your back's against the wall  Just turn around and you will see  I will catch, I will catch your fall baby  Just have a little faith in me     Well, I've been loving you for such a long time girl  Expecting nothing in return  Just for you to have a little faith in me  You see time, time is our friend  'Cause for us there is no end  And all you gotta do is have a little faith in me  I said I will hold you up, i will hold you up  Your love gives me strength enough  So have a little faith in me    ...goodnight baby...
