DAVE vs. COLLEGE   The war rages on.  Today I re-enrolled in the community college I hated so much because things at Columbia weren't working out.  Columbia really screwed me over and I'm thinking about writing a letter to tell them how awful their entire set up is and how impossible it is for students to get anything they need.  Columbia always said, "Our teachers are also currently working in the field."  Well that's nice and everything because they have a ton of life experience, but I always had the feeling they never gave their all because they knew that in a few years we'd be competing with them for jobs out there.  Jerks.  Anyway, I'm nervous about going back to the community college because I thought I was done there and I thought my life was finally moving forward.  I'm nervous about going back because I'm smarter than that place and I hate having to use it as a stepping stone.  I'm starting to feel like leaving Columbia was a dumb thing to do, and now I've got to go face my old enemy again.  I'm much older and I guess much wiser than I was the first time around so maybe it won't be so bad.  I don't know, my life seems to be shifting in big ways again and the twisting in my stomach isn't getting any better.  We'll see in two weeks.    Jeff Crain  offered me some advice on the subject:   "Every school is a shit-hole man, it's like they're the giant toilets of our lives, and they flush years and years away.  And when it comes down to it, the only thing that is any different is what color the lid is."
