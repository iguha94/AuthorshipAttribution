Okay, I'm going to come right out and say that I am pretty much dreading this evening.  Why you ask?  Let me tell you why...  I've been going out with Connie for about 7+ months.  Within those 7 months I have heard countless stories about her father.  Mind you, none of these stories were along the lines of "likes to hug" or "very positive thinking."  No, no.  Many of them have only instilled an unexplainable fear of inadequacy in me.  Many of you will recall that in the beginning of my relationship, I was admittedly afraid of Connie's brother Dan.  I later got over that fear and Dan rocks.  But this is different.  Can a boy EVER be good enough for daddy's little girl?  Especially when he's a nerd majoring in film production who can hardly lift his own body weight?  Uh...probably not.  I just really have no idea what to do.  I WILL lapse into a coma probably minutes before entering the restaurant.  Of course, it probably won't be that bad.  I'm just afraid of saying the wrong thing or using the wrong fork.  I won't be me.  I'll be formulating every response in my head before it comes out.  Crap...Connie doesn't even think he knows how old I am.  That should be a comfortable topic if it comes up.  "So son, how old are you?" "I'm 22 sir." "Oh I see...into cradle robbing are you?  Are you buying my little girl booze?  Couldn't you find someone your own age?  SON!  I WILL BREAK YOU!"  Ugh.  Mental note, bring change of pants for when I piss myself in fear.
