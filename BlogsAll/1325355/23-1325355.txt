         I walked into the shabby temp agency offices at 32nd and Madison and met Joe, a fast talking brown haired man with hard eyes. He said he could definitely get me a job as an admin doing power point presentations for an investment firm making more money and better benefits.  I said where do I sign and by the way I'm 2 months pregnant.  He quickly changed his tune at the news.  Well, I can't help you, then. Who's going to want to hire you knowing you're going to go on maternity leave in several months?  He sounded almost angry with me.  I left that small little man in his shabby little office and didn't look back, resting my hand on my belly on the ride home, knowing that I can endure anything, any rejection, any hardship so long as I have my baby -- any job seems so measly by comparison ... and so I find myself not as upset as I thought I would be -- having a baby inside of me sort of puts the world around me into perspective.  And taking care of plants isn't so bad -- at least here I'm surrounded by people who have grown to love and care for me over the past 3 years .. I know they will be happy for me when I tell them about my little hidden virgo treasure.. and maybe this is the sort of place I belong in right now, rather than a strange new environment with a boss that would just resent me in his small-minded way ... for what?? creating life?? how ridiculous and sad.
