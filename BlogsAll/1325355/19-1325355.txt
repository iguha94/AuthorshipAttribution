         hello ladies,  As some of you may know, in less than 7 weeks I'll be starting my clinical rotations! I am so excited and really scared at the same time. Each of us in our class were given "wish lists" in addition to trying to set up rotations in our home states(background: we have to have rotations in several states). So far, I am applying for MD Anderson for oncology, and have a cardiology rotation setup in Houston otherwise thats it for my Texas tour as it stands right now. Its really a mystery as to where "they" ultimately decide to send me. Its frustrating in a sense, because they say we have all these options & opportunities yet when we choose places we're interested in they send us elsewhere. I am trying to go with the flow. The motto is: everything floats on water and therefore are schedules can change at anytime. Well, to get to the point "they" want to send me to China for a month!    I think the traveling & medical experience would be so cool...but I'm nervous that I'm not cut out for this adventure. Since my Africa trip I'm a little more apprehensive of traveling to distant places alone where I know nothing of the area etc. I do not regret my Africa trip, it was an experience of a lifetime but I do wonder if things didn't turn out the way they did if I'd still think so. I guess its all about risks and one's outlook on life?   So, I just got off the phone with my sweetie and he suggests I think it over. I always thought it be cool if we went together on our own someday. The other aspect is money. In addition to our regular semester tuition, we also have to pay all of our own expenses and living throughout this coming year. Mucho dinero! What are your opinions? I can protest if I don't want to go but I only have a short time frame to respond & then its out of my hands.  Go. Not go. Maybe later. Ask again?   Goodnight from the NW
