Hello all! I was waiting for my breakfast taquito when this came on! I had to smily warmly with visions of yesterday in my head.  MONDAY, 23 JUNE 2003 From   The Writer's Almanac   Poem: "Why I Take Good Care of my Macintosh," by   Gary Snyder  (used by permission of the poet).  Why I Take Good Care of my Macintosh  Because it broods under its hood like a perched falcon, Because it jumps like a skittish horse     and sometimes throws me Because it is poky when cold Because plastic is a sad, strong material     that is charming to rodents Because it is flighty  Because my mind flies into it through my fingers Because it leaps forward and backward,     is an endless sniffer and searcher, Because its keys click like hail on a boulder And it winks when it goes out,  And puts word-heaps in hoards for me,     dozens of pockets of      gold under boulders in streambeds, identical seedpods     strong on a vine, or it stores bins of bolts; And I lose them and find them,  Because whole worlds of writing can be boldly layed out     and then highlighted and vanish in a flash     at "delete"     so it teaches     of impermanence and pain; And because my computer and me are both brief     in this world, both foolish, and we have earthly fates, Because I have let it move in with me     right inside the tent And it goes with me out every morning We fill up our baskets,       get back home, Feel rich,      relax,      I throw it a scrap and it hums.
