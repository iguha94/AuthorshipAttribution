         i ate everything didn't deny myself a thing i tipped the scale at 200 on my 8th month triumphantly gaining over 60 pounds during my pregnancy i am now happily a size 8 again only thing left to show for it are some silky silvery tiger stripes up and down my little belly and my beautiful angelic baby the pride of my life  amber here are some ugly truths your butt is going to get huge your hips are going to get wide your belly is going to get big and depending on your mom you may or may not get stretch marks you will gain lots of weight your nose is going to get wide (if it's a boy) and your feet are going to swell your boobs will become someone else's literally and will never be the same again  but don't sweat it enjoy it eat everything you want but just keep in mind don't eat as if you're eating for two because unless you really need it and one hamburger isn't enough and the only thing that will satisfy you is a 24 oz steak with potatoes for the most part one serving is good enough  anyway after the baby comes into the world you have plenty of time to get back to where you were before and you can look just as hot and sexy then as you look now so don't worry about it  and i know you you won't have a problem putting in all the yummy nutritious things you need drink lots of milk baby will take away as much calcium from you as he/she can eat fruit every day even if it's only an apple and stay away from whatever makes you nauseous  speaking of nauseous i didn't have any symptoms except when i took my prenatals first thing in the morning i think it's the iron in it??? i don't know something made me nauseous about it so i switched i started taking them at night just before bed and everything was just fine  do you think it could be something like that for you???
