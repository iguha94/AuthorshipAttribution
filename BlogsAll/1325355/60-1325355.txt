...but why am I awake at 2:30 morning on a sunday/monday morning, posting this?  Well, its cause Dave and I just got back from   Kollective Fusion's  first gallery show.    The show was held in the upstairs of a building down on 6th street...a nice space all lit up good...a DJ spinning, free drinks and  people dancing .    It turns out that Kollective Fusion is made up of a couple of Austin designer's and artists, one of whom is Stephen ?, a fella that Colin and I played ball with back at SWT.  His stuff was pretty tight- the stuff I like the most were promo posters he had done and framed, including one for a   Jurassic 5  show last year.  Anyhow, I had brought my camera with the idea that I would take some fotos of stuff to blog about later...but Dave had other ideas...and soon I was taking pictures of him and various of the fine and beautifuls.  The gallery show ended at 10 and the after-party started up down the street at a place called 419 West (actually on 4th street).  A jazz-a-billy band played some music and then a DJ started spinning and some folks even got up all freestyle which sounded pretty good...  I had a good time listening to the music and watching people be what I am not, and Dave had good time talking with the lovelies....
