         Carol is trying to ask for maru (after a lot of wine) how to plant a cactus gardens?  I have a very shaded back yard and would like to start a cactus garden in the corner.  In other words do I have to buy special dirt and have it raised?  Our dirt is very dry and clay like.  Do I need special dirt or something else to facilitate a cactus garden?  What do you suggest?  I also have a lot of shade in the front yard (four trees).  What plants  do you suggest for a variety of color? Please tell me specific plants, not names of books to research.  I don't have the time.  I would really appreciate your knowledge on this. I hope you can help me.    I hope you have your baby naturally.  I had a great experience and I believe it was the pre-natal yoga that helped me. I had Ezra within 2 1/2 hrs with no drugs, and it was the best experience of my life and I'm not afraid of doing it again.  I mention this because I think it's an option to really look in to.  PLUS, you probably already know, there are post-natal yoga classes out there for you to take advatnage of.  I was interested in starting a vegetable garden in the one sunny spot I have.  I understand that you need to have to have it elevated and it needs good drainage.  What do you suggest for good drainage?    OK  sounds good...and I don't have a flat roof.
