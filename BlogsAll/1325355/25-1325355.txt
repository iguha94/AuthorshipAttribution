         For some reason or another, I have developed a reputation of being a prankster here in my office group of 15.  I don't know where these ideas come from, but a result of this is that I am now the target of innovative acts.  On Monday of this week, I stayed home with Killito to care for him as he got over a weekend stomach virus.  When I came back to the office on Tuesday, I couldn't find my stapler.  It has great emotional value to me because my ex-boss gave it to me when I left my last job.  Plus, it matches the desk he gave my husband. SO Here I am Tuesday morning asking the entire group at the top of my voice over the cubicle walls if they had my stapler.  No one responded.  As it turned out, I had missplaced it , then I found it later that day. SO Wednesday was Admin Asst day.  My boss took me to lunch with the other admins and we had a blast.  When I got back to the office, I found an email in my inbox from one called,  Stanley Stapler .  I didn't open the email right away because I thought it could be a virus.  So I ignored it for a while.  About an hour later, I couldn't find my stapler.  So I looked all over the floor thinking I missplaced it again and then it occured to me to check the evil email. I did. And this is what I found  -----Original Message----- From: Stanley Stapler [mailto:mrstanleystapler@hotmail.com]  Sent: Wednesday, March 17, 2004 2:23 PM To: Chavez, Carolina Subject: Lunch   How was your lunch today??
