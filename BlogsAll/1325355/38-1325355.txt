         Carol,  Here are some shade loving plants for hot climates -- I'd like to help you more, but I need more information about your garden first.  Next time you have a free weekend, take a look at the sun/shade patterns in your yard and the compass directions (south tends to be sunniest/warmest, north tends to be darkest/coolest)  Caladiums - look for beautiful white, pink, and red leaf striations.  These look like small, colorful elephant ears Elephant Ears - large, tropical leaves in upright arrow-shaped forms or downward facing, relaxed forms Begonias - good flowering plants for shade, come in lots of different colors -- yellow, orange, red, white -- look for more beautiful angel-wing, rex, and tuberous begonias, rather than the regular garden variety Ferns - Really brighten up a shady area with their lacy foliage -- look for the silver-leaf Japanese Painted Fern or the red-in-autumn foliage of the Autumn Fern Variegated Ginger - look for the yellow and green striped leaf -- very striking foliage Black Alocasia - looks like a black-leaved, silver-veined elephant ear -- beautiful, unusual, highly desirable Creeping Jenny - look for the golden or green-leaf versions -- nice creeping groundover, more interesting than the usuals Pygmy Date Palm - A graceful, slow-growing palm that tolerates shade -- you can buy them around 1-2' tall, and they eventually will get as big as 10-15' Ivy - old stand-by groundcover for shade.  White and gold variegated varieties are more interesting. Vinca - used mostly as a groundcover, but does also get a star-shaped blue flower -- I like the variegated form best Mondo Grass - grassy mounding grouncover also called monkey grass -- look for the dwarf black mondo for something diffferent -- a similar effect is liriope & Silver Dragon Liriope has very nice white and green striped foliage Shade Coleus - look for purple-leaf coleus varieties as these tolerate more shade.  Very colorful foliage -- one of your best bets for interesting leaf color and texture in the shade Wandering Jew - purple-leaf groundcover grows vigorously and has a pretty little lavender bloom Tradescantia - also called spiderworts, these are grassy looking perennials that get very charming little pink or purple blooms  Hope this helps!
