I finally got   MovableType  up and running on my ibook!  I want to try this blog server out because I am very interested in blogging and   moblogging , and from what I have read MovableType is pretty comphrehensive as far as features.  Also, it supports most of the Blogger XML-RPC API, and most of the metaWebLog XML-RPC API, which means it will be useful as test platform for my next project...     Warning!  Post gets boring!      I had a tough time getting Movable Type working properly because I tried to configure it to use  mysql  support.  It turned out that my perl install does not include the DBD::mysql  module, and for unknown reasons CPAN was unable to install it.  I suspect that the problem has something to do with the fact that my mysql install is located in /Library/Mysql instead of a more usual place like /usr/local, and so during the build process the Linker had hard time finding the proper header files and libraries.  I even tried to build the module manually, but every attempt to proplerly link the required object files failed, so i am now running this thing w/out db support....  And it works great!  This thing offers so much more than the free version of   blogger , which is to be suspected I guess.  What I really like is that you can add  comments  to posts.    Anyhow, I am thinking that maybe we could get this thing up and running on   chairjockey.com  and eventually transition ourselves to a full-service blog...
