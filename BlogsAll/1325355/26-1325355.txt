         i love talking about s e x i love sex when you're prego so much FULLER for both this is when the woman's body is so ready for it too so much more pleasurable you need to explain to antn'y that it is wonderful for the baby it will massage him and shoot him full of good hormones scientifical reason is your body is so PLUMPED, ENGORGED, INFLAMED and ripe for loving it's true, that's why women who suffer from nasal congestion feel it even more while pregnant, as the hormones of pregnancy can cause swelling of the nasal passages and increased mucus production. This is a good thing because thos same hormones cause swelling and plumping in other areas that can be felt in the throes of loving  tell antn'y to get over it and get on your hands and knees girl you can't hurt the baby.  unless of course your doctor tells you otherwise  I think these days six weeks might be cutting it it pretty close if you don't stay active to the end.  I mean, walk, walk and walk, do yoga and more yoga, and stay active.  Then it will be easier to get on with things. I was out and about 2 weeks after the Adolfo Fidel was born.  We took him out to eat at Empire.  But I did get very tired very quickly.  Maybe it was the c-section...  I think you may find it harder to leave your little baby behind than you think.
