Twice Since I have lived at 616 I have had to call the cops. The first time was in August. At 3 am I heard footsteps on my front porch. I get up go outside. There are three drunk white college kids sitting on my front porch. WHAT THE FUCK. I tell them that I am going to count to three and that they had better get the fuck off my porch. I made it to two and then they saw my brother and tore ass out of there. Tonight. Liz and I are watching Two Towers and then we hear screaming. not screaming in a Nosgul kind of in the distance but on my front porch front door opening screaming running through my house. Then at the door of my bedroom banging screaming doorknob turning screaming leap out of my bed stopping big fat crack whore from coming into my fucking room.
