         OK, you are right about the protein and calcium. If you don't eat enough calcium, your body will take it from the bones and that's not good. Protein, eat a little more than you usually would at each meal, that way you don't feel totally full and bloated after a meal, and eat small frequent meals. But Carolina would tell you the same thing! Lifting? Really try not to lift too much-a scientific explanation: you know when you have to burp or (pooh) and you "push," That "maneuver" causes negative pressure in your insides-which causes gas and other stuff to come out, but you don't really want to do that right now, because it can affect your womb too, maybe. Anyways, the same effect occurs when you lift heavy things too.   Yoga is great! Try prenatal yoga though, so they know what you should and shouldn't do. I personally, (and Carolina probably would too) would encourage you to TRY going pain free. When you have anaesthesia, you are more tired and groggy afterward and it's more difficult to recover from. Also, your baby may be groggy too and may not want that first, important colostrum.  BUT, most people get the epidural and are FINE, and they do great. And it's not bad to do so, but wouldn't it be great to just try and see what your body can really do? Like a marathon, it's not fun, nor easy, but the sense of accomplishment and empowerment is priceless.  These are opinions, but the yoga should help get everything "opened" up and ready for labor. When is the due date? September right? You are going to be great-listen to your doc. and don't hesitate to ask him/her alot of questions-don't worry about taking up his/her time, that's what they are there for, or ask the beautiful, wonderful nurse at your clinic!  Hope this helps! But Carol is of course the expert, you should have seen all her books!
