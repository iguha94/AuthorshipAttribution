i had a dream last night WHEW crazy nightmare many issues first -  Laura called me  from Sunny Beach a tropical place, she explained and reasoned that I should already know that since she lived in Virginia with all of you she called me to ask me so how long have you been pregnant? she had sensed it over the many miles because of a change in the wind then i discovered that Killy knew i was pregnant too but that I didn't know so i pretended i knew and laughed insincerely that I knew for weeks already THEN later that day I got fired from my waitressing job because of gossiping and as I was ready to go home a really nice asian guy one of those ultra hip super souped car jag guys parked ON TOP of my little car squashing it into the shape of a box i cried from having lost the job and felt bad for making the nice asian guy fell bad so i took my baby to a petting zoo which was the best petting zoo in the world because it had a whole slew of llamas to pet and a big yard full of kissing cows yep - that's right - cows that, instead of mooing made BIG WET kissing sounds so loud that sometimes it came out sounding like a high pitched squeak and then - these cows looked like something that dr. Seuss would draw anyway the baby and i went through the zoo and ended up at my old bosses house (Don was the baby's second godfather) where we ran into quickly upon seeing a six foot rabbit in the back yard who really wanted to get into the moon so my boss shares a trick from the 60s with us this time, it was barbara ann and the baby and me hanging out at Don's house he showed us how to take essential oils  and rub them on our gums for a REALLY stunning, natural high with no side effects (except for a dry mouth) and it was good for the baby too! SO there we were when all of a sudden the cops busted in and arrested Don and Adolph (I don't know how Adolph got in there) for being Hector Molesters hmmmm so barbara was confused and argued  ineffectively to release don and adolph but the cops wouldn't have any of it i finally got her to stop talking as i saw that this was just working against us and i let the cops do their thing but just before they left i pleaded to their common sense which i realized they totally lacked when they insisted on arresting don and adolph and they took them away and barbara ann, the baby and i were left in don's house afraid to go outside because of the six foot rabbit who kept looking at the moon  then i woke up
