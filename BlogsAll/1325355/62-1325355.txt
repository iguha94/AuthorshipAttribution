how do you feel, paul? and remember, this is for posterity so...be honest.   the suburbs may kill me, but it's a risk i'm willing to take for now. I'm trying to make the best of the situation that i'm in (put myself in?). Life at my mom's house is good. Her internal clock, which she's been operating on for years now, wakes her up at 4 a.m. She puts coffee on every morning, so i've had one every morning this week. that's nice. i've also had the pleasure of being taught all there is to know about washing clothes so they get 'clean'.  remember clean? i mean, REALLY clean. MOM CLEAN? well, it's 24/7 these days. I'm clean as a whistle. the stains i never thought would go away are gone.  we haven't had a chance to hit the parks for walks yet, but i'm looking forward to that. there is a nice bike/walking trail just down the street and a park to go with it with big soccer fields. once my weekends free themselves up i may check for pickup games.  speaking of pickup games: sorry i won't be able to make it to san antonio this weekend, colin. i wish i had the time, but i just don't. i'm so sorry. i was really hoping that you were going to be able to make it to houston and check out museums and stuff. there's always next week, i guess. maybe you can make a getaway sunday.  life here in the burbs isn't all that bad. i don't get to see adolph too often, and the drive is longer than i really want it to be, but i can deal with that for now. luckily i've gone to empire/brazil/diedrich's/chicken & eggroll/nikos/la mexicana/tapatia enough times to not need to go there so often anymore.
