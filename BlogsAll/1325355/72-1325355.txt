The Valley Report - day 2, Friday   Breakfast   A huevos rancheros plate from a small mexican restaurant. As you can imagine, this is very, very, very bad for me. It came with a sausage patty. I ate it.  We met my sister's at a small Mexican restaurant off of Closner in Edinburg. Adolfo iv decided to thorw the largest tantrum he's ever thrown. We had taken him out of his chair to walk around after we had finsihed eating. I was talking with my sister's and carol walked around the restaurant with him. He was getting a little too close to a family so she moved him. He went nuts. Totally nuts. He threw himself on the ground and screamed. I was in awe. I had never seen anything like it. Carol took him outside and i took care of the bill. He wasn't very happy getting back in his seat either.  We spent the most of the afternoon at my sister's house. Carol put the boy to sleep and my sister's and i caught up.  We had  lunch  around 3:  Fish and chips. Another dish that is going to kill me.  We checked into the echo hotel, ordered room service for the kid (grilled cheese and a fruit plate - $9.00)     We hung out in the room all night. Quietly. Lovely Quiet. So far....  They have a wireless network set up here in the lobby of the echo hotel. Sweet!
