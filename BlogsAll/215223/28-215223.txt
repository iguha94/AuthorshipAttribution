Puffy Fuffbay!  Wow, the Wonder Pup's a year old today!  That means we've been together for nine months.  Adopting him was the smartest thing I ever did...he's  literally  saved my life.  Through all of this recent mess, when I'd reached that emotional cliff, ready to clean out the medicine cabinet, I'd stop myself because I didn't want my boy to have to go back to the Humane Society, or worse.  I did, one night, think (briefly) about taking him with me, but I finally decided that was far too Egyptian and would only land us as a filler item in the   Post .  And now I've become one of those people with random dog hair on his shirts and a funny story about how the puppy sleeps on my head sometimes.  It's okay, I have love.  When he decides it's a terrific idea to stretch out on top of me and watch tv, or when he comes over in the middle of an unexplained crying jag and cocks his head at me, or, almost best yet, on our way back from the dog run or the Park and he keeps looking up at my like I'm his only hero...well, hell, roll me in dog hair, I've got love.  I also love the Big Orange Bike.  JJ and I let the river run again...besides the great exercise, you get tan, hairy daddies, tattooed alterna-skaters, straight boys in suits, Sam Champion enjoying his own weather, happy secretaries in real-flower leis, yachts with helicopters on top...Summer gooooooood.  Fire still baaaaad, though.  Even though we've already been to the dog run and Petland (for treats and a new collar), I'm surprising my boy (do I have to protect  his  anonymity, too?) by taking him on an unscheduled run in the Park before I go to see The Music Man (please, it's free) and then cocktails with JJ and some random boys at Bar Rage.
