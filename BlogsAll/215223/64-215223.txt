Triskaidekaphobia   I only have a mild case of it, but days like today tend to bring it out in folks.  Since I live on the 13th Floor in a city where elevators skip from 12 to 14, I'm just not as fazed by it anymore.  However, this morning when I woke up at 11:15am and realized I was supposed to be at work at 9am, I had a relapse.  The dog hadn't been walked or fed (and he was almost out of food), I didn't get a chance to shower or iron a shirt (thank goddess for   this stuff ...does it work around one's eyes?), and any sort of breakfast was out of the question.  Mercifully I had a stray can of Diet Coke in the fridge to start my heart.  Fuckin' Friday the 13th!  The saddest part of all is, when I strolled in at 11:45am no one noticed that I was almost three hours late.  So maybe 13 isn't so bad after all.  Or maybe it's just trying to lull me into a false sense of security so I'll relax, go out tonight and have a couple of drinks, and stumble across ex-boyfriends making out with the   Brewer Twins .  Whatever.  I'm unafraid.  Maybe I'll find the   Carlson Twins ...  I have nothing planned this weekend but eating protein bars and working out.  It worries me only because my idle brain is truly the Devil's Playground and I'm apt to get into more trouble than I should.  All the more to report here, I guess.  But never mind about me.  To   Todd :  Break a leg!  You don't need Razzle Dazzle, you've got that smile...  If you're in Cleveland, go see  Chicago , opening tonight.  To   Richard :  "Nimm meine aufrichtigen Wunsche entgegen"  Break a nail!  If you're in New Orleans, go see   Hedwig , opening tonight.  and  To   Holden Caulfield's Lover :  Bon voyage!  Can't wait for further tales of Arizona and marital bliss...  If you're in Milwaukee, the best show in town is closing this weekend...  That is all.  Please resume your normal lives.
