Splendor In The Grass  "You know I love you very much, don't you?"  He looked at me for a long moment, deciding just how serious I was, then gave my nose a quick, perfunctory lick and bounded over me, each of four paws landing either on face, windpipe, chest or stomach, to where his ball was.  Although it was just sitting there, he pounced on it like a jungle animal, batting it with his paws, and it took about 8 seconds before he was hogtied by his leash and plopped back into the grass with a sigh, with a little flash in his eyes that said "I meant to do that."  I've spent too many hours worrying about the quality of Dex's life, and how having a dog in the city has hindered mine, but then we have a couple of hours like this afternoon and I can't imagine living without him.  In fact I start thinking about creating the kind of life where he could have a backyard and maybe a lake to swim in.  Not for me, for  him .  He gives me something outside of myself to care about, both concretely and abstractly, every day.  He's a warm body in bed; he's someone to talk to so I don't seem like a crazy person talking to myself; he misses me when I'm gone and he's always glad to see me when I'm back; when he puts his head on my lap, I relax completely, looking down as I type this he's laying at my feet and I feel cozy and kinda secure.  A sense of stability, I guess that's what it is.  I give him kibble and he gives me normalcy.  And, as weird as this may sound, he makes me laugh.  He tilts his head, furrows his brow and tries to understand me, or he thinks he's getting away with something and shoots me a nonchalant glance over his shoulder, or he chases his tail like a dervish (I know that's cliche, but you haven't seen  Dex  do it).  He's such a beautiful boy, and so smart, that I'm always proud walking down the street with him.  It's not an earthshaking blog, I just really love my dog right now and I had to tell you.
