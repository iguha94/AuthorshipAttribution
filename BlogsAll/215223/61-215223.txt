Is this what it's like to be old?  I'm not yet, I know that.  But the effort that it takes to move from my bed to the kitchen.  From the kitchen to the living room.  To get back up from the sofa.  Is it that I just can't shake the sleep?  That I don't want to change states from dreaming to waking?  I don't feel depressed, I have things I'm looking forward to, but every move I make is like swimming in syrup.  Slow.  Effort.  Tiring.  I manage to get to the gym, but my strength has decreased.  I refuse to go through the motions so I push my body and that feels good.  Right.  But the energy isn't sustained.  It drains.  I'm drained.  And every other sentence I type seems slow.  Old.  Rehashed.  So much I want to say, so little I want to listen to.  I'm neutral.  In neutral.  Lying in bed (but it's not the only place I lie) I think about strength of will.  Can't I will myself out of bed at 9am?  Can't I will the energy?  Perhaps, but it takes practice and practice takes time.  And effort.  I think it'll pass, and I have to believe it will.  Like an old person, I feel the younger inside, stirring, eager to accomplish.  But the heavy, wet, woolen overcoat prevents swift movement, or any movement.  The heat slows me down.  So much easier to fall into that narcoleptic state which, at least, prevents my worrying about it.
