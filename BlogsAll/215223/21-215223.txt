My Dawg's Better'n Yer Dawg  In the excitement of winning sex and previously-owned undergarments, I forgot to mention Rex the Wonder Puffin's special day.  He had three (3) Celebrity Encounters (which, frankly, is a step up from the chick magnet he's been to this point).  So with all due respect to other   Blog Dogs , here's Rex's Glamorous Day:  On our morning walk, as we passed the hotel next door,   Anne Robinson  was waiting for a taxi and pronounced my dog "The Cutest Link!"  Okay, she just said to him "Hello, aren't you cute?"  On our last walk, right in front of our house, talking into his cellphone, was   Bradley Whitford  ("Josh" from The West Wing).  He didn't really look at me, or stop talking on his phone, but spent a few minutes scratching Rexie's fuzzy little head and chest.  I was waiting for my turn, but alas, he's married.  To a woman.  But the biggest encounter came when we were leaving the Park in the afternoon.  As we were crossing CPS, a woman with a headset asked if we'd like to be in a movie.  I, jaded New Yorker (and SAG member) that I am, said no.  She said, "Awww, ya sure?  We really like your dog."  Of course I relented immediately.  She asked us to cross the street when the two actors on the other street started crossing and to pass them in the middle of CPS.  So, of course we did.  The two actors?  Meg Ryan and   Hugh Jackman .  My dog will forever have an endless supply of steak and smelly socks just for getting me that close to Hugh Jackman (mmm...Wolverine-licious).  All of that and RJ's soiled panties.  Maybe life's not so bad.
