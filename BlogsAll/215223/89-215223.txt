This is a city where people generally go out of their way to avoid contact with other people.  Not today.  People in the elevator asked if all of my friends had been accounted for, told me their friends' narrow escapes.  Walking Dex this morning, I passed people I pass almost every morning, plus a few strangers.  We met each other's eyes as we passed and exchanged a terse, but kind, smile.  Those of us that knew each other on sight but had maybe never spoken much or at all asked how the other was doing.  "Do you need anything?"  I thought I'd stop crying today, but I haven't.    The streets are still very deserted.  Times Square, the Crossroads of the World, is vast and empty.  The lights and neon blink and flash but there's no one to be impressed.  All Broadway shows were cancelled last night, as were all matinees today.  No movies.  Some restaurants are open, some are closed with hastily made signs.  One that I passed said "Eatery is closed today.  God Bless America."  Usually that would make me smirk.  Along Ninth Avenue, there are other signs of support like that, some in just marker that give directions to blood banks.  There's a five hour wait to give blood.  If you can.  One of the places I went wasn't set up for the onslaught.  One had a long list of qualifiers.  I don't qualify -- I'm gay.  But I'm not outraged, just sad that I can't help in that way.  Jon Jordan and I are going to the grocery store in a little bit.  We're going to buy lots of bread and meat and stuff and we're going to make as many sandwiches as we can.  Then we're going downtown.  We don't really know where, most of downtown below 14th Street is sealed off, but our plan is to get food to the people who've been working so hard and so long.  It's not a lot, probably a stupid idea, but I can't sit around crying anymore.
