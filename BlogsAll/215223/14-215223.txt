Model Behavior  Overheard this afternoon in the locker room of Prescriptive Fitness, NYC:   Model 1:  Hey, I thought you lived in L.A. Model 2:  I totally do!  I thought  you  lived in L.A. Model 1:  Totally!  But I've got a place here, too. Model 2:  I totally do, too.  Now all we need's a place in Paris. Model 1:  Right?  Except I  hate  being there for work. Model 2:  Oh, totally! [At this point, I'm thinking: if you call walking a flat platform to the end, turn around without falling, and walking back  work , then, yeah, I can see why you'd hate it.]  Model 2:  How's your place here? Model 1:  Totally small compared to what I have on the Coast. Model 2:  Yeah, same here, totally.  My friends can't believe what I pay. Model 1:  Oh god,  totally .  But convenient.  Wake up and everything's right there. [Me:  Yeah, right next to the thesaurus.]  Model 2:  Well, I've got a go-see, later dude. Model 1:  Later.  Now, of course, besides feeling fat and ugly, I really hate them both on principal (if we can't hate the beautiful and vapid, who can we hate?).  Until Model 1 cruises me really hard on his way to the showers.  He's tall, dark hair, blue eyes, ripply stomach.  He's so lean and cut, he looks a little like a prawn, but a  sexy  prawn.  Still.  While I'm stewing in self- and other sorts of loathing, Prawn Boy comes back and cruises me again.  Not subtly, but I assume subtlety doesn't figure largely in his life.  Maybe he's just never seen a person with an extra 10 pounds.  I continue dressing and, once more, The Prawn walks slowly by, stares, smiles.  I'm forced to laugh at myself for enjoying a quirky sense of power and, just for a second or two, hating him a little less.  And I think to myself:   Totally!
