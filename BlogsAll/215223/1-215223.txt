Big Orange Bike  Got my ass up!  Got it on the Big Orange Bike!  Biked from the   Intrepid  all the way down to the   Museum of Jewish Heritage  and back.  It was glorious!!  I biked past people I knew and people I wish I knew, past tourists going the wrong way on the bike path and even past the Magickal Colorist (although we didn't try to reconnect...guess we've learned that lesson).  I forgot how much that ride opens up my senses.  Feeling the wind, watching the river...it makes all the hideousness better for the moment.  Pluth's back in town.  We grabbed a quick   lunch .  Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet man.  Lucky to have that friendship.  The Evil Empire is as dull as usual, but it's all okay 'cause the Big Orange Bike made it okay.  And while it's quiet I can do my blogging and my   blog    stalking .  On my ride this morning, I actually thought I'd spotted one of my   blog stalkees ...what would I have done had it actually been he?  Say hi?  Bike past again to see if I got cruised?  God, that's just creepy.  Although more of a possibility than me actually saying hi, I'd guess.  I'm not even sure of the ethics of IMing Those   Bloggers  Who Intruigue:  Am I bugging them?  How do I even approach that without foisting upon them perhaps unwanted Blog Celeb Status?  And when will I figure out Blogger enough, and have the balls, to link other Blogizens?  That would be SO   grown up ...  The SF Potential BF is coming into town this weekend...not even sure I think it's a good idea for us to meet face to face, but with all of our mutual friends, I suppose we shall.  Why do the cute, smart ones always live on the other side of the country in a semi-fog of Californian aloofness?
