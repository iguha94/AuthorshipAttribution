Reduce Speed Ahead  So I'm at the gym, doing arms, the gym's not full and I have nowhere to be until tomorrow at 1pm.  And I'm antsy.  I can't get through it quickly enough.  I'm distracted and trying to figure out what I can do later or in the morning.  How I can rearrange entire chunks of my life?  How can I start on the next exercise while I'm resting from the previous?  And I said it out loud:  "Slow down."  Why is that so hard for me to remember?  Doing things step by step, being only in the moment in which I exist, taking my time...these do not compute.  It's impatience.  It's anxiety.  What it  isn't  is, in actuality, moving my life forward in any way.  I get overwhelmed.  I start thinking about the next thing that needs to be done before the first one is finished.  You should see me trying to clean my apartment.  I start in the bedroom, say, cleaning the top of my dresser.  I find something that needs to go in the living room.  I take it to its proper shelf and I realize it needs dusting.  I go to the kitchen to get the Endust and a rag and, under the sink is that lighting fixture that I keep meaning to put up in the dining room.  So I pull it out and put it on the dining room table so I'll remember to do it right after...right after.  Oh yeah, the dresser in the bedroom.  Is this A.D.D.?  Or am I just a scatterbrained mess?  (Remember when submitting your answer that the former comes with delicious pharmaceuticals.)  I've got to force myself to slow down, do one thing at a time.  I can't skip over the mundane tasks of life, I have attend to each and allow each to take the time it takes.  But how do I remember to do that?  Tape notes all around the apartment?  Meditation?  Yoga?  Quaaludes?  This should be interesting...  If you run into me, remind me to slow down, okay?
