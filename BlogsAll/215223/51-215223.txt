I've Got A Golden Ticket!  Okay, it's  silver ...but so what?  I'm going to the Tony Awards!  Yay Me!!  Of course, it's black tie and I don't have a tux anymore (my shoulders got to big for it...poor me).  So I'm wearing the black fake Prada suit, with a vintage 60s pink tux shirt with French cuffs (no cufflinks), no tie, eye Kohl, lip gloss, JSquared buzzed my hair last night so it's spiky with lots of grey showing through (might throw a little glitter in it), some sorta chain-y something around my neck, clunky boots.  Since I'm with the Rocky Horror contingent and going to their party at Studio 54 after, pseudo-glam rock is the order of the night.  Don't worry   baby , it's not shabby-chic-a-licious.  I just went for a little tanning session, walked Dexter, gonna hop in the shower soon, a little Biore self-heating mask, Kiehl's White Eagle shaving cream, mint shampoo...oh yeah.  I'm feeling great about tonight.  I've always loved the Tonys.  It's Drama Fag Christmas.  As a kid in Ybor City, the Tonys were my only real connection to Broadway.  That and cast albums.  Yeah, as in LPs.  I remember watching those numbers just dazzled, thinking how talented and lucky those people were, wondering what a Broadway theatre looked like inside.  Now those people are my friends, those theatres are part of my neighborhood.  Tonight I'm gonna have a ball.  I'm gonna force myself to talk to people I'm in awe of, I'm gonna be happy for everybody who wins, I'm gonna feel sassy and celebrate with my community.  I'm not gonna be afraid.  I'm gonna be a part of it.  Yay me!
