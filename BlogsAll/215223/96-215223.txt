Open Letter To New York City  Don't be mad, baby.  Look, it's not like we're breaking up or anything.  I just think we need some time apart.  I need some "me" time.  We've been together a long time.  I know you're feeling it, too.  It's natural.  So I'm just gonna go South to get my head straight, relieve some stress.  But you know I'll think about you every day.  When we met, I was still a kid, but you'd been around.  And you had plenty to teach me...but I like to think I taught you a thing or two.  We had a lot of fun then, remember?  Nothing was really serious.  You'd throw big parties, we'd stay up all night, you'd have people over from all over the world, celebrities.  It was glamorous and carefree.  But we've both changed.  I mean, frankly, the last two years you haven't reached for the tab once.  I don't mind paying every once in awhile, but this has gotten out of hand.  And all the cosmetic changes?  There are parts of you now that didn't exist when we met.  Yeah, there've been good things, too.  I know you like the back of my hand.  I know your moods.  I know how you get around the holidays, and especially right after.  I know how you like to spend a Sunday morning, all sleepy and quiet and reflective.  The way I can sometimes turn a corner and you'll catch me completely by surprise.  And how you pull through in a crisis.  But you can be too much for one guy.  I'm tired and I need a little break.  But you know I'll be back.  How could I stay away from you?  I grew up with you, became a man with you.  You taught me how to take it on the chin and laugh at it later.  Let's face it:  you're the love of my life.  You sigh and give me that look right now, but tomorrow you'll be busy and it'll almost be like I was never here.  Almost...but not quite.  And when it gets to be five in the morning, quiet as hell and no taxis 'cause their shifts are changing over, the time you used to walk me home from the clubs.  Think of me.  I Love New York.
