          coffee and cigarettes  lately, i've really taken to hanging out in coffee shops instead of bars. the bar scene gets tired after repeated exposure, though i still love going out for a smokey smoke. i'm also tired of drinking, after a week-long respite from alcohol, last night i had a drink at 2a with   joe  and gary, who made their first appearance in my new hood! i was actually about to go to bed when i got the call at 1 in the morning from joe. and i was like, "when is joe  ever  in my nabe?" never! so i need to hang with him while his jokey ass is here. hanging with joe is like laughing in spring time. joyous as he's a primo comedian who likes to greet me in a lovely british accent: 'ello, jin! where's my gin? gary is his best friend from erie, who is probably one of the nicest, down to earth guy i've met. we all talked about how in erie, $5 for a beer is simply preposterous. yeah i said it, preprosterous. let's just say that they tip with quarters in erie -- that's how cheap the beer is!  there we met up with   jay  and   noah  (happy double-two birthday!) jay had just seen the bouncing souls and was wearing a cute green cap, his lip piercing still in place. i'm surprised the ruffians at the concert hadn't ripped that off. noah was sufficiently drunk, and told me he was going to the moz/shins show tonight. i'm utterly jealous.
