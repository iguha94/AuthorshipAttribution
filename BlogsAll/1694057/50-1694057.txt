          rough trade  this week has been kinda rough. some good things, some bad things. there has been this huge anxiety building up within me these past couple days. i've been trying to fight it off, but it's kinda weighing me down emotionally. though i always try to be my perky lil' self. think happy thoughts. happy thoughts!  ...   pela  . whoa, they totally stepped it up a notch or 10 at their mercury lounge show on tuesday. the volume of their show has gotten considerably louder, and billy is as passionate at the mic as ever. these are the kind of guys who wear their heart on their sleeves. love love them all! they also have this great new drummer who makes rock faces while he's pounding the beats. i love bands that look like they're having a lot of fun while their songs are bursting out of the monitors. full force. a good performance needs great songs, great spirit, and charismatic players. all was had by pela. also had lots of fun listening to their manager, lee, tell his biz stories. this is what i imagine touring life must be like -- sitting around in musty rooms with my peeps, smoking and drinking and telling stories that draw laughter and bring us closer together. sorry i don't have any photos. i brought my temporary digicam with me but then realized there was no smart media card in it. d'oh!!
