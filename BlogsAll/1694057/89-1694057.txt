          the paper chase & foreign sounding bands  i can't stop watching   this video  for   the paper chase . can't wait to see their nervous, twisted rock at   north six  on friday (june 25). they're playing with   we ragazzi , another band i've been meaning to check out, but my plans just never work out. all the stars are aligned this friday though. you should come out too! that is if you're not planning on   les savy fav  and   q and not u  at   volume  or   iron & wine  at   bowery  or   enon  and   mellowdrone  at   rothko  or   saintface  at   sin-e . holy shit! too many choices.   UPDATE:  I forgot to mention another great show on Wednesday, June 23 @ rothko. Some of my favorite bands are playing it: Local faves   Asobi Seksu  (which means "play sex" in Japanese -- rawr!) and   Au Revoir Simone  (i believe that is a peewee's playhouse reference? anyhoo, these four ladies are dreamy electronic pop) and   Mellowdrone  (who i've only seen solo, but he's amazing and i can't wait to see the full band play!)  let's also not forget   sam champion  (very reminiscent of one of my faves, pavement) at luna lounge (free show!) on thursday, june 24, with   these bones , who do a funny cover of britney spears' "toxic." show starts at 10...  or if you get a chance, my friend jumee's friend, miho hatori, who used to be in cibo matto is playing solo at pianos at 9 on thursday, june 24. one of anna's friend's band,   the quick fix kills , are also playing that show.
