         any movie featuring scenes in north six and with a poster for    the walkmen   in it deserves props from me.  school of rock  was cute, but what was up with the mooney suzuki cameo?    the drunk dictionary.  this dictionary translates male drunk talk:  guy says:  so, i'm in a band...  translation:  please have sex with me because you think i'm cool.   guy says:  i'm pretty drunk. will you walk me home?  translation:  will you go home and have sex with me?   guy says:  sure, you get this round -- the next one is one me.  translation:  we won't be here long enough for another round, dumbass.    more pick up lines.  some of the ones that made me laugh were: 1) hey did you fart? because you blew me away! 2) i may not be the best looking guy here but i'm the only one talking to ya! 3) ok i'm here. what's your next wish?  and this one is for doug in DoP -- use it on annie: 4) Hi, my name’s Doug. That’s "God" spelled backwards with a little bit of "u" in it.  need to break up with your boo? try these   brutal break up lines.  i like this one: it isn't you. i'm in love with your brother.   hahahahaha!!
