         well well well. chico has posted a wonderful jinners story on his blog,   Rock n Roll in the Real World . folks, i think that deserves a spot on my list of peeps. thanks chico! also i realize i need to add more people to that list of peeps. word.  in other blogger news, there is   an indiscernable PR piece on blogger gurls  in that uppity alternative nyc paper,  new york press , featuring jasper (ahem, gurl?), laura and audrey. i couldn't figure out what this story was about -- "vicious", the modern age, blogger "gurls" or how blogs have slowly become yet another PR tool for pushy publicists? all i have to say is that i didn't care about  new york  rock until i heard the walkmen. and for that i thank miker, who gave me their cd before it was even released. smooches, miker!  and kudos to isaac for having the coolest fucking record label ever. shuddup, naysayers.  were you at siren wearing your best pointy shoes and polka-dotted tube?   then you're probably one of these people.  thanks, nina. click for slideshow   here .  the strokes get all new-wavey on us [  billboard ]:   In particular, tracks like the hand-clapping "Supernova" (a "first single contender," according to Ralbovsky) and "I Can't Win" feature more of a new wave-vibe than "Is This It," thanks to bright guitar lines that replicate frontman Julian Casablancas' vocal melodies.      the shins make basement tapes... due out in october . and to answer the mystery, that top model girl was dating the keyboardist. i wonder if singer james mercer is single? tickets for the shins tickets at the bowery ballroom on sept. 2 go on sale today... it's going to sell out quick. i have one ticket for sept. 3. anyone want it?  who needs a   photobooth , when one has a digital camera and a   fotolog ?
