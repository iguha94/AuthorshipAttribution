          the revolution will be televised   just when i was beginning to think that aurelio's hair and eyes were prettier than calla's music, something completely changed my mind. wow, my mouth dropped wide open when    calla   played the last song of their set last night, "televised"... then i couldn't stop talking about how amazing that song was to doug. how amazing it was when they softly played the song like it was going to end and then how they crescendo'd right back into the song. i was completely blown away, and that one moment made up for all of the duller ones. it put me into an instant daze. i loved the way aurelio moved on stage. it looked like he was walking through the crowded streets of tokyo, manuevering his guitar around people -- like his guitar was swimming around the stage. and i loved how he was making out with the microphone. what a fucking sensual being.        the cooper temple clause  ... someone yelled out, "the cooper temple clause, the cooper temple pilots: same thing!" and it was kinda true, but not really. i love this band's ability to delve into so many different elements and mix mish mashes of things together to create a wall of sound that could be taken as a lotta rock, a little bit of hip hop and a little bit of jazz, they were great. i love tom bellamy, the guy with the stache who reminded me and doug of a shorter angus andrew from liars. i love guys like that. he was wild on stage, just letting it all loose and i enjoyed watching him. you could probably say i have a new crush, folks! turns out he's the one i interviewed last week, and he was indeed nice, but definitely has a girlfriend. my favorite song of the night was of course "blind pilots" -- the song i have playing on my ipod endlessly in all my playlists. fucking love that song. you only need one really good one to win me over, at least for now, in this temporary moment of blogginess.   earlier in the night, i stopped by vicious to see    the gostation   again. i had seen them play before with aerial lovefeed at don hill's and was curious as to how they would sound at sin-e. i had recently befriended doug the lead singer of the band, and found he has a great presence on the stage. i like watching people who look confident when they are behind the mic. it might be sort of an obvious point, but rock stars have to look like they want to own the stage, and doug definitely has that going on, without being annoying like some people can be... anyways, they covered new order, and that's always fucking cool in my book. it was fun, and i was definitely glad doug went with me. incidentally, we ran into the other doug (the gostation) again at the cooper temple clause, who loves tctc. rock on! audrey and dennis were dj'ing, and she informed me that i missed "the rat." rats!!!!!! next time i will have to arrive earlier so i can dance my ass off to that, eh? i was in good spirits, dancing all around with jo jo and jocelyn and whoever. it was fun being a lil' tipsy. so we added a fourth member to  "excuse, moi"  -- miss jojo dancer on drums! how hawt is that? ok, you think i'm silly. but really, i'm just happy.   even earlier in the night, i was having after-work drinks with ma' girls at pianos while  surefire  was soundchecking. we ran into justin from    bishop allen   there, who was cracking us up with his chipped tooth. we nicknamed his adorableness "snaggletooth" and drank and talked about boston. (everyone had gone to school in boston 'cept for moi.) we were all giggling because surefire were so cute, and they kinda sounded like the monkeys or something -- i love the monkeys! it was cool... now i want to see surefire again. fo' sho! wouldn't it be funny if everyone started callin' them sho'fire! that would be awesome and completely snoopified. unfortunately i will miss the band when they play with dirty on purpose at the hook, but if you're all around, you should go support!! march 20 @ the hook. mark your calendars, babe. also, dennis cahlo is performing, and we all know how good that boy is. and he gives the best hugs of any singer 'round town! so ask him for one.  i told justin i would come see bishop allen at lit on friday. you should come too. it will be loads of fun! and probably the last chance you'll get to see them for a month because of their crazy tour schedule. justin told me the band would be at sxsw the whole week next week, so i'll definitely run into him again down there. every day i meet someone who's going to the festival. it's going to be fucking insane!!!!!!!!! insane!!!!!!!!
