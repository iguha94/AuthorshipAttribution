          wha tha?  geez, where the hell have i been? yesterday i had been drinking since like 1 p.m. it was a day of holiday party after holiday party after holiday party. i totally lost my cookies at virgil's for my work's departmental holiday dinner. that was after 4 glasses of bubbly. i shoulda slowed down the pace because then i had to go to   another holiday party  and i was just such a wuss. my head was aching and i couldn't find any water! go figure. just more alcohol. so shortly after greeting several of some   lovely    lovely    lovely  peeps, i bid adieu and cabbed it home.   the other weekend, i saw anna's band   knife skills . the only word to describe them is BADASS. they are fucking badass. with all of their practicing and rehearsing and recording, they fucking ruled that small sin-e stage, and seemed destined for bigger halls of music. anna's vicious vocal and guitar skills. fon lin's sexy voice and basslines. jerry's machine gun drums. watch out, people. you have no idea!  at some point i also went to see my friend miker's jokey robert palmer cover band, dr. doctor, and it was fun times singing along to those songs. i kind of wish that they were dressed up with slicked back hair and red lipstick. that would have been fucking hawt. isaac kept playing songs by people like crystal waters ("she's just like you and me but she's homeless!") and jody watley?? ("real love! i'm searching for a real love!") i found out last night that i had missed brian long's set at the startime holiday party. he was the first DJ, but i'm sure i'll catch him another time.  oh and for those of you who missed the panthers show at "the lounge" the other night (me included), paris hilton and seth green was there. woopty-doo. i hope she was at least flashing people and saying, "i'm not spoiled."  jesus, i honestly don't remember what else i've been doing. i know there was something else that i did? please feel free to remind me.
