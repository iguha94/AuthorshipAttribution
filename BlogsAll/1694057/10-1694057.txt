           last night, annabiotica and i rushed downtown to the knitting factory to see three of our favorite guys in the new york rock scene:    jude, luke and dAve  . when we got to the box office we found they annointed us with nicknames on the guest list: anna "kicking ass and taking names" barie and uh, jinners. the box office guy smiled and asked, "how am i supposed to ID you gals?"   we snuck into the green room and greeted the boys, thanked them for putting us humble and po' girlies on the list. then minutes later,    qatsi   took the knitting factory stage and totally kicked ass on that tiny stage (was it always that itty bitty?).   this new york trio gets tighter and tighter every time, and they are a joy to watch on stage. dAve really gets theatrical on stage... at times it seems like playing guitar is musical masturbation for him, and he continually flirts with the crowd. we wanted more luke (aka more drums!) 'cuz he's a giant drummer in more ways than one, and we wanted the music to pound more. and jude's voice was in stellar condition as he got all hot and sweaty under those stage lights. and we ate it up when he jumped off stage for that song we can't remember the title of. what's the title of that song???     ***  anyhoo, a coupla my friends work for the PR company that represents narciso rodriguez. isn't his   spring 2004 collection  totally hot? not very indie or hipster, true, but if you walked into a club wearing   these numbers , the rock stars would be drooling all over you, fo sho.  ***    why are there praying mantis on the subway? it freaked everyone on the train. nature gets too close to us nyoo yawkers again!   ***  happy belated birthday, cameron. may you find your gravy train!
