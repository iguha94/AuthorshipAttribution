Tues March 2nd @ Passerby... If you were at our Halloween party 2 years ago you may remember this. If not, you may have heard about it. And many who were there never saw it due to the viewing room being too crowded! We took 40+ artists and divided the first  Black Sabbath  album into 40+ 1 minute clips. Each artist was assigned a clip and did a film, video or animation based on their clip. We then reconnected the clips to create one continuous soundtrack with a whole bunch of shorts over it. Some of the artists include..... Tunde Adebimpe, William Henry Beck IV, Warren Bennett, Joe Bradley, Crystal Bahmaie, Richard "DJ" Boudreau, Ben Coccio, Chris Coccio, Bjorn Copeland, Benji Cossa, Luke Crotty, Jim Drain, Madaline Davy, Caleb Emerson, Andy Estep, Dan Gorman, Andrew Freiband, Kaori Hamura, Sharon Hardy, Christy Karacas, Larisa Laivins, Richard 'Dicko' Mather, Ben Murray, Keith McCullock, Amanda McCorkle, Matt Keegan Rapheal Lyons, Takeshi Murata, Rich Porter, Jason Rothenberg, Ryan Sovereign, Francine Speigel, Kevin Umbrict Stephen Warbrick, Aaron Warren, Sara Welsh, + a couple more I'm sure I left out!!!
