          HAPPY BIRTHDAY,   ANNABIOTICA !  as part of her birthday present, i took anna out on the town to see dresden dolls. this band  sleepytime gorilla museum  opened for dresden dolls -- we had no idea what we were in for! they were kind of cliche experimental pagan rock of sorts, interesting at first, but in the end, they were simply tiring and entirely predictable. snore! yawn! headache! i did like the girl in the band though. she could go solo and be quite successful. creepy, but in a good way.     dresden dolls  were great, but not the best i've seen them. maybe amanda was tired from playing the night before. maybe she was bummed half the place emptied out after sleepytime (bizarro). but me, i just can't get over "half jack." what an amazing song. some goth girl yelled at me for taking photos. damn, that was the first time someone ever yelled at me for snapping a few photos. what the hell?  currently spinning: cooper temple clause seafood damien rice mono folksongs for the afterlife french kicks brendan benson dresden dolls dirty on purpose  finally decided i hate the  franz ferdinand  ep (enough to want my money back!!), although "darts of pleasure" is completely danceable. don't hate me, ultragrrrl. on the other hand, i can't get enough of  the cooper temple clause . "blind pilots" is amazing. i've also been consuming  damien rice  in large quantities. "delicate" is the bestest.
