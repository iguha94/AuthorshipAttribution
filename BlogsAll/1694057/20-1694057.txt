         stopped by the mercury lounge to drop off copies of this awesome poster joe made for    dirty on purpose  's next show -- they're opening up for  the decemberists  and  earlimart  on oct. 29. i saw modest babs at the merc, and remembered she started working there a few weeks ago. she's totally sweet, smart, and into good music. LOVE her.  dirty is also playing   vicious  on nov. 18. it's going to be totally hot.  to support some work peeps, i stopped by the sidewalk cafe for the "writers at night" series they have every month... but i was feeling kind of tired and decided to head home da 'burg.   anna was meeting up with fellow    knife skillers   fon lin and jerry (turing machine), and so i decided to stop into union pool and say hello. of course, i ended up staying there for a little bit... but i just drank water. we had so much fun despite the weirdly, out-of-place romantic music.  after a lot of research on    jason mraz  , i knew that he wore a red and white trucker hat every now and then... so i think i spotted him again at union pool tonight, hanging with some friends. but i'm kind of blind, so i can't be 100% sure. it did look like him a lot.
