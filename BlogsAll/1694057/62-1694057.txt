          i feel like reposting this so...  i've been reading my old blog, and it's been so funny. like a trip down memory lane. and i thought i'd repost this funny article i wrote over a year ago:   How To Get Over My Band Obsession:  1) Get one of the members of the band to offend me in some unforgivable way. Like, don't you hate it when a guy asks you about your gorgeous best friend?  2) Every time I hear the band's music, I can zap myself with a taser to the beat of their drum until I have negative associations. It worked for Pavlov, it can work for me, damnit!  3) Just get over my shyness and make out with the keyboardist already…  4) Go all out and make out with all of the band members.  5) Stop being such a drug addict and snap out of my star fucker phase. Besides, guys rarely look as sexy when you're sober. Am I right, ladies?  6) Pretend they're all 12 years old. Jailbait is so passé. Pass it on!  7) Take some scissors to their next show and cut off all their irresistibly dirty indie rock hair. Remember, Samson and Delilah?  8) Give the rock star the worst pick up line ever and run away in horror, never to go near him again. Just like the time I ran into Steve Malkmus in a library… "Er, I, like, really like your music…Der…"  9) Keep telling myself they all look like Keith Richards naked (or at least, they will sooner or later).  10) Meet another band to obsess over. Ooooh, shit!
