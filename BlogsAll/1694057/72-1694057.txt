          those kids  you know, those kids you always run into at shows, on sidewalks on sunny days in new york, in dingy, smoky bars in the wee hours of the morning? yeah, those kids. love them.   you know who you are.   in other news, i finally saw noah from   sam champion  do his solo thang at the mercury lounge this past weekend. sure it was a stripped down version of the cd i've been listening to... but i really liked what i heard -- the kind of shy guy behind the mic who sings quirky lyrics with humor, wit and a bit of charm. stephie and i liked him so much we gave him our drinks. i especially love "TV Fever" and that song that Jay calls his "cuddle song"... the band's next show is: may 20 @ pete's candy store  709 lorimer st, williamsburg, brooklyn, ny 10:30 pm // 21+ // free.   we also went and supported bsiii in the off-broadway play he's in,   the moonlight room . the play is set in a hospital waiting room -- it's the kind of play that has a lot of witty repartee, along with moments of silence that almost act as other characters in the story. as the play unfolds, and you begin to figure out the complexity of the characters, you see that there's always more going on with people than it originally seems. this is a lot like life, we all hide behind painted exteriors that can slowly peel and chip away in floods of hardship and reality checks. and as the play progresses, you see the characters aren't always what they seem. if you get a chance, you should check out the play. call 212-239-6200 or 800-432-7250 to reserve tickets. use discount code (MRGR645) for $10 off ticket price!
