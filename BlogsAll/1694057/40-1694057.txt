          we're the unicorns and we're people too       even though it was snowing, i went with deron and anna to southpaw (they drove) to see    the unicorns   play at southpaw. one of the first things out of one of the unicorns' mouth was, "this show is so much better than last night. pianos sucks." hmmm, i heard it was crazyfest! but let me tell you, southpaw was jampacked with people, and y'all know that venue is a pretty big size. the buzz was'a buzzing.    CHECK OUT THE PHOTO GALLERY !!   also check out real player video clips of the unicorns: *   unicorns 1  *   unicorns 2  *   unicorns 3  *   unicorns 4   i'm writing up a formal review on popmatters.com, but my overall impression of the unicorns was first amusement, pleasant surprise to later yawn-eriffic to then amused again to confused to amused to physically tired of watching their "grody roadie" dance around spitting beer, throwing condoms all in a unicorn uniform. all in all a good show, but way too long. however, there was some kylie thrown in there. laura will love that. thank god they didn't do "hey ya." aren't we getting tired of people covering outkast? maybe not.  right before the unicorns we ran into susan. she said that she liked the unicorns after seeing them at mercury lounge. i was kind of surprised, but after i saw them, i felt the same way. i also met doug who books at lit, does version city records, blah blah blah. he was nice. his label is putting out the amber smith cd... i also saw  vaz  and  the amber smith  but i'll talk about them in a separate post...
