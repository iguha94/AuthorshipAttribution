          all in time  you already know this, but i really dig that new    pela   song, "all in time." so damn catchy! caught the band again at sin-e this weekend and had such a blast. billy was extra active on stage, bashing and crashing around. and nate, eric and josh were so awwwn it as well. i especially love nate's catchy-as-hell guitar parts. their new drummer was also rockin' out and is quite fun to watch... but you've heard me spill time and time again for pela.  after their set, i SPRINTED to the living room to see   dennis cahlo  from  the realistics  do his solo thang. let me tell you how sweet his voice is... it's so soft, and his falsetto just melts into the air, swirling around and unraveling like an intimate secret whispered into your ear. it's a dizzying spell, like almost kisses and hands accidently brushing up against your arms. his acoustic songs made me giddy. and his tender cover of my favorite realistics song, "why didn't you stay?", just blew me away -- to the point i was sitting in my chair, singing along, my heart tingling with each wonderful lyric. the girls are gonna swoon big time when his solo album comes out. and i thought it was totally sweet how he dedicated pretty much every song to   my favorite frenchie !
