          movie aside  if you thought for a second that getting stoned and watching    van helsing   was going to be a good idea, i can re-assure you ahead of time that it is NOT. thanks, joe...  after that horrible movie experience, george, joe and i meandered to the east east village to rue b, a saucy lil' bar on avenue b complete with a classy piano player. the place was kinda small, and i bumped into the piano player and made him mess up his song. sorry, kiddo! there we met up with a man by the name of daniel sasse (pronounced like that teen magazine of yore). i kid you not. what an amazing name to live up to... and peeps, he certainly did live up to that name. his talk was amazingly involved and strangely entrancing. i fell asleep on his couch for 15 minutes. but he made us amazing coffee in four minutes with a french press. we were impressed. and awake.  then george and i, newly awakened, wandered over to pianos, where the shins and any number of other comedian and celebrity hipster types were all sipping on clear cocktails with limes and chillin' after the big bowery ballroom show. i heard their gig with moz on friday night was splendid! as was SNL with the olsen twins and their bowery gig with the hold steady -- as DT put it, "their best show i've seen them in ever which includes about 20 shows or so." wow, big praise!  my dj gig went fine, and it was so much fun to spin music that i like listening to. i'll be spinning again with   miss melody nelson  at a huge listening party with   dirty on purpose ,   the thermals ,   say hi to your mom , catheter and more that jay good times is putting together. that kid has so much love for music, it makes me inspired. save the date: may 20! check the   on the moon music  calendar for details as they develop!
