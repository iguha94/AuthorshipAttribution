          you give me fever    i went to   the fever  listening party last night for their upcoming album,  red bedroom . it was packed full of peeps, and you can't really beat $2 beer, unless of course it's free. songs like "labor of love" and "hexxxed" get me energized -- so much so that i felt my body moving, despite the comatose state my brain was in. as   miss modernage  has already stated, the album illustrates the band's diversity, and if possible, their songs are even catchier this time around than on their  pink on pink  ep. bravo, kids! if you haven't bought   tickets  to their record release show at bowery ballroom yet, you should grab them quick. i hear they're going fast!  i talked for a little bit with brian long, who manages   vhs or beta . you might also know him as the guy who put together the  yes new york compilation . he got me siked for the new vhs or beta album,  night on fire , where craig pfunder debuts his vocal artistry. he also talked about his experiences in the music industry and how he got into managing a band, which i thought was cool. i love to hear stories like that because it inspires me. the album comes out in a couple weeks... i'll let you know what i think of it when i get the cd.  holy mother of gosh. i am drinking a berry-lime   jamba juice  from the whole foods on columbus circle. it is so good! but a and were saying cherry-lime would have been infinitely better. just something to consider...
