          diesel wha?    ok i went to see   au revoir simone  play at pianos last night -- met up with new friends dave and chris. the ARS girls were in top form last night and covered bruce springsteen's "dancing in the dark." hot shit!   more au revoir simone photos:            dave, chris and i headed over to the diesel party after their set, and on the way got the call from   cameron : there were too many people at the party and no one can get in. too bad we were already in a cab heading over. whatever! if you went to the party/show, tell me how it went? i also said hello to the   bishop allen  kids standing outside the show. they couldn't get in either. boo!  afterwards, dave went home (boo!) and chris and i hung out at alt cafe where mike was working. i had an iced coffee, and after i got home, i went right to sleep. coffee has no effect on me anymore. so sad!  this morning i put on moz's "do your best and don't worry" again and it made me feel so good. it's probably his most uplifting song ever, eh?  right now i am entranced with the   on!air!library!  cd. there's always been something in their moodiness that has caught my attention and my heart. ever since i saw them in that dank basement of cb's gallery with their million-part instrumentation and their haunting vocal melodies... and eery chords and sounds, i have been swept up in the rush of o!a!l!
