          more lit shit  went to see another friend's band   circle and square  play at lit last night. i was really exhausted from partying the night before, but got myself siked up for the show anyways. two nights hanging out at lit is kind of too much. but such is life. circle and square is a band that has been around for a while. they have their shit down. so when they're on stage, all four members perform tizzight. it just looked so natural. to me they kind of sound emo-ish, punk... very catchy.   other bands performing were  kilowatthours  and  soundtrak . there was one song that kilowatthours played, it was the last song of their set -- an instrumental -- that was just really pretty and magical. i was actually surprised. it was gentle at heart. i like! i like! by the time soundtrak got on stage, i wasn't really paying attention too much. but from what i heard, they are very strokes-ish. i will have to see them again some time i think to really form a solid opinion. what d'ya'll think?  some peeps were hungry so we went foraging the cold city for food. i was a dumbass and wore a skirt -- so i froze my ass off all night. we all headed over to the new   misshapes  party in the west village at a bar/lounge called luke and leroys -- a two story mini-club. we got there kinda late -- 2-ish, so the party was actually kind of winding down. we hung out for a little bit -- it was good to see all the bloggers in tow. and the most outrageous part of the party was the last song i stayed for -- the walkmen's "the rat." ultragrrrl instantly pulled me on to the dance floor and a bunch of us freaked out, screaming those hammy lyrics. love love!  spent the rest of the night at a friend's place just listening to loads of really cool music that was new to me. it was pretty awesome. then i completely passed out, in a drunken haze that had me in and out of consciousness. i hadn't stayed up that late in forever. it was a crazy, but memorable night. thanks to all.
