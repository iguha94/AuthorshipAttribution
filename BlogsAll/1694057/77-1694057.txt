          come on, let's go to sin-e to see pas/cal!    i got to see   pas/cal  for the second time in my life last night, and they were oodles of adorable splendor. i love everything about them, from their pink accented outfits to their nerdy glasses to their love of tambourines to caz' sweet and dear voice to their often goofy storytelling. this band makes this girl goofy and geeky, in a good way.    plus they have great matching shoes. word.  i was quite baffled by the huge turnout for openers,   elkland , who were like handsome boy modeling 16-year-olds covering erasure songs with their cute, swept-over 'dos... it seemed they brought their entire high school to the party as sin-e quickly filled up with people whooping and hollerin' for more more more... i swear one song sounded very similar to "total eclipse of the heart" as the lead singer held dearly onto the mic stand and sang, "i really need you tonight..." oddly enough, the crowd asked for more and the band gave a rather lackluster encore. i think, however, if i was 15 and starry-eyed and a total hag again, i would have LOVED them. i can totally picture them playing the roxy with a bunch of people dancing like crazy under the disco ball.    the more disappointing part was that most people left after elkland and missed   shelby , a musically superior band that swayed from gentle vocals to fierce rock-out explosions. they surprised me with their beautiful violin parts and the singer's exceptional, soaring voice. i want to see more of this band.  i didn't get to stay and see much of   soundtrak . someone told me that they were like U2, but i didn't see that comparison at all from the one song i heard. what did everyone else think?
