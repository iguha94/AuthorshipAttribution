          moby  apparently,    moby   was at the sin-e show on saturday night to see    dirty on purpose  . he bought a cd, watched their set, and then left!! saryn will appreciate that.   a big thanks to all who showed up for the band. i love you all. shout out to all the amazing bands that dirty played with this weekend:   the eaves ,   the caufield sisters ,   trouble with sweeney ,   dennis cahlo ,   asobi seksu ,   the hong kong . what a fucking awesome weekend of music! we were grateful to be playing with such great bands. thanks also to doug at southpaw, jasper and audrey and asobi seksu for asking dirty to play. also thanks to   aeri  and her friends for filming both dirty shows. you are amazing, and i'm so happy we finally met in person! mwah! also thanks to the   misshapes  peeps for putting the afterparty together.  i ended the big weekend with a karaoke party at winnie's for goldenrod's birthday. i was so tired, but made my way over to chinatown... after a couple drinks, i was ready to sing my standards: "killing me softly" and "superstar." doug pointed out, "both those songs are depressing and both talk about crushing on rock stars." well, doesn't that perfectly describe jinners? haha. ;-)
