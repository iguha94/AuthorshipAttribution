          all lit up  i went to see anna's band   knife skills  last night. it feels really good to support a friend's band, especially because you get to see them grow and bloom as a performer. i feel like every time i see this band, the assault is more massive, more killer. their songs are short, to the point but just as deadly, like sharp, quick jabs to your racing heart. if you haven't seen this band, you haven't seen tough, sexy girls kick ass on the stage. i'm not talking about girls who LOOK tough. but girls who really let go and lead with their aggression. if you haven't seen this band, you are missing a phenomenal drumming maniac. i'm not talking about some guy who just bangs hard on the drums. i'm talking about insane beatings that would make the most vicious domestic abuser blush with envy. in short, get thee to a knife skills show soon! if you think you can handle it.   the forms  played afterwards, and they were pretty good through the first three songs. energetic, swaying, melodic, notes elliding into others... and then they began to sound the same on every song. they had a lot of energy and oomph, but could probably stand to fill out more diverse forms to break up their set a little bit. but perhaps the point was to reject form and standard lyrics for the more abstract vocals and the kind of music that melts into itself... a very interesting concept if you want to intellectualize it. i could be taking my thoughts too far though!!  i am so totaled now. i thought that you couldn't get hangovers with liquor, but i proved myself wrong by drinking the most i've drunk in a while: three makers and gingers and a shot of tequila. serious shit, man. and i think i'm ready to do it all over again tonight at the circle and square show. watch out for this girl. she is on a roll. she is talking in the third person... ok i'll stop now.
