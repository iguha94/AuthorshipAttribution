            it was heartwarming to see    bishop allen   take the stage at the bowery ballroom, under the red and blue glow of the stage lights... the cheering fans up front, us loyal followers who have been waiting for the group to return from their ambitious, long summer tour. and finally we get our fill of a band that's totally changing the sound of brooklyn. and they are getting lots of radio play on kexp.org, too, so i'm totally siked for them. john in the morning knows what's up!  they played my favorites and did a cover of talking head's "psychokiller." bonnie says they've been playing that cover all summer -- they did a great job of giving the song their own twang. some of my fave bishop allen tunes include "quarter to three," "eve destruction," "busted heart," "another wasted night," "little black ache," "charm school" and of course, "things are what you make of them." yep, they played all my faves -- though i have to say i love ALL of their songs. they are the shiznit, and you betta recognize. and a special hello to new bishop allen member christian o, the girl with mad skills on the xylophone.  after their show i chatted for a while with   a great photographer , and then the band and blake downstairs. then i pulled myself away to head over to vicious at sin-e. talked with jasper and audrey. said hello to luke, yannick, bill jr., hugged dennis, heard the candy butchers canceled the bowery show (fuckers!), chatted with some asobi seksu, wanted to see the fiery furnaces, but decided i couldn't cuz i was so tired. so tired! so now, folks, i'm off to bed.
