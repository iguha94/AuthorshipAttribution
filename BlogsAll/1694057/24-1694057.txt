         From our favorite new filmmaker Andrew:  As you probably know, we're up and running on this new film project--   This coming Tuesday, the 7th, we're shooting what will presumably be by far the most complicated scene of this mostly uncomplicated film, a performance scene in which the makeshift supergroup of   Justin Rice  on guitar + Kevin Micka on drums plays a couple of songs at the Northsix club in Williamsburg. (Where, we are told, they shot a scene for School of Rock...?) 66 N. 6th St., near the Bedford stop on the L. We need extras, folks who look like they might conceivably come out to a rock show. We don't need a lot of folks, Justin + Kevin are supposed to be a pretty underattended opening act.   Most of you have jobs and cannot hang around a rock club from 10am - 5pm on a Tuesday, which is what we need, but if you're considering quitting your job, now would be a good time. What's in it for you, I guess is (a) we buy you lunch + there's some snacks around, (b) the glamour/creative process blah blah blah, (c) you get to see a free concert, sort of, albeit a concert in which the same two songs get played over and over again...It's an adventure, an adventure.   And if you know anyone who you think would be up for this, please do forward this along, I'd appreciate it tremendously.  If you want to do it, e-mail me back asap and let me know. If you can't, no need to respond-- Thanks so very much, Very excited,  Andrew  ***  if anyone is interested,   email me  and i'll pass your message along!
