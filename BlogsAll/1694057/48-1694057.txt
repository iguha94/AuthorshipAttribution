          mr brightside  walking around las vegas is like being in a pedestrian terror trap. unlike new york, las vegas is anti-pedestrian. but after hearing from the hotel clerk that there was a 45-minute wait for cabs, i was like FUCK THAT I'M GONNA FUCKING WALK, in true new yorker fashion, of course. i started walking over to the strip, in a cynical kind of mood. but it was just so nice outside. i swear it felt like it was in the 70s, a pure joyous contrast to the east coast weather i was trudging through only a couple days earlier. warmth = good mood. i ambled on the streets directed only by the huge "harrahs" hotel silhouette on the skyline.   when i got there, i followed some people walking into the harrahs. of course i saw the casino floor and just sort of walked through the entire thing. the ka-ching of the slot machines were kind of enticing -- reminding me of the time i went to detroit and went to canada to gamble in the windsor casinos. i had lost $20 that day. today i wasn't really in the mood to play much of anything. soon i realized that there wasn't much to do in las vegas if you weren't in the mood to gamble. but seriously, who gambles on their own, right? i decided i would do that tonight when keith is around. today i would just walk around, soak in the gaudiness, take photos of things like the tourist i am, and go shopping! i'll spare you the details but here's some eye candy. i'm hoping to feel the energy of a song like  the killers ' "mr brightside" while i'm here in vegas. so far, no go.
