          that joke isn't funny anymore  Being in New York is definitely a privilege. Not only is it expensive to live here, it is one of the most competitive cities in the world. And at times when I think that everyone seems to have lost a sense of community, something comes along to prove me wrong.   Struggling to recover from Thursday night's drunken Makers & Ginger debauchery, I spent most of this weekend kitten sitting for my boss's friend who lives in Nolita. Walking out of that neighborhood was quite refreshing, the warmth of the sun and the myriad of shoppers buzzing along the sparkling sidewalks, happy because they don't have to go to work the next day. I was one of those shiny happy people.   I walked from Nolita to Alphabet City, where I was moving the very last of my stuff out of my two-month sublet. I was kind of sad to be leaving what I think is the heart of the city for me. I spent more time around Avenue A and B in the past two months than in the entire time I've been in the city, which is coming up on 7 or 8 years. I will miss the convenience of crossing through Thompkins Square Park and visiting Mike at Alt Cafe. Or heading over a block to some listening party at Hi-Fi. Or breaking down at 3:30 in the morning and eating San Loco tacos (evil!) Or meeting peeps for drunken fun at B-Side or 2A and walking home afterwards. That is the shizznit.   Now I am back in Williamsburg, a community forever labeled by rock mags everywhere as the birthplace of electroclash and New York's burgeoning indie rock scene. And I have to say, I have missed Wburg a lot. Many of my friends live in the 'burg and steadily I have missed that slower-paced community of friends. The city is immediate and swift. The borough is lounge-worthy and calming in a strange way.
