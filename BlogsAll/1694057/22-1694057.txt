            queen latifah  signs to the new cool label, vector recordings.  ken and jack also own the company that handles that really hyped tennessee band,  kings of leon .  their reach is growing so quickly! when i went to the KoL show at the Bowery, I had heard that jack was looking for an assistant at his label. now I know what they were talking about! too bad I like my job and don't want to leave it!  the free    dirty on purpose   show at   grand central bar  went better than we all thought it would. walking into the bar and realizing some people had to play around a pool table is kind of like a big train wreck, but only a band like DoP could pull it off and draw everyone in with their amazing music. it was beautiful. at many points, i didn't even feel like i was deathly sick from my miserable fall cold! oh, how their music warms me... after the show, the band was packing up their equipment and these guys across the street, who were throwing bottles of beer at people who i'm guessing are their enemies, kept yelling, "gentrification! fucking gentrification!" i kept thinking, perhaps these guys should use their anger for better things than throwing beer bottles at people and yelling big words from the   dictionary . sometimes i hate gentrification too, but i don't go around screaming it in the middle of the night, do i? i mean, i can barely afford to live in my neighborhood, and don't feel like i can move because apartments are so friggin' expensive now in wburg. but i certainly don't go around yelling at every hipster and hipsterette on the street. that's what crazy people do. they also try to kill people by hurling beer bottles. that was kind of scary, yo.  i'm waiting to hear the reports of the realistics show at the bowery from the rest of the bloggerazzi. how was it, gals? what's the good word? i'm sure the boys did a fantastic job of rocking that supercalifragilisticespialidocious venue.
