          playing catchup through photos    i saw   the boggs  last show last night at bowery. it was great to see them on a big stage, and they really shined like the blues punk rockers they are... so sad that jason is moving to germany!     as you may or may not know, brad (drummer) has joined the   on!air!library!  lineup, and will rock on with those!ethereal!kids!     hopefully zeke will keep on with his slide guitar, because he's got mindblowing skillz. i hear his solo stuff is amazing -- hello, record labels!      dennis cahlo  has the voice made especially for soaring hearts that swoon for the hope of love gained and love lost. here he's playing at his residency at pianos. soft lighting, soft heart.     LUKE'S NEW EVENT POSTING SITE! POST YOUR SHOWS AND STUFF HERE!!      according to one boy,   mary timony  seems to be going through a cute phase.     according to several other boys,   mary timony  is  definitely  going through a cute "i love you, will you marry me?" phase.       hightower  plays the dennis cahlo residency at pianos, and looks good while singing his lovely songs...      the sleepy jackson  are not as sleepy as you'd think: "i love to watch good dancers talk. my heart is stronger than you all!" one guy kept making out with his gf on the roof of bar 13 in the freeeeezing cold. that's love, people.      q and not u  know how to be political and dancey at the same time. i liked it, and even found my feet (one of which i pulled the achilles tendon) dancing.   more to come:  the winter pageant. circle and square. au revoir simone. qatsi. autodrone. a place to bury strangers. hotbird 7. etc etc etc.
