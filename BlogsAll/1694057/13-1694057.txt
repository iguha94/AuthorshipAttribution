          december, baby    i could have gone to see the strokes/kings of leon show, probably hanging somewhere in VIP (through work, of course, not jinners) but my boys and my girl were playing a show at the mercury lounge, and like a good manager, i went and saw one of the coolest nights of rock i've seen in a long time, including cmj.      i am so so so very proud of    dirty on purpose   for pulling off a spectacular, amazing, wonderfully, exhilarating set last night, pulling in the second most people of the night, second only to the headliners,    the decemberists  . i have a major crush on colin meloy, who reminds me of colin firth. i want to travel to portland to see this band play again!! dirty on purpose did a fucking awesome, tear-jerking cover of "summer of 69", and i was totally floored.         earlimart   also blew me away with a robust, energetic performance that was both beautiful and whimsical.    pela   performed probably their most perfect set yet, playing all of my favorites! i can't believe that every band on the bill tonight was FUCKING AWESOME. it was a totally sold out event, packed to the brim on a wednesday night, days after cmj madness. how cool is that?
