          SXSW: march 16, tuesday night  So I'm addicted to listening to "all new friends" -- the fucking coolest song that is on repeat on my ipod.... Yes it is a dirty on purpose track but who fucking cares? Its one of those tracks that make u wanna jump up and sing.... And dance especially.... Excuse me if I'm using "interweb" language like "u" and lack of apostrophes. I'm a bit tipsy from too much free red wine tonight...   So far I have met some really cool people at sxsw.... And I'm totally loving it. Had a great dinner with some peeps including the cool kids from a place to bury strangers (tim, ollie, justin) and karen from violator -- a fucking depeche mode cover band! How fucking hawt is that?   Tomorrow I have a lot of shit to do for work but I plan on seeing ambulance ltd at the vice/jane party... The wrens and clearlake at the 33 degrees instore.... And ma' boys in the natural history at the fader levis party... and maybe charlie mars at the bmg new times bbq... And cass mccombs at the inland empire showcase and of course dresden dolls and a place to bury strangers at the ascap showcase....   I just came back from some film and tv party.... And the bar was called "maggie mae" .... Do u know that pietasters (?) song "maggie mae bring us another beer take away our trouble dear.... Uh neither did ANYONE in texas. What the hell didn't anyone listen to ska back in the day???
