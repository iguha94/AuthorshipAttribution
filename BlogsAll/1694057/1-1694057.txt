         from entertainment weekly:   Celebs plan ''Simpsons,'' ''King of the Hill'' cameos. Everyone from Brad Pitt to Tony Blair will appear   Brad Pitt apparently hasn't let the lackluster box-office for his ''Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas'' deter him from doing more cartoon voiceover work. He'll be leading a Texas-sized contingent of celebrities doing voice cameos next season for ''King of the Hill'' and ''The Simpsons,'' Fox announced Thursday.  Pitt will bring his pipes to ''King,'' as will Ben Stiller, Christina Applegate, Jamie Kennedy, Laura Dern, and Fred Willard. Several country stars will visit Arlen, Texas, for the Christmas episode, including Trace Adkins, Brad Paisley, George Strait, Deana Carter, and Travis Tritt. Other musicians slated to appear are Kiss' Gene Simmons and Texas' own Kelly Clarkson.  Over in Springfield, the 15th (!) season of ''The Simpsons'' opens with an episode featuring the return of Glenn Close as Homer's fugitive mom. Another returning parent: Jackie Mason, as the rabbi dad of Krusty the Clown. The Halloween ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode will feature Jennifer Garner, Jerry Lewis, and boxer Oscar De La Hoya. The already much-touted trip to England (in an episode called ''The Regina Monologues'') will include appearances by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Ian McKellen, J.K. Rowling, Jane Leeves (as Grandpa Simpson's old flame) and token Yank Evan Marriott (of ''Joe Millionaire''). Also visiting Springfield will be Simon Cowell, Mr. T, ''Bowling for Columbine'' director Michael Moore, and the late Robert Stack.
