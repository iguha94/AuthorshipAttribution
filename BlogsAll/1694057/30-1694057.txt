          cover me  yesterday was the night of covers in the basement of north six. it was dingy down there, and someone was sucking on tea tree oil toothpicks (mmm, minty fresh!) and some band was practicing very loudly in the rehearsal space. plus, the sound in the basement was terrible, but we were all there to support and have some fun...  first    the debutantes  , a gothy raveonettes in stereo, sang the go-gos "our lips are sealed." their own songs were cute and spunky. the lead singer definitely had a belinda carlisle-esque voice that was nice to listen to. they had two guitars and drums and were rocking out. some of their songs kind of sounded the same, but i think this band is still evolving nicely...   then    kudzu wish  , a les savy fav-ish group from athens, ga, sang "web in front" by archers of loaf. god how i love that song.  "all i ever wanted was to be your spine!"  the lead singer hung by his feet from the rafters (very tim harrington, eh?). then he fell off and landed on his head!! that has gotta hurt. yow. also this band used a cowbell in one of their songs!    '64 World's Fair , composed of annie and sung bin with doug dop sitting in on drums, covered the pixies' "gigantic." because the sound was so bad, i couldn't hear the vocals too well but i know they sang songs about how beer is better than soda and thomas the tank engine. yeah!! i was so tired and didn't stay for the last band,   " target="new"> the winter pageant  , but i hear they are good. will catch them next time!
