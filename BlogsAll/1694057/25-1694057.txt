         while going to see qatsi play last night at pianos, i saw another pretty amazing band called    read yellow  . they were throbbing noisy punk rock with lots of sharp guitar licks and hard drum kicks. they are from amherst, mass., and i think they're gonna blow up, considering their next couple shows are with mission of burma and radio 4 -- a pretty impressive move, though i'm not sure their music gels with those bands -- they're much harder. listen for yourself:   "the association"  and   "fashion fatale"      qatsi   also brought the house down last night. i'm pretty sure dave was playing guitar between some girl's legs at one point. they always bring something a little new to their performance. those guys are awesome. if you haven't heard them, here's a song:   "City Son"   and i wish i could go to sleep tonight, but there is so much going on!! if anyone is around the east village, they should stop by lit and see  turing machine  -- it will be their last show for quite a while as their bassist is going abroad for a while. justin will be pulling double duty as he will rock and sweat in both  panthers  and  turing machine . that guy is a maniac! oh yeah, there's open bar from 9 to 10.
