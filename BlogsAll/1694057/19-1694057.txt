               margaret cho   looked so hot last night. she wore this icecapades-like outfit that was brilliant, sparkling white. she looked so happy. this is her third touring comedy show, and i was happy to be seeing it. i've seen all of them live, starting from "i'm the one that i want" to "notorious c.h.o." and now to "revolution cho." her act has gotten considerably more political and socially conscious, which explains the show name. she talks about social inequalities, racism, crazy recent political events (aka gov. arnold).   she focuses less on the gory sexual details, which was prevalent in "notorious," and more on how we all can start a revolution by recognizing the silly, "sacred" traditions we all have come to accept as normal. marriage does not have to be sacred between just a man and woman. the government shouldn't have to ask you to die for your country, but tell you not to talk about being gay. and my favorite is when people ask you what kind of asian you are ("i can't tell any of you apart!"). marg cho: "uh, why do you have to tell us apart? are we going to be separated and put in internment camps?" i couldn't stop laughing when she said that. it's so true! why DO people have to tell us apart? not even  we  can tell us apart!  she had so many new jokes and interesting perspectives to add to "revolution," which made me happy because a lot of the material in her first two shows overlapped. "revolution" was packed with lots of new material that talks about her more current life experiences, and it's good to see that she's living in the past less and less and enjoying her present more and more.   go,  margaret cho !  her opening act, bruce daniels, was pretty funny too. he talked a lot about the same types of issues -- racism, social inequalities, stereotypes...  marg and bruce and some other chick (can't remember her name) did a rap at the end that wasn't very good, but i had to give her props on her effort. mc mc!
