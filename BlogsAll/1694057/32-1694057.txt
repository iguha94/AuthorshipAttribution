          aw shucks  so much has been going on the past few weeks that i feel like i haven't had a chance to breathe. i took today off from work to do just that. breathe. i guess today is my day to get my shit together a little. the holidays are such a drain. work has been crazy as well, but i like that better than having downtime. if you haven't noticed, i like to keep busy.   this time of year is also a time for reflection and correction. that whole new year's resolution. i always make one or two or three, and then sometime in the middle of the year, i forget i made any. typical.   there are certain things i'd love to accomplish: build a higher tolerance to alochol so i'm not puking in some restaurant on the steps like a crazy person. hmmm, that'd be lovely.   other things i'd like to accomplish: meet colin firth and fall madly in love and he'd leave his wife and his kids for  me ... oh wait, wife and kids? scratch that. alimony is a bitch.  another accomplishing thought: read more books on the subway coming home from a rock show when i'm either tired or buzzed or both... oh wait, lately i've been terribly wasteful and taking cabs back to wburg, so nevermind. maybe i should try to stop doing that and instead invest said money to smoke more cigarettes.  sounds like i'm going to have to think more about this.
