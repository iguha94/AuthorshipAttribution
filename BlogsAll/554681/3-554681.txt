         SHINE ON , NEW YORK!  BY NAOMI RAGEN   AS THE MEMORIAL FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE TERRORIST  ATTACK ON NEW YORK FILL THE AIRWAVES OF ISRAEL, THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY  FROM THE CITY OF MY BIRTH, I HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE  TERRORISTS CHOSE THE CITY OF NEW YORK FOR THE SICKENING EXPRESSION OF THEIR  DEGENERATE  AGENDA AGAINST ALL FREE PEOPLE.  IT IS BECAUSE THE  SPIRIT OF  NEW YORK CITY REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THAT THEY, AND THE RUTHLESS  DICTATORS OF SLAVE STATES IN THE MIDDLE EAST WHO SUPPORT THEM, ARE  TRYING TO DESTROY.  NEW YORK CITY IS A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE CAN HAVE  AN EDUCATION, AND CAN CHOOSE ANY PROFESSION.  FOR FIFTY DOLLARS A  SEMESTER, I, AND MILLIONS OF OTHERS WHO COULD NEVER AFFORD A COLLEGE  EDUCATION,  WENT THROUGH THE CORRIDORS OF THE CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK,  LEARNING ABOUT MUSIC AND ART AND HISTORY AND CULTURE AND LITERATURE AND  BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY...  NEW YORK CITY IS A PLACE WHERE IT DOESN’T MATTER  WHO YOUR PARENTS ARE, HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE, WHAT  FAITH THEY  PROFESS, WHAT COLOR THEY WERE BORN.  YOU CAN STILL BE A FAMOUS ARTIST, A  WRITER, A DANCER, A SCHOLAR.. YOU CAN ASPIRE TO BE ANYTHING YOU CAN DREAM.  NEW YORK CITY IS A PLACE WHERE THE ARTS FLOURISH.   WHERE ANY IDEA  IS TOLERATED AND EXPLORED.  WHERE MEN AND WOMEN ARE  FREE TO WATCH AND READ AND BELIEVE OR REJECT ANY PHILOSOPHY, ANY IDEA  ANY BOOK, ANY MAGAZINE.  NEW YORK CITY IS A PLACE WHERE WOMEN ARE IN  CONTROL OF THEIR BODIES AND THEIR FUTURES AND THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR CHOICES.   A PLACE WHERE NO MAN CAN MURDER HIS DAUGHTER, ABUSE HIS WIFE,  SLAUGHTER HIS SISTER BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT CONFORM TO HIS IDEAS OF HOW TO ACT,  OR THINK, OR DRESS.  NEW YORK CITY IS A PLACE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY,  WHERE SMALL WORKSHOPS AND TINY FACTORIES, AND LITTLE FRINGE THEATRE  GROUPS, AND CORNERSHOP BAKERIES FLOURISH.  WHERE EVERY MAN AND WOMAN CAN  PURSUE A DREAM, AND CANNOT BE  DESTROYED BY NEPOTISM AND CORRUPT  POLITICIANS AND WAR LORDS AND DICTATORS.  NEW YORK CITY IS A PLACE WHERE ELECTIONS TAKE  PLACE AND MEN AND WOMEN GO TO MEETINGS, MARCH  IN THE STREET, PRINT  BROCHURES, KNOCK ON DOORS, AND SAY OUT LOUD ANYTHING THEY WANT.  THEY CAN VOTE  IN ABSOLUTE SECRECY FOR LEADERS, AND THESE LEADERS CAN BE VOTED OUT IF  THEY DISPLEASE THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR THEM.   IT’S A PLACE  WHERE VOTES  ARE COUNTED FAIRLY,AND BALLOT BOXES ARE NOT STUFFED AND CANDIDATES ARE  NOT MURDERED, AND EVERY MAN OR WOMAN WHO WISHES TO OFFER HIMSELF AS A  LEADER WILL BE HEARD.  NEW YORK CITY IS OPEN TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD  OF EVERY NATIONALITY, RELIGION AND COLOR.  BOATS AND PLANES  FILLED  WITH IMMIGRANTS SEEKING REFUGE ARE WELCOMED.  VERY FEW NEW YORKERS CAN  SAY THAT THEY AND THEIR PARENTS LIVED THERE FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS.  IT IS  A CITY OF NEWCOMERS, ALL WELCOME, ALL TREATED EQUALLY.  NEW YORK CITY REPRESENTS THE BEST OF WHAT AMERICA  HAS TO OFFER, THE BEST IN A WORLD OVERRUN BY HATE-MONGERS, DICTATORS,  NEPOTISTS, THEIVES AND STRONG MEN, WHO DEPRIVE MEN AND WOMEN OF THEIR  RIGHT TO LIFE, TO LIBERTY AND TO THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.  YOU, WHO HAVE BRUISED OUR CITY, AND TAKEN A PIECE  OF ITS HEART AND TRAMPLED IT, KNOW THAT YOU WILL NEVER DEFEAT IT ,  BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN DEFEATING ALL THAT IS GOOD IN THE WORLD.   YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING OUT  THOUSANDS OF LIGHTS .   BUT MILLIONS  MORE WILL CONTINUE TO SHINE THROUGH THE HORRIBLE BLACK HELL YOU CREATED  WITH YOUR SICK  IDEAS AND BRUTAL ACTS OF BARBARISM.  SHINE ON NEW YORK.  SHINE ON, THE LIGHTS OF BROADWAY AND LINCOLN  CENTER AND THE METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE AND CARNEGIE HALL AND THE EMPIRE  STATE BUILDING AND MACY’S AND THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, AND THE  METROPOLITAN MUSEUM AND THE FORTY-SECOND STREET LIBRARY, THE SKYLINE, THE  BRIDGES, THE GREAT HOTELS OFF CENTRAL PARK, THE SKATERS OF ROCKEFELLER  CENTER.  NEVER FORGET YOUR LIGHT WARMS THE LIVES OF GOOD  PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD WHO STRIVE TO LIVE PEACEFUL, CREATIVE,  PRODUCTIVE LIVES, FREE OF HATRED.  NEVER FORGET THAT YOUR ENEMIES HATE YOU  FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT YOU BECAME, AND REMAIN, THE GREATEST CITY IN  THE WORLD.  WITH ALL MY LOVE,  NAOMI RAGEN (BORN IN THE BROOKLYN  JEWISH HOSPITAL, EDUCATED  IN BROOKLYN COLLEGE, THEATER-GOER, MUSIC LOVER, NATIVE DAUGHTER
