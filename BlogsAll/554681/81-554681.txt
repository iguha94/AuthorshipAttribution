         FIRST REVIEW   HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX   By JUSTIN PENROSE   A CHILDLIKE feeling of excitement ran through me as I opened the book the world has waited two years to see.   Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has all the magic which makes the series a phenomenon — JK Rowling does not disappoint.    Scary, exhilarating, funny and tear-jerking, she has crafted a beautiful masterpiece that will cast a spell over kids of all ages. Even a 28-year-old dad of two.   At 776 pages, you could be forgiven for thinking Harry’s adventures are drawn out.   But by the end of the first chapter you are in no doubt this is a blockbuster of a book.   And at the start of the second, JK drops her first bombshell.   Wiz kid ... Harry is back  The darker plot than we’re used to twists and turns like a Slytherin snake, while shocks hit the reader like a muggle seeing a flying car in the sky.   Order of the Phoenix will make you laugh, it will make you cry.   Above all it will make you yearn for Rowling’s next instalment.   The master magician is back.   Unfortunately, there are still 46 days to wait before you too can be taken back to the land of Hogwarts.
