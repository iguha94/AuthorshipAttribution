          Shamus Award Nominees Announced   The Private Eye Writers of America (PWA) is proud to announce its nominees for the 2003 Shamus Awards.  Books and short stories first published in 2002 were eligible for consideration.  In each work the main character must be a person paid for investigative work but not employed by a unit of government.  Thus books and stories about private investigators (licensed and unlicensed), lawyers and reporters who do their own legwork, and other hired agents are eligible; works centering on law enforcement officers or amateur sleuths are not.  The Shamus Awards will be presented in October at the PWA banquet to be held in Las Vegas, Nevada, during Bouchercon, the World Mystery Convention.   The nominees are:    Best P.I.
