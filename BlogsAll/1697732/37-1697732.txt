Stood up.  By a goddamn   25-year-old .  No biggie, though; I expected as much 'cause he hadn't returned my emails in almost a week.  And he never gave me his number.  Kids these days ...  So when Rick called this morning with free tickets to a show tonight, I said yes -- I had a pretty good feeling I'd have my night free anyway.  And the evening was a blast.  To start off, I got rock-star parking half a block from the theater.  Then we had dinner at my favorite   restaurant .  Then we saw    Straight Up with a Twist   -- Paul Stroili's fabulously hilarious one-man show about his lonely life growing up as a gay heterosexual.  The show has been around much longer than the term  metrosexual , and Paul (I call him Paul) even included a bit about the difference between metrosexuals (straight men who wear their hearts on their sleeves) and what he calls himself: a renaissance geek (a straight man who makes sure that sleeve is  ironed ).    The best part was the game show that involved two hapless audience members getting called up on stage to answer questions only a renaissance geek would know.  And guess who Paul singled out from the entire audience?  And guess who won by knowing you should never wear a double-breasted jacket unbuttoned?  (Actually, IMHO, you should never wear a double-breasted jacket  period  -- but then again, I don't have my own one-man show.)
