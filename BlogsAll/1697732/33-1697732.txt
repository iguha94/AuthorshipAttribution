I did a bad thing.   I told M. about my blog.  When I started this blog, I made a mental note not to tell two groups of people about it: my family (because sometimes I talk about  s-e-x ) and the men I think I might go on dates with (because you  have  to dish about your dates on your blog).  But I wanted to impress M. with my breezy, conversational writing style and the effortless flair that punctuates all my posts -- so I told him about it in those first few emails after we met on Monday night.  And he clearly read it right away, because he talked about my writing and the content of my Salon   profile  in the very next email he sent me.  (Which, when I think about it, shows a certain level of interest on his part, no?)  Anyway, now I can't gush on and on about how much fun we had on our date tonight.  Or how cute he gets when he talks about  Hamlet . Or how nice his butt feels when my hands wander south as we kiss.  'Cause he might read all about it ... and it's probably kind of creepy to see your delightful evening analyzed on a blog posted for all the world to see.  So if you are M., stop reading right now.   Speaking of all the world, I have no idea if  anyone  outside my immediate circle of friends reads this.  But if you do read this and I don't know you, I have one thing to say:  Hi!  (And I had a date tonight with this really cute guy and we had a great time.)
