Keith and I spent yesterday shopping and eating and just hanging out in Boystown, and then we capped off our day with a showing of    The Company  , which we really loved.  In addition to Altman's brilliant restraint in letting the story tell itself, the focus on some of my favorite Joffrey dancers and the casting of a bunch of Chicago actors I recognized -- including the woman I saw so brilliantly play Desir√©e Armfeldt in    A Little Night Music   just two nights earlier -- I think I got the biggest kick out of seeing an endless parade of Chicago locations I recognized in this movie.  It's cool that after only three years here I feel such a sense of ownership and belonging in Chicago -- and that I've gotten to know the city so well I can pinpoint location shots in movies, commercials and TV shows.  This morning, after a leisurely reading of the paper over orange juice, toast and big-band jazz, Keith headed off to the airport and I headed to the laundry room for some long-overdue sartorial cleansing (six loads!). A cute guy I've never seen before in the building tried to chat me up in front of the dryers, but I had my Crest Whitestrips in, so I couldn't make charming, flirtatious conversation ... and he eventually wandered off.  Sigh.  But while my clothes were sloshing and spinning their way to cleanliness, I rotated my mattress (only 18 days behind on my strict three-month rotation regimen) and did naughty things with my credit cards on amazon.com.  Within the week, I should be getting a huge shipment of DVDs including  Finding Nemo  and  Bedknobs and Broomsticks  and cast albums including    Hairspray  ,  Little Shop of Horrors ,  Urinetown ,  Wicked  and  Avenue Q .  (Some picker/packer in some Amazon warehouse is probably making fag jokes as we speak.)
