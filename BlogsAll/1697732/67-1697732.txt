Continuing on yesterday's hot-man theme, I got a pleasant surprise today out of something I thought would be a huge imposition.    See, I was assigned to be a welcome buddy to a new copywriter who started today at work.  Normally, being a welcome buddy is pretty fun -- you get to be the all-knowing hero who shows the new employee around the office, gives him or her the lowdown on the cool and not-so-cool co-workers, explains the intricacies of our labyrinthine billing software, takes him or her to lunch, and stuff like that.  But we're five months into a crisis-level copywriter deficit, and every minute of my day is as precious and special as an original thought in George Bush's head.  So I was NOT looking forward to sacrificing a couple hours of productivity (which I'd have no choice but to make up well into the night) to schlep some new guy from office to office and cube to cube and show him where the bathrooms are and where to get extra pencils.  Then I met him.  WOOF.  Tall and dreamy and gangly in a cute-but-non-threatening-boy-next-door kind of way, his looks alone made introducing him to our co-workers as fun as passing off a rented porn star as my boyfriend at a big party filled with easily jealous friends.  And so far, he's been NICE and FUNNY and GREGARIOUS -- but of course it's his first day so he's probably on his best behavior.  Inevitably, one of our first conversations involved the words "my ex-girlfriend" -- and they didn't come out of MY mouth.  But I'm contractually obligated to remain single anyway.  I'm just happy that we finally have some hot man-meat in the office to make our days more visually appealing.
