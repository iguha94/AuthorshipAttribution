The   chorus  sang tonight at an induction ceremony for the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.  The event was held in a smallish ballroom in the beautiful beaux-arts Chicago Cultural Center, which I've always wanted to check out.  And I wasn't disappointed.  What an amazing building!  Apparently the hall of fame thing tonight was a Big Deal.  The press were there.  The mayor was there.  And so was Ian, a member of a tight-knit group of friends that adopted me when I moved here three years ago and apparently divorced me last year.  I hadn't heard from or seen any of them since an awkward bump-into-on-the-sidewalk encounter early this spring -- so it was especially ironic that when I got home tonight there was a letter in my mailbox from my mortgage broker with a $50 gift card to thank me for referring Dan, another member of that group, to him.  Water under the bridge.  I lose some friends I never really felt comfortable around, I get a $50 dinner courtesy of my mortgage broker, I get to sing in front of a roomful of homos.  Everybody wins!  Anyway, in between Ian and Dan I got a surprise mini-date with the ultra-dreamy and always-fun Scott.  He and I ended up standing next to each other on stage tonight, and after the concert we decided to hit the big sale at Field's -- where I got two kick-ass new shirts and a funky pair of jeans -- and then grab dinner at Potbelly's.  Then we sat by each other on the train with our legs pressed tightly against each other.  A quick peck on the lips at his stop, though, and it was all over.  Sigh.  Now I just have to decide which shirt to wear to work tomorrow.
