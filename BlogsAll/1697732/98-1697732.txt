Another chance to run along the lakefront and enjoy the last fading blooms and faint perfumes of the lilac trees.  (Wow.  That was almost poetic.)  And another six miles.   Oy.   I could NOT keep my pace up tonight.  And I think it was because I ate a lot of crap at work today (new employees and big-wig client meetings = lots of tempting doughnuts floating around the office) and because I didn't eat enough of  anything  before I took off running.  I'm also becoming very bored (and  very  frustrated) with my inner dialogue.  No matter what I try to stick in my head as I run -- be it a song or the conversation I imagine I'll have someday when I find myself sitting next to Oprah or Ted Allen on the 147 bus -- my mind invariably wanders and I find myself running inexplicably to an endless loop of the bridge from Billy Joel's "Pressure":   All [run] grown [run] up [run] and [run] no place to go  [run] [run] [run] [run] Psych [run] 1 [run] Psych [run] 2 [run]  What do you know?  [run] [run] [run] [run]  All [run] your [run] life [run] is [run]  channel 13  [run] [run] [run] [run]  Sesame Street  [run] [run] [run] [run]  What does it mean?  [run] [run] [run] [run]   You can see how frustrating it can get.    And I'm not bashing Billy Joel or even "Pressure."  It's just that I've been running -- unintentionally, I repeat -- with that song in my head for 10 years now.  Maybe if I train myself to run faster than my well-entrenched 9-minute-mile pace I can upgrade to something faster.  Like "Uptown Girl."  (Note to self: The Polo Ralph Lauren tighty-whities are too old and waaaaaaay too small after repeated shrinkings in the dryer to be worn running.)
