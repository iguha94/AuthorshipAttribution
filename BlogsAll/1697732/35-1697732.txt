So the weekend guests have come and gone, and I'm  exhausted .     The Producers   was fun on Friday night, but not as amazing as I'd expected.  And our last-minute seats were in the very back row of the upper balcony -- where you just can't look rich and connected no matter how much DKNY you have on.   Saturday was all about shopping and eating, and I waddled home at the end of the day with three new shirts, two new pair of shoes and a new pair of jeans.  The jeans are those intentionally-dirty-looking things I've been hating since they first started appearing on hipsters half my age a couple years ago.  And suddenly I'm wearing them.  (But they look fabulous with my new Skechers!)  I'm such a goddamn lemming.  After shopping all day Saturday with Mom, Kay and Mary, I abandoned them at 6 to entertain my metrosexual cousin Chris, who was in town for a conference.  We shopped on north Michigan Avenue for a while and then headed up to Boystown for a fabulous dinner among the cultural cognoscenti at   Ping Pong .  He had an early flight home the next morning, so after dropping him off at his hotel I headed over to a fabulous little cocktail soiree at Matthew's Gold Coast condo.  And by the time I tumbled into bed, I was one tired puppy.  Sunday morning Mom, Kay, Mary and I had brunch with Pat, Dana and Rob -- even more Iowa-based friends who were visiting Chicago this weekend.  After a couple hours of catching up, everyone hit the road for home and I hit the laundry room and choreographed some more disco to teach at   chorus  rehearsal last night.  Now I'm at work avoiding my professional obligations and looking all trendy and shit in my new threads.  Dig me!
