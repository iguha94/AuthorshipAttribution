A cold weekend in Chicago.   It's too damn cold here to lie around inert, so I'm keeping myself busy and my blood circulating:  - Keith and I signed up for   French lessons  yesterday.  Neither of us has studied French, but we have proficiency in German and Spanish, respectively.  Our language-learning prowess notwithstanding, the hottie at the Alliance Fran√ßaise  insisted  that we start with the pre-beginner class.  So I guess we'll spend the next 10 weeks mastering our vowel sounds and numbers and days of the week. - I made the long, ugly trek to Menards and Home Depot yesterday to return all the unused stuff from my hallway-painting-and-light-switch-replacing project.  Driving all the way down to the traffic-clogged North and Clybourn area is always such a treat. - Matt and I enjoyed a taste of   suburban chain food  for dinner last night on our way to Chuck's housewarming party in East Rogers Park, where we chatted and gossiped and flirted with people until 2 in the morning. - I currently have nine articles of rarely-worn winter clothing in my giveaway pile.  I vow to take that number to 20 before I drop everything off at the   Brown Elephant  on my way to tonight's   chorus  rehearsal. - And I have to be in bed early tonight; I take off at 6:30 tomorrow morning for a whirlwind trip to New York City where I'll get to observe five hours of focus groups.  Whee!
