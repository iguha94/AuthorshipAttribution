When Step Groove goes bad.   So Anders and I decided to take a step aerobics class after work tonight.  And though I haven't taken a class in a couple years, I've logged more hours in aerobics classes over my life than most Republicans have spent convincing themselves that "hate the sin, love the sinner" is a logical way to think.  So I was kind of excited to get back into the groove, as it were.  By the time Anders and I got there, the class was so full there were only a couple spots left for our step benches: way in the front or way in the back.  I was tempted to take a prominent spot in the front because, hey, I've taken tons of classes before.  And hey, I'm a dancer.  Hell -- right now, I'm a  choreographer .  I can rock no matter where I stand in class.  Right?  For some reason, we decided to stay in the back.  And about five minutes into class, I was profoundly thankful.  First of all, it's a pretty advanced class, so the combinations came at us quickly and complicatedly.  And second, the class is full of regulars who already know the combinations -- or at least the instructor's basic vocabulary.    So for about 15 minutes I kept up.  And then my brain reached critical absorption.  And  then  my crappy new deodorant gave out.  So for the last 35 minutes or so I was that stinky clueless guy who just takes up valuable space on the gym floor.  But a little humiliation now and then can keep you grounded.  I am, however, going to head to   Sidetrack  tonight so I can belt out show tunes loudly and clearly so everyone can admire how I know all the words.  And most of the harmonies.
