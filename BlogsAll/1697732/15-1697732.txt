I suck at this game.  So I go to the EL last night and I walk past a hunky (though young-looking) dude sitting in a sleeveless T-shirt and baggy gym shorts on the platform.  He doesn't even look up, so I keep on walking and I wait for the train at the other end of the platform.  The train comes, I get on, I sit down, I start reading ... and I suddenly notice he's sitting right across the aisle from me.  Which means either: 1) He randomly wandered to the same train I'm on and my imagination's just in overdrive. 2) He followed me 'cause he wants me BAD.  And it definitely means: 1) He's fucking HOT up close.  Then both of us keep "looking" around the train, craning our necks this way and that in a shameless effort to just happen to lock eyes once in a while.  Which we do.  A lot.  Then we get to the part where I have no idea what to say or do.  "Excuse me, but I noticed we seem to be flirting. Wanna see my cock?"  "Dude.  Nice legs.  They'd look great wrapped around my neck."  "Man, it's  hot  in here.  Mind if I take off my shirt?"  The possibilities are endless ... if you're doing bad porn.  Anyway, we get to my stop.  He's momentarily distracted by his book.  I get off.  He doesn't notice until the doors close and the train starts pulling away and our eyes meet once more through the window.  And I lose yet another chance to either: 1) Get harassed for being a fag. 2) Bang a really hot guy.
