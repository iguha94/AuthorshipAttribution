Bob and I have acquired an expensive little habit: way-too-frequent dinner-and-theater outings.  But they're fun!  This season's crop of theater started last night with a spectacular Joffrey production of John Cranko's 1962  Romeo & Juliet  set to Sergei Prokofiev's lush post-Romantic score.  I'm a huge Joffrey fan, but lately the company has seemed unpolished and downright wobbly in performance.  In fact, I switched my ballet-company allegience to the Hubbard Street Dance Company after seeing its mind-blowing spring repertory concert this year, but after last night I'm squarely back in the Joffrey camp.  I had never seen Cranko's setting of  R&J  (actually, I don't even recall ever hearing Prokofiev's score) -- and I can't remember ever seeing the Joffrey perform in Chicago to a live orchestra -- so the evening was a pretty amazing experience.  Cranko's narrative is strong and broad and manifests a deep understanding of both classical ballet's idealism and modern dance's iconoclasm. The Joffery's set for the production is magnificent -- and versatile enough to frame every scene in the ballet with just a few lighting and prop changes.  And (I'm going to sound like a big old theater queen here) the sumptuous costumes -- especially at the Capulets' ball -- caused audible gasps in the audience.  And the dancing.  Wow.  It was exuberant, poignant, thoughtful, moving ... and still fresh and interesting 40 years after it was created.  And I would be gravely remiss if I didn't make special mention of the ass on the   dancer who played Mercutio .  Sigh.  It's enough to get me back on the squat rack at the gym.  To counterbalance the overpowering stench of homosexual rapture, the house manager gave Cubs/Marlins scores at both intermissions last night -- and since the Cubs spent their entire game kicking the Marlins' collective ass, everyone in our audience cheered.   Quel butch!
