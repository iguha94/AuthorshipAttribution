My sinus headaches finally reached the so-painful-I-could-vomit point, so I trudged off to the doctor yesterday afternoon for some nice drugs.  While I was there, I also got a 100,000-mile checkup and some apparently long-overdue inoculations.  After getting poked full of inactive viruses and shedding about four gallons of blood, I tottered off to my friendly neighborhood pharmacy and then home to recuperate.  And since the only way to escape from the workplace we like to call Mismanagementland at an even remotely decent hour is to schedule an afternoon doctor appointment, I magically had my night free.   And since I knew I'd have an opening in my personal life, I had scheduled a date with a charming and dangerously adorable man I met on   Friendster .  My sinus drugs kicked in rather quickly, so I was able to enjoy our dinner and long conversation as long as I remained mostly vertical.  But to compound my pains from needles and throbbing head regions, I was also feeling the effects of Wednesday's late-night appointment with a personal trainer who KICKED MY ASS (we get one free session a year at my gym -- and it took three months to schedule my session for 2004).  So by the end of the night I was full of holes, weary from vaccines and inhalable steroids, struggling to move every muscle in my torso, and a little giddy from chatting up a beautiful blond.  It was awesome!
