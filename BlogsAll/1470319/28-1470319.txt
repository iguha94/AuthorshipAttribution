Ok- quick post while I get ready for a conference call.  Things are alright here. I'm just you know, a little fed up in the work world. However, I had one interview last week (I thought it went well- but I haven't heard from them) and I have one next week in Castleton. At least I have a job I guess- but I'm obviously not happy here.   I did meet a really cool guy though. I think you guys have seen me post a little about Marshall on here- and he and I have started dating (who'd of thunk it- me with a red head). Ok girls- you've known me a long time- usually I go for the shorter, dark complexion, dark eyes- etc. He's 6'1", red hair and blue eyes w/ goatee. Jen and John have met him - and approve. He's a sweetie. He's 27, went to Ball State- is currently working at SBC but wants to go to film school. Cara- you would love this one book he did of photographs- he took B&W pics of himself and friends in this one setting- and has an alter-ego superhero (Kid Electro)- he wrote a mini-comic book. It was pretty cool. He says he's going to get me addicted to Sims, but we'll see. He says it's the gateway drug for gaming.  I've gone over 37,000 miles on my car...yeah..it's not even a year old....bastards.  Other than that- things are pretty sweet.    I think we should plan a big cookout sometime soon- maybe on the Northwest side of Indy to try to be as fair as we can be to everyone involved. (Steph, then again- no matter where you go (if you go) it would be far).
