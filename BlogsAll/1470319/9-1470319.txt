What I'm wondering is: where are the other posts? Can we start other blogs within this or is it just one consecutive thing? Damn I feel like an idiot! :)  Job Update: My Director of Marketing has been in town the last few days for our operations review- and he and I had a 2 hour talk this afternoon about me, my job, my performance and my future goals. I told him that I like my job but that I was concerned b/c there isn't anywhere up for me to go in this area. So he said that he would love to have me as part of the Corporate Marketing Team- and would I ever consider moving to Philly. So I thought about this- ok, I'm single, no kids- no family here ('cept you guys). I told him that if it was the right position, right money and right time that I would definitely consider it. There isn't an open position now- but if something comes available, he wants to talk to me about it.   School Update: Graduation was SO long (right Jen?) but it was worth it. I'm glad I went- but if I go back for my MBA ever, I will NOT go through the ceremony again.  Cara- happy about you getting a kitten, that's exciting!!! I think Marla is a cute name. Speaking of the nasty underwear, that's like Men and their jeans- WHAT THE HELL do they do in them that they ALWAYS wear them out and have holes in the crotch? I can have jeans for YEARS and they don't get holes unless I purposefully put them there.  ADD CHRIS!! He'll be the Spicy-Chicago-Slice-O-Pie that this Blog needs!  Cara/Steph- glad to see you joined, I was starting to wonder about you!! :)  Note about Jenny D: at 12 kids- doesn't she have to have a license??? I'm telling you- she's going to end up on the evening news- sooner than later.  Ok- I'm so exhausted, gotta go to bed (and yes, it's not even 9pm yet!)  ***hugs***
