Things are pretty much the same around here. I opened my big mouth and offered to help Liza with Kerrie's wedding shower, thinking that I would maybe help with food or decorations or something. NO, I have to call Kerrie and get how many people she wants to invite, the names and the addresses so that Liza can send out the invites. All b/c Liza feels that she doesn't have anything in common with Kerrie. This is totally going to be the way things are for the rest of our lives. Liza won't interact much with Kerrie and Kerrie is too intimidated by Liza so I will be caught in the middle b/c I can interact well with both. Oh well. John and I are starting to pack so that we can move to Whiteland. Never thought I would see the day where I would be excited about moving back to Whiteland.   Cara-I think that the name Marla is cute. How was the high society dinner? Did you break out the jewels and the furs?  Em-I will miss you if you leave but that is a great opportunity if it works out. Go Em! Just don't get your Dir. Of Mktg anymore speeding tickets! :)  Karissa-How are things down under in the library? Good I hope! We should definately add Chris. We could always use a little Chicago flavor.  Steph-Hope things for you and Adam are good. I'll check out that website later. If you are installing pagemaker on your computer you should check out Quark. It is a better version of pagemaker and you can do a lot of stuff with it.   I gotta to back to my crazy office. We are in the process of moving to a new building tomorrow and I need to pack 'em up and move 'em out!  Jen
