What's the website?  I may have to go and validate my obsessive Friends knowledge.  I never want to wax my eyebrows.  If they get too bad, I'll just shave them...;)  I was doing the lower body workout tape on my balance ball last night and I fell off.  Twice.  Once each way so now my elbows have matching rug burns.  It wouldn't be so bad but I keep forgetting and either leaning on things or bumping against stuff like I always do and getting an extra reminder that sometimes my balance really sucks, especially when I'm trying to balance on an inflatible sphere.  You know, that thing gets tipping and there's just nothing you can do to stop it.  You learn to take a fall really fast.  It wouldn't be so bad but I got the biggest balance ball and it's just too tall for me to really sit on.  I have to get the smaller one so I don't kill myself when I take a head dive into the couch.  But one really good thing about this balance ball thing is that I have to vacuum my living room before I can do the tape so I don't get completely covered in cat hair, so my floor is much cleaner than usual.  Thinking of cleaning, what is everybody doing over the long weekend?  I'm going up with my folks to see the kids in Chicago.  We were going to stay in a hotel so we'd have pool access for the kids but Dad really likes their morning time with Jake and Maggie.  It helps Steph and Joel get a little more sleep and the kids get the grandparents all to themselves.  Happiness all around!  And I get to sleep on an air mattress, and that's always fun. :)  Ok, I've been working on this list for a while and I think I've got it figured out.  I'm not ready to laminate, either, but it's a work in progress.  So, for right now, here goes.  1.)  Heath Ledger 2.)  Cuba Gooding, Jr. 3.)  Owen Wilson 4.)  Jason Lee 5.)  Ewan MacGregor  I just know that someone is going to list someone else and I'm going to say, yeah, I want them on my list, too!  :)
