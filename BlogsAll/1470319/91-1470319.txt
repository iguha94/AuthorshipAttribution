Chris...I love the fact that you married Elizabeth 3 times. It's the sweetest thing I've ever heard. Weddings are stressful enough and you know you really love that person when you're willing to do it ALL over again. I bet you won't be renewing your vows for awhile though. I know Bob wouldn't marry me for a second time.  Bob called after the Orkin Man left. He gave me two choices: A hole in the wall of our basement or a hole in the floor right next to the stairs. I chose the wall. I guess they need it big enough that a guy can regularly check for termites. I guess this is something we will always have to struggle with. There are other things that we have to do, like replace some basement windows and tear out all the shrubs that are next to the house. He also recommended tearing out the original floor. It makes me sick to spend so much money and just get laminate floors after having real hardwood. But we just can't afford the real stuff right now. Plus if we ever have kids, we're going to be screaming at them everytime they make a dent or mark.  Bob's friends want to go to Disney World next year for vacation. 6 adults and 5 kids in one condo. I told Bob there was no way in hell that I was going. It does not sound like fun to me at all. I don't know how I'm going to tell them that I don't wanna go.
