Well Miss Karissa, almost right on cue! I just concluded my informal offer on the phone with one, Mr. Richard Lewis (the attractive  Brit with the BAD teeth). They are waiting for a few callbacks from references to be able to complete the formal offer. But they want to fax it to me tomorrow (yes, at work- Yikes).  I'm slightly disappointed because they offered me a little less than I was hoping...however...I can make a bonus at the end of the year for $2500 which makes up for it. And I can look at that as sort of a savings plan. Which I've decided I have to get better at anyway....the car...as beautiful as it is- was a BAD purchase. I can't sell it now- because I'll be completely upside down with it- but I've got to try to see if I can refinance in any way to lower my payments. Emily had a near meltdown last night due to money-stressors...not good. And with such less stress than what I'm dealing with now- it's worth a little less money too. And I can get a promotion in about 6 months (I'll work hard to move that forward).  'Rissa- can't wait to see the hair- I'd say lets do lunch today- but I'm broke as a joke until Friday (and that's still pushing it!). I don't think I'm going to give my notice until Thursday- that way they'll still pay me- maybe Wednesday.   Anyway- though I'm disappointed that I won't be a millionaire before I'm 30 (no, I didn't really think I would be)- I'm very happy about the job.....so.....onward and upward..right? ;)
