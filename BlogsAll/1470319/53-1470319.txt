Nothing much new going here in Whitey-land. Just wanted to let everyone know that John and I are doing well.  FYI-Pee does work and not just for Friends. We rented the Real Cancun the other night (don't ask me why, maybe we were bored I think John wanted to see boobies but he won't admit to it) and one of the drunk girls got stung on her leg when she was bungie jumping. A medic came and asked her to pee on herself. She couldn't much like Monica so one of the drunk boys peed in a cup and poured it on her leg.   Love the color choice Em. We may postpone the wedding not because of any problems other than we have some money saved but his family isn't going to help much so we don't have enough money saved. Who knew getting married would be so stressfull. I keep telling John that we should go to Vegas and elope. But he isn't sold on that idea. Oh well. But I would love that photographer's number you can't beat that price for pictures esp. if they are done by someone who is good.  Also. I have Karissa's and Em's address. If I could get everyone else's I would love it. Kerri is asking me everyday for the list of people that I want to invite to our couple's shower. Even if we postpone we are still going to have the shower. It can be more like an engagement party or something like that. It's going to be the weekend of Oct. 6th not sure what day yet. I have to talk to Kerri about that.  Hope everything else is going well for everyone.
