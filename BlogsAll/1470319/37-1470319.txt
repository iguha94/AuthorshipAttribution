Funny you should ask that, Chris, because I went to Barnes last night and found the funniest book.  "Why Girls Are Weird" and I can't remember the author, but I thought, yeah, I can think of a whole bunch of people who need a book by that title.  I had to buy it, so I'll let you all know how it is after I finished the other 8 I checked out from the library and have time to read something I bought.  Oh, which reminds me I need to call my mom and see if she found the book I left behind this weekend.  It's got to be there because it's not at my house.  I think I'd lose my head if it wasn't screwed on tight.  Luckily I've grown pretty attached to it over the years...;)  It's going to rain so I'd better go out and roll up my car window.  I was going to wait until it started to rain but I just don't feel like running today.  The Tuesday swim instructor is a complete Sadist; nice enough out of the water but a complete tyrant while we work out.  I'm not sure my pectoral muscles are ever going to be the same, not to mention my legs.  I know, that's not a bad thing, but right now I'm glad I have a chair with wheels so I don't have to walk around as much today.  Besides that, rolling is fun. :)  I'm so looking forward to this weekend!  If Steph could come up it would be perfect.  Anyway, better get some stuff done.  Love ya all!  KJT:)
