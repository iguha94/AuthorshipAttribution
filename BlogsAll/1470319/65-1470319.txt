So how was everybody's weekend?  Did you have a good party?    I had a really good weekend with the fam.  My Grandpa wants to adopt Polly and they are going to get an RV and travel around the country.  Tressa has a couple of admirers in Jake and Maggie.  And the food.  THE FOOD!!!!  We had the best food in the world.  I have never had mashed potatoes that were beaten by hand be that creamy and smooth before.  The chicken and steak fell apart to the touch.  The bread and fresh butter were almost creme brulee good.  The vegetables were even mouthwateringly good.  If green beans always tasted like that, I'd never stop eating them.  And then there was the ice cream and pie.  Lemon cream pie.  Apple.  Oatmeal chocolate chip.  Vanilla ice cream so rich just looking at it added pounds to your hips.  Was it worth the 4 hour drive there and the 4 hour drive home?  Oh my, yes, and a million times more.  Next time, you're all coming with me.  It was $12 a plate and I think they were robbed.  Just a good meal all in all....  Now can anyone tell me why spending most of the day in a car can make you so tired?  I just don't get it.  I still feel jet lagged in a way that has nothing to do with it being Monday.
