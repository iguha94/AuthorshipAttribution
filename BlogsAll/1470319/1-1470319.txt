Cara- Well, we've been just talking- and we got together a week ago and had a really long talk- however, things are always up and down with him. Honestly, I just don't know what to do with him.  But I have a feeling that when I tell him I'm considering a job in Philly- he'll run for the high hills anyway....which is fine.  I'm totally craving Greek food- I hope Jen calls me soon!  I think that Bob's surprise was awesome. And the way you told the story was awesome- I was totally getting pissed. I'm glad he got you that Sims game- I was actually going to get it for you, b/c I know you really like it. I was at a friend's house last night and his roomate had the new Matrix game- I haven't seen either of the movies- but the game was freaking cool.  The finale of Friends (or what I saw) was terrible- WAY to predictible. I did hear that this was the last season- maybe just a few episodes to wrap it up.  Steph- I heard that Lugar was really boring. I also heard about the big "Peace" banner that people held up and that it was just like a really odd day overall. But I'm sure Kris is glad to be done and have his degree. I can't wait for that multi-thousand dollar piece of paper.  Anyway....I have to go get my oil changed.....talk to you guys later!
