So much for the G rating today... ;)   I knew that Douglas Adams and I were kindred spirits. I just didn't realize why until this lunch time. OK, so we have similar senses of humor and all that, but when he said this, it reminded me of what I've been saying to people all week. I have to make my life as difficult as possible. I don't know why; that's just how it is. This is what he had to say about writing Hitchhiker's Guide in and Interview with the Onion A.V. Club (found on page 164 of TSOD).  "And if ever there was and easy way of doing something, I would find a much harder way to do it."  Some of us just can't take the easy way out no matter what.  And now you're thinking, Jesus God! Isn't she ever going to finish that book? She's been reading it for more than 3 weeks and she's not even to page 200? What the hell is going on? I thought she had a degree in English Literature. Doesn't that mean she should be able to read more than 175 pages in 3 weeks? How many people did she have to sleep with to graduate? And how worn out was she when she graduated from grad school? No wonder she loves sleeping so much!  The answers are, respectively: no, I'm never going to finish this book. I don't know why, but I lose interest in it, pick it up again, read something funny, share it with you all, and then lose interest again. I hope one day to reach page 299 (the official end of the book), but the odds of that happening between now and this weekend, when I take the book back to my parent's so they can return it to their library, seem to be slim to none. So, apparently, no, I can't read more than 175 pages in 3 weeks.   How many people? One, I think, but I can't remember. It was the beginning of a dry spell that held out until just recently, actually. Now I'm being offered cock hand over fist, no pun intended...;)
