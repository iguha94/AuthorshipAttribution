I think I could go to the BTE show on Saturday. The Cunninghams are having a beach party that day at 12:30 but I don't plan on staying there long. I would LOVE to have an excuse to get out early. Bob's going to be at work anyway.   Fucking inventory is coming up and he's working even longer hours than usual. On Monday, he worked 8-5, then came home for dinner and then went back to work. He didn't come home until 1 AM! That night it stormed really bad and the electricity was out. I was actually sort of scared and that doesn't usually happen. What frightened me the most was the thought of going down into my basement with the power off. I am scared to death of this one room in our basement. When you guys see it, you'll know why. If it was between life and death that I have to spend a long period of time in that room, I would STILL have to think about it.   I think my parents might have found a place for lisa's shower. Ryan picked out the ring himself and even though it fit all her criteria....she still doesn't like it. Demand to pick out your ring, ya yas. Either that or show your friends now what you like in case he's smart enough to take one of them along. I still look at mine everyday! :)  I'm reading Fugitives and Refugees: A Walk in Portland by Chuck Palaniuk. The guy who wrote Fight Club and is my official favorite author. The King is no longer king.  Does anyone need directions?
