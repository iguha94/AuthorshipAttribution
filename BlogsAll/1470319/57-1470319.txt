hey guys, i'm really happy we all stay in touch.  ditto what em and karissa said.  cara, i know what you're saying about feeling for the victims' families, i feel the same.  but then i start thinking about how stuff like that (bombings usually) happen all the time in other countries and we are pretty lucky that more shit hasn't happened here to us.  i wish this stuff didn't happen at all anywhere.  we just have to move on and learn from everything that happens.  we did eventually go to that bingo thing last thursday.  the music was really good (great musicians).  i think you guys would like them.  it's a combination of all types of music.  and then they also show short films they make themselves and of course you get to play some bingo.    other than that, i've just been busy with work.  i actually just got done doing some work from home.    karissa, i would have been so pissed to go home and find the window wasn't fixed the first day!  especially with having pets.  i hope it gets worked out asap.  em, i know what you're saying about crying for no reason.  i do that too sometimes.  i have no idea why, but i think sometimes it is a way for your body to release stress.  so that's how i explain it to myself.    what's up with jen?  hope she's not working too hard!
