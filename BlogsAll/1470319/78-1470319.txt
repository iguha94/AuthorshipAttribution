Mr. Littlebrook, I'll have to contact the media/reserve department and see if they will let me have it.  I think if I say I need it for a class I can have it longer than the standard 2-day rental.  Is there any way we can rig up two VCRs and make a copy for you?  I know that breaks the law, but it might be easier than having to worry about getting it back in time.  Then again, if I check it out, I can always go in and delete what I owe them.  One of the few perks of being a librarian...:)  Why is it that when I feel like crap "Baby Got Back" makes me feel better?  I know I've been obsessing about that song quite a bit lately, but it was on that episode of Friends and it was so funny then that I'm in the mood to listen to it.  It'll be another song soon, but for right now, it's all about the ass...:)
