Bob and I are now the owners of what could possibly be the ugliest "painting" on earth. Grandma Rose went to Bob's dead Aunt Millie's house and picked out this god awful picture of Napoleon for us. Her house is full of antiques and we got this really large drawing of Napoleon and two other guys. The first thing Bob asked when he saw it was "did the artist use crayons?"  I really wish we lived on a different street. She was so excited about it that we couldn't tell her how ugly it is. We had to take it home. She's already called us once to ask us where we hung it.   My eye is bothering me again. Just out of the blue, it turned all red and it hurts. Luckily I'm going back to the eye doctor on Wednesday. I'm starting to think it's an ulcer because it happened so suddenly. I'm so afraid they are going to tell me that I can't wear contacts anymore. I'm very vain, I guess. Even though I did get new glasses. Even the lady at Lens Crafters hated my glasses. She looked at them and asked "how old are THESE? They are way too big for your face." My new ones kind of look like Jens.  Bob had to pick them out for me because I was too blind to see.   Emily, Mom says Lisa left her veil, tiara, flowers and birdcage for you at their house. She could only find three of the bridesmaid bouquets plus hers. She doesn't want any of it back except for the tiara and veil.
