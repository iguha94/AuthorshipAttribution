I know I have been lousy with the emails. Things are just crazy around here with getting the house set up. I want just about every room painted and there are STILL boxes every where. Doesn't help that the parents are now dropping off childhood shit too. Bob had a couple of boxes of t-shirts and match cars that his parents brought over the other day. The t-shirts are stained and have holes in them but he won't give them away. (I'm not going to even mention a pair of underwear that he REFUSES to throw away. I swear to god, you can see THROUGH them. Nasty.)  But once everything is put away, we're going to get a kitten. I'm very excited and it's good incentive for me to get moving. I want to name her Marla after Fight Club but I don't think Bob likes the name. I keep thinking of that one line, "if I had a brain tumor, I would name it Marla."   You do NOT have to worry about me asking anything about that freak, Jenny Devlin. The thought of her running a daycare sends chills up and down my spine. Chris says that she is really busting her ass on it though and is up to 12 kids!   ***WHITELAND NEWS UPDATE***** When I was at Amber Richter's shower two weeks ago, Liana Lewis was having her own wedding shower in the room next door.  Shawn Richter is getting married to a woman named Atlantis. (no joke...that's her name). The only thing I know about her is that Amber doesn't like her much and Atlantis blurted out to his entire family that she once had a lesbian experience in college. I think he met her at IU.   That's all I know, folks.
