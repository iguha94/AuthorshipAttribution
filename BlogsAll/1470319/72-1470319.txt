Cara, I had a really good time at the wedding and reception.  So did Sarah.  I think she likes your inlaws as much as the rest of us do. :)  Pam even invited her to come to the summer party next year.  If we can get Rob to behave, he might come, too...:)  Apparently, I have a date tonight with my neighbor's brother.  I was getting around this morning and Tony stopped by to see if I wanted to get some Chinese tonight.  He's a good guy so I said yes.  Why should I sit at home alone on a Monday night when I can have an attractive young man lounging around with me and the cats?  Besides that, he told me he thinks I'm beautiful.  And that was in the morning on my way to work, so that's pretty good. :)  I can say that the odds of anything happening with Tony are slim to none.  Good guy, yes, but I'm with Brian at the mo, and as much as I know he has no room to talk about me dating other boys, I can't do it.  I'm not built that way.  And yes, I'm going to explain the situation to Tony so he doesn't get hurt and doesn't think I'm hanging out with him just to play with Brian's emotions.  Hey, a screw just fell out of my desk.  How weird is that.  I didn't do anything I don't usually do....  "screws fall out all the time.  It's an imperfect world..."
