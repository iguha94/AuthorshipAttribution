An In-depth look at my father:  Ok- I sent an email to my dad asking for the list of people he wants to invite to the wedding- we're getting to that "narrow the list" stage- and I wanted to have it.  So he sent me the list- which I won't bore you with- but attached this little "bit" at the bottom. I'll point out that he "edited" himself so to speak on the Mike Tyson part- he knew it would piss me off if he said it otherwise.  But WHO is this funny man and what did he do with MY dad?   MUST INVITES Andrea Bocelli [directions in Braile] Van Morrison [ have a scripture quote on hand] Luther Vandross [have lots of diet pills on hand] Randy Newman [have lots of Bourbon on hand} Billy Idol [have lots of sun glasses to hand out] Michael Huxtable [ no, not a Cosby character] Tony Bennet [ lighting is essential ] George Jones [for your Granpa Roy] You never know, one might just show up! NON-INVITES George Michael [free willy my ass] The Massachusetts Supreme Court [not that there is anything wrong with that] Butross Butross Galli [just like to say his name] Joey Buttafucco or Danny Bonaducci [see above] Warren Sapp [ reminds me of Sharpton without hair] Mike Tyson [one angry nigga] Bill or Hillary [both should be banned to the Baltics] AND THE NUMBER ONE NON-INVITE IS.....JACKO! nuttin no good eva come outta Gary Indianna!
