Em: When do they want you to work?  Would they work on their vacations?  I don't think so.  Tell them you're still out of state and let them deal with it.  I mean, didn't you have to tell someone you were taking this time off so they'd know not to bother you?  How stupid are they?  Steph: It was good seeing you this weekend, too, but next time we need to get together for happier times.  I wish you'd been able to stay up here for another week, not just to be with your mom but to visit with us some more.  :)  Jen: I can't believe how long your hair is getting!  I forgot to ask, how is Gus getting along with his folks and his feline uncles?  I can't wait to see how big he gets, considering his parents.  :)  Cara: Are you looking forward to next weekend?  Do we need to bring anything with us aside from clean clothes and jammies?  If you'd like me to bring Cresent Doughnuts, I'll be happy too.  They make a good breakfast for lots of people.  Just be sure you have lots of milk on hand. :)  Just so you all know all of the family gossip, on Sunday my grandmother fell down and broke her arm just below her shoulder while she was outside watering plants.  She's doing fine, though, as far as I know.  This is Grandma Tatman, so Mom is hoping against hope that Dad doesn't invite her to come stay with them until her arm heals.  If anything ever causes them to get a divorce, that would be it.  I told Mom I'd board the cats and she could come stay with me if that happens; not the divorce but Grandma coming to stay.  As much as I wouldn't wish Grandma on anybody, I hope she either stays with one of her other kids or moves in with Rebecca and Chris.  Mom hasn't done anything to deserve that kind of visit, so send Grandma happy healing thoughts so she doesn't have to come to stay here.  Have a good day!  KJT:)
