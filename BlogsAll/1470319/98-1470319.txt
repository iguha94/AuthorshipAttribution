I can say that I've bought 2 of ya'll's (is that even sort of correct?) gifts and both were right at $15 each. So- I say- let's keep it around $15 and definitely NOT over $20.   Also- just FYI for anyone- even though it's not technically for this- you can totally pick something off of my registry if it makes it easier- and I'll speak for Jen (since she said this to me the other day)- you can do the same for her on her Babies R Us or Target registry- she really wants the baby stuff.  Just a few more months until the Grant Street Girls is passed to a new generation! How exciting- we're all going to be aunts!!!! (that's especially exciting for those of us who are not already).  Cara- I think it's cool that your parents are going to move somewhere warm- I can understand their thoughts about Lisa- maybe she can just visit on her own a few times a year- and then they can see Ryan when they come visit in Indiana.  I can say that even though I see my dad a lot less now (which is funny since our relationship is so much better now)- he is SO much happier in Nevada- so that is TOTALLY worth it.  If the 9th works for all of you- we can just plan on it at my house- that way Karissa can drive to Indy- Cara, you and Chris (if he is going to come too) can just come to my place (Sig Others are welcome- we just won't have gifts really). When it gets closer we can all pitch in for food and just hang out. It will be cool for you guys to see my new place anyway (hopefully it will be actually "moved-in" to by then.  Anyway- I totally slacked at work today- that's the problem when the boss is on a trip..yikes... Anyway....is anyone getting wicked gas in their old age?   My love to you all :)
