ok, so my boss came back to work.  doesn't matter anyway, i was busy all day.  the good thing is i will be getting commission soon for all of my sales.  em- we all knew you were a keeper anyway!  we could have told him that.  :)  kris's graduation was pretty boring too.  richard luger didn't even excite the retarded guy that was there.  his speech was long and booooooooring.  and then one of the female trustees went on about atom bombs and graduate's decisions?  everyone was either talking or sleeping.  but i am really proud of kris and i would sit through it again for him.  i think it's awesome that you finally get to hold your degree, em. cara- thanks for the advice, i'll definitely check it out.  i always liked the unpacking part of moving.  i think you should name your cat whatever you want. ;)   i did see part of the eclipse last night.  i was watching a movie most of that time though.  we saw x-men 2, which was pretty good.  i liked the special effects.  i am really enjoying all of these comic book movies. i'm glad that the office move is over for you now! :)  that kind of sleep you have when you've worked physically hard for a day is nice.    well, i'm super tired (and i even overslept for 30 min.).  talk to you all later.
