Cara, give Aunt Ellen a hug from me and tell her I'm so sorry for her loss.  Do you have her address?  I'd like to try to send her a card.  I know, my mailing abilities really suck, but your inlaws have made us all feel so at home and have made us part of the family, and I'd like to try to send her a card.  And if I don't, maybe someone else will.  What does an eye ulcer look like?  I'd go search for one on line, but I don't think it's really something I want to see.  I just want to hear what it looks like.  Did the eye doctor give you ointment to put in your eyes or will drops fix you up?  Do you have to sleep with a patch over your eye?  When my Dad had his Lasiks surgery and his epithelium tore, Mom had to tape patches over his eyes so he wouldn't rub them in his sleep.  She said it was kind of like sleeping next to a bandit, which isn't really a stretch of the imagination since he sleeps in the middle of the bed.  The Mattress Avenger, into dreamland!  I think that's where I get it.  Poor Brian and my mom; they both spend half the night teetering on the edge...:)  Yes, Baby Got Back is my current favorite song, but there are really lots of good ones out there.  I don't think I've heard the ones you all have been talking about, though.  I listen to WTTS most of the time and they have been over-playing the same stuff for a while now.  Plus you know me and titles of song and musicians' names.  I hear stuff and I'm like, oh, that's nice, I really like that, and then I just wait for it to come on again until I finally pay attention and hear who it's by and all that.  I love the new BNL song, Another Postcard(Chimps), though.  It makes me giggle every time...:)  OK, so we'll say that one is my favorite...:)
