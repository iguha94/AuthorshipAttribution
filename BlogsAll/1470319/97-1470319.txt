So glad I'm not the only one PMSing around here!  I'm in the middle of throwing a mental tantrum.  That's very different from a temper tantrum because no one else has to listen to it.  Mostly I'm just pissy and want a hell of a lot more chocolate than I have here.  I may have to run to Marsh to get some.  I have to get a gallon of milk anyway, and I feel silly writing a check for $2, so I'd better buy a lot of candy.    Tressa just told us this story about how a goat ate her ice cream at the zoo and her parents thought it was really funny so they took a picture of her while she was crying.  Parents are weird.  I'm being a slacker this morning.  I just want to play computer games.  I think I've hit post-holiday apathy.  And I'm pissed that Alex fell off the face of the earth.  I went in and deleted the few emails I had from him and erased his file from my yahoo account.  [Chris, when you read us complaining about men, please keep in mind, we're talking about  those  men, not you.  We love you. :)]  And it's Tuesday.  F*cking Tuesday.  Why are we all not home in our beds, borrowing under the blankets and pulling pillows over our heads?  Stupid Tuesday.  Ok, enough bitching.  Well, for the moment.  We should all have ice cream.  Now.  And chocolate.  But not chocolate ice cream.  That just wouldn't be right.
