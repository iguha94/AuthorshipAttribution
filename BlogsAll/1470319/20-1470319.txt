But if you house isn't taken care of, it's really hard to insure.  The house Sarah and Rob bought was a repo.  The people who lived there before were drug dealers (seriously).  They took everything that wasn't nailed down and some things that were.  So the house was stripped and some of the floors were rotten through and the downstairs walls are moldy because they weren't sealed properly when the house was originally built.  Cara, your house is way older than theirs, but yours is in better shape.  And you have working toilets, so you're already better off. :)  And have fun getting a kitty!  I'm almost jealous, but not enough so that I'd bring home number 5...:)  My boss has his all day interview for his job today.  He's been acting head of preservation since I was hired on as a conservation tech and they are just now getting around to officially filling his position.  I am on the search and screen committee, which really isn't that fun.  I have to look at all of the applicants and figure out who is going to compete with my boss for the job he has more than earned and proven that he can do well.  Then again, at least I got to go to the tudor room for lunch, so it's not all bad. :)  We'll all be glad when this is over, though.  We just want the position settled so we don't have to think about it anymore, and we all want Jake in the job because he's done such a good job getting everything in order and running smoothly both after Melissa left and since the move to the ALF.  To many politics and not nearly enough time to shoot the assholes...:)  Anyway, I'd better get some work done.  It's that time.  I've been running around all day and now I have to focus on work.  Why don't we have an offical nap time in this country?  I'd be less grumpy if we did...:)  Love you guys and more later!  KJT:)
