Jen, thank you.  That's just what I needed to hear.  It helps to remember that this is not a decision I have to make right this minute.  I get all tense and stressed about things like this and then remember that it's not life or death, right this minute, do or die.  So, I'm going to keep hanging out with Tony, spending time with Brian, and just see how it all turns out.  When the time comes to pick, if it ever does, I'll be ready.  Just as long as it's not today, we're all ok.  If my earlier post came off as bitchy, I'm sorry about that.  I know I get defensive really easily and I don't mean anything by it, it just happens.  And Jen, if you want some plastic cups, I have a ton of Pizza Express cups I'd be more than happy to share with you.  Remember how many we had at the GS house?  Yeah, well, living alone hasn't cut down that number any.  I have one cupboard full and another one that's starting to get a little tight.  They are really handy for heating water to warm bottles with, and if you freeze your breast milk you can put the bottle right in the water in the microwave and it works like a charm.  Even better, if they get ruined, it's not a big deal.  I will always have more.  I'm the plastic cup supplier, after all...:)
