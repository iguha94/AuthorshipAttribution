Wow- yeah, I'd say that would hurt Ryan's feelings...you can tell her I'll take it ;) I know this sounds kind of crazy...but is she sure she wants to get married??   Well, I'm still waiting for the call so that they can fax my written offer for the job. I have my resignation letter all ready to go- just need to have the final step in place before I do it. Tensions are mounting at work (mostly mine) so it would be nice to get it over with.  I spent the evening with Marshall last night- it was so nice to see him. I hadn't seen him in almost 2 weeks since we were both on vacation- I didn't realize how much I really missed him. I wish I could put that first hug into words- it was cool.  I'm actually sort of hoping that they will release me immediately after I give my notice, that way I can go home and take a nap. Even though I was home at midnight- I couldn't sleep and then f*ing Rene called at 1am. I didn't answer, but he's insane. I didn't want to have to call him back, so this morning I left him a voicemail the backway (without having to direct dial him) and left him a message- told him I appreciated his concern about how I am, but that I've been on vacation and that I have a new boyfriend and that he should know that while he's trying to call me all the time. I didn't say I'd talk to him later- I just said "take care". So, hopefully, that's the end of that.  Anyway, keep your fingers crossed about the formal offer today- mama needs a new bike. (yeah, whatever).
