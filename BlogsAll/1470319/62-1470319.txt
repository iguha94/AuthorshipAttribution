Cara I would love your entertainment center but I don't know how I would get it down here. So if Em and Marshall can find away for them than they could have it. Em-Thanks for the offer on the futon, but I am taking my old futon and either getting the mattress replaced or John is letting me have one that is at the Whiteland house I just have to see what shape that it is in. Plus I have the recliner that we bought for me and the baby at Goodwill. What I really need is like kitchen stuff. We got rid of most of our dishes and pots when we moved b/c we were registering for new stuff. So if you guys know of anyone who is getting rid of anything like that than let me know. If there is anything else that I can think of that I need I'll let you guys know. Thanks for all the support. All of you have been life savers and I am very lucky and grateful that I have such great friends.   Em-have you gotten my invites for the bach party and/or wedding? Also I would love a pic of you and Marshall.  I have no idea what the plan is for this Sat.   Cara-sorry to hear that you might have IBS. We are such a fun bunch of girls b/c like Karissa when I have emotional upheaval or alot of stress I end up in the crapper. You definately need to break Bob in w/the farting b/c trust me when you become pregnant you become a farting queen! You will put to shame even the most prideful beer guzzling red neck!! Not that I would know anything about that or not. :)  Karissa-glad to hear that you had a good birthday weekend. I rented Boat Trip the other night and it was really funny. It is out on DVD as the unrated version and I can't imagine what the rated version was b/c it was very unrated material.   On the Cubs front they won thier first game but lost last night to the Braves. So the series is tied 1-1. Keep your fingers crossed for the Cubbies. Thier next game is Friday night.
