If you've visited Shots Across the Bow to see Rich's "Those who do not learn from history" statement, you might have already figured out the mistake in his reasoning. By his own words, "the American public had no interest in the war in Europe prior to the Japanese attack." Dude! There was already a war going on. Plenty of people had died, cities were ruined and balance of power in Europe was in peril. My point was that the mobilization of anti-war sentiment is happening PRIOR to a war breaking out. Anti-war activists wish to preserve the balance of power and avoid the loss of life and the destruction of cities BEFORE any of this happens.  Another thing, Gulf War Part Two, is NOT aimed at putting a stop to widespread conflict or human atrocities (as the Democratic-backed intervention in World War II was). It is about outfitting an unprecedented global empire (as outlined by William Kristol, Richard Pearle, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, and Jeb Bush  in the   Project for a New American Century  mission statement which pines for "some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new Pearl Harbor"), and jack-booting any attempts by rival nations, or free people anywhere, to do anything about it.   Indeed, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. That's why I would suggest that Mr. Shots Across The Bow familiarize himself with Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War which documents how Athens' corrupted democracy was brought to ruin by the hunger for empire in the conquest of Sicily.
