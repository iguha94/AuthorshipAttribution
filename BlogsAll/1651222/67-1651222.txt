Dooley was a good ole man, he lived below the mill,  Dooley had two daughters and a forty gallon still.  One gal watched the boiler, the other watched the spout,  mama corked the bottles when ole Dooley fetched them out. Do Chorus  The revenue'ers they come for him, a slippin thru the woods,  but Dooley stayed behind them all and never lost his goods.  Dooley was a trader when into town he come,  sugar by the bushel, molasses by the ton.  Do Chorus  I remember very well the day ole Dooley died.  The women folk weren't sorry, and the men stood around and cried.  Now Dooley's on the hillside, he lies there all alone,  they put a jug beside him, with a barrell for a stone.
