I attempted to post this at work today...and thought that I could but it didn't work So now I'll give it a try at home (thanks anyway, Brook!)  HI Everyone! Okay, Ive been lurking long enough and for some reason the publish button is actually showing up today (my Netscape at work usually doesnt agree with the Blog). My memories are VERY VERY spotty- mostly due to 1986-1989. A while back I wanted to log on with a handfull of catty comments about the Fucking Prudes - decided that was just too expected and girl-ish of me. I also just HATE to be negative so Ill say this about them- for a talentless group of tasteless wanna-bes they really werent Too terrible. Plus - I dont think they really took their drinking seriously and I just could not respect that!  I remember the cock in sock night- Donnie Poole and I drove Kurt and John Hicks around. I remember we went to Rosalie and Sandras apt on Maple. I think that John or Kurt had a thing for Sandra because she seemed uptight and virginal. I dont remember if we made any other stops. I do remember driving past Jay Sweenys Used Auto Lot and Kurt deciding that Jay Sweeny would be a new term for his stuff. As in Ive got my Jay Sweeny in a sock   Now there's a phrase that really caught on!  I also barely remember the HRR. I do remember my ear being pierced. I think I remember early dawn hours and being in some sort of house with no window panes and some  farm animals hanging around. (looking IN the windows) As I write this Im thinking I might be WAY off base. I think that I donated all of this terribly disgusting greasy ground beef. For some reason my parents had gone in with someone on a half a cow and it was low low low quality beef. It was so greasy that when you were finished patting out burgers your hands looked like they were dipped in vaseline.  This is all that is on my mind at the moment. I cannot be held accountable for any misinformation. I love reading everyones stories! More later!
