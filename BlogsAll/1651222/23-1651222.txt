A Nitemare List.  This is a list I compiled the day after the Nitemares' last show at the Down Home.  Some are titles and some are lyric snippets cuz I don't know the title.  Those songs are signified by ellipses.  If I'm not sure of a title, it is between two question marks.  If it is a cover and I know the band I added that in brackets.  If I think it's a cover but don't know the original performer, I put a question mark in the brackets.  Please let me know if there is a song listed as original below but is actually a cover (plus who orginally performed it).  A brain dump. In no particular order.
