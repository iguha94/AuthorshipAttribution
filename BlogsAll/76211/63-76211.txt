   Sweet Dreams...Are Made of These   | The  Barcelona 2002  Blog  I would like to live in this picture. It is of Park Guell (Barcelona), which was designed of course by my future husband in my next life, Antoni Gaudi. I was very inspired while in this park - I'll describe it later, but it is just gorgeous. I keep hoping I'll dream about it soon. Speaking of dreams...I had a rather, er, 'intimate' dream the other night. No, it was not quite  that  kind of dream, but it was bordering on it. Anyway, the weird thing was that the dream was about a friend of mine and I've seen him since the dream and I think I actually blushed when I saw him, as if he knew I'd had the dream. What's extra annoying is that it couldn't have just been a nice harmless  fun  dream - no, even in my dream my conscience would not let anything happen. What is  wrong  with me? Anyway, it gave me an idea for a story which you might just be seeing here soon.   Made a few minor updates to   Smalljustice.com . I have heaps more to go and I can't wait to get the re-design happening!  The infamous Andrew B is back in town after spending 8 months in Korea. I am probably going to meet up with him tomorrow night so he can tell me wondrous tales of historical myths and facts and philosphical conundrums and how Koreans love Australians because they're both Anti-American. ;-)   iOTA is playing at the Hopetoun four nights this week and I have to see them one of those nights, hmmmmm...Gavin just rang to give me a hard time about us not having scheduled one band practice since I've been back - maybe we'll be inspired by iOTA.   I don't have the energy to type up the rest of the things I was planning on, so I'll continue to be the procrastination queen and say, Adios!
