Silly Girl   I am a very silly girl. I wanted to take Tuesday off from work as a sick day because I felt fluey - the whole bad sore throat, headache, fever, achiness, thing, but it was bad timing as we had this huge website due on Thursday (today.) So I went in and worked most of the day Tuesday and all day Wednesday on the website only to find what I thought (what we all thought) was final work and copy was actually NOT final anything. It was too hard to sift through and look for petty or major differences. What was the quickest thing? Do it all over again. Start from scratch. About four times too, as this person working with us 'accidentally' wrote over my content, after I'd spent a good amount of time putting in the proper html, links, tables,  etc. EXTREMELY frustrating!   Today was crazy. Felt ill, didn't have time for lunch, running around looking for things, trying to make sure it all got done.   Thought I was going to pass out from tiredness. And of course I looked wonderful at work today, all unshowered and wearing the same clothes and undies as yesterday. Yuck. At first I was upset - thought I should have had things done/organised faster, but considering we did most of the site in about 24 hours, I guess it's not so bad! Luckily I always keep deodorant/perfume at work, that helped. I could have killed for a toothbrush though!  Okay, it's 9pm now on Thursday and I haven't slept since 7am on Wednesday. Worked till 6.30pm tonight. Am ready to fall into coma. Good night! :-)  p.s. This is why everyone always wanted me to be in their group for work projects @ Uni/school  - because I'd end up doing everything. Same thing with me being "Editor" (notice the quirky quotations) of my high school yearbook. I have "sucker" and "perfectionist" and "insanely loyal worker" stamped on my head or something.  ;-)
