    Weekend in Review   As usual, I don't have time to get into everything that happened, but, here are some of the highlights/lowlights:    iOTA, must be mentioned again!   Coming across a blocked off street surrounded by policemen, due to a large, dead, bloody body under a sheet, and lots of broken glass indicating someone jumped or was pushed from the window of a tall building overlooking Hyde Park at 2am   Seeing the worst comedy show in years in Enmore with Mowzez. Habib does not deserve Parole! But it was free, woo-hoo!   Having brekkie with my old co-worker, his lovely partner, and their lovely 4 month old daughter on Saturday morning - 'Auntie Lori' brought her a butterfly!  Spending the day writing stories writing at Sydney Harbour/Botanic Gardens   Taking my first ferry ride ever to Balmain (have only been by bus)  Feeling like a secret agent blogging for Kristen.  Running into Graeme, Andrew, Helen, Jacqui, Lisa, and heaps of other people at The Town Hall on Saturday night with Mowzez.  Realising the entire population of Sydney arrived at the Town Hall around 1.30am  Calling my first (and hopefully last) ambulance for a poor homeless guy that was puking up blood on City Road.  Being serenaded by a cabbie singing Eminem lyrics to me.   Having one of your co-workers take your hand and put it on the back of his head and neck, making you feel a strange lump/growth and asking you, "So, what do you think this is?" Ew. I'm like, "Geez, man, I don't know what it is but I sure hope that when that thing hatches, it's not contagious!"    And that's all for today, folks! It's been grand. ;-)
