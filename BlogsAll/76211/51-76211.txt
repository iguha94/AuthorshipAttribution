Tuesday 23rd of July 2002    Blogger No Like Me!   My blog is sick. Poor bloggy. I've been trying to post something to this blog for about 4 days, to no avail. I can't add a new posting, but I can edit this one...weird...in the meantime, I'll be posting somewhere else...probably...details later! I'm in Rhode Island now, with my parents, Aunt, Uncle, and cousins. Hey Sheas! Hey McGuires!  --------   Boston or Bust   Well, it's time...time to make my pilgrimage to Boston aka Bean Town. I'm not particularly jumping for joy to get on the 2-hour Peter Pan bus fiasco which will inevitably require me to sit next to some smelly guy who talks to himself, but hey, thems the breaks. It's a small price to pay in order to visit my friends in Boston in the summer - yay! I head off tomorrow morning (Thurday, US-time) and come back Saturday arvo. I will definitely be seeing Shayna, Brian, Kelly, Steve, and the infamous Kristikeet! There are a couple other friends I might see, but time is tight, so we'll see what happens. That's probably the hardest thing when you live so far away - trying to pack all the friends and fam in when you come home to visit. :(  *Reminiscing about the time I was on the bus from Springfield to Boston,  sitting across from the smelliest guy in the world (and that's a pretty serious thing to say, as I know a lot of smelly guys) and I had this banana that was fairly ripe. I had it in a plastic bag and I kept inhaling the smell of ripe banana to keep me from passing out....I've learned lots of survival tactics in my old age! *  My stories from yesterday, and from Paris & Barcelona will have to wait....grrrr! Tonight I'm packing for Boston, Rhode Island, and Sydney. Crazy!  Hasta la vista!
