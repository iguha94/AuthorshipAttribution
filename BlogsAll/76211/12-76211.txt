I've had insomnia for like a week now. Slept a bit last night - but that's a lot more sleep than I've gotten lately. Part of it is my darn allergy pills that keep me up all night, definitely, and the other part is that I just have a lot on my mind. Tomorrow is my office Christmas party, and here's hoping it all goes well. I just got the instructions for what's needed this afternoon, so I'm keeping my fingers and my toes crossed that I get it all done in time, with no hitches! The best part is, we have no idea how many people are coming! Like 150 were invited, and maybe 30 RSVPd. Should be exciting ;)  Last night Kristen and I watched an Oprah prime time special with Tom Cruise. Only Oprah and Tom Cruise could get on prime time these days. It's really interesting to see how many Australians hate Tom Cruise now because of "what he did to our Nic!" :) Newscasters only interview angry Australians who are offended that Tom dumped their little darling, so it's hard to gauge how many people are actually upset at Tommy boy. But I was watching the news the other night and lots of people were saying they'd boycott Vanilla Sky because Tom Cruise was in it---and he dissed Nic. I feel bad for celebrities sometimes. Yeah, sure they've got tons of money, but they've got no sense of privacy. Whatever they do, wherever they go, the whole world is watching. Whatever happened between Kidman and Cruise is nobody's businesss. It takes two to tango and marriage is a dance that few people can understand from the outside. Hell, sometimes it's impossible to understand from the inside! But more about my aversion to marriage later on... ;)
