    Happy Birthday, To Me!   "Happy Birthday to Me! Happy Birthday to Meeeeee! Happy Birthday dear Meeeeeee-eeeee! Happy Birthday to Meeeeeeee! Any many more......"    oh yeah - I'm in Oz, "Hip hip - hooray!" x 3 :-)  So that's my first official birthday pic, taken precisely at midnight. Though I'm not technically 25 until 8.04am...and I was born in the States, so, I've got a ways to go, but close enough, dammit. I can no longer tick that young, safe 18-24 year-old age bracket on forms anymore! I've been bumped up to the 25+ category.  Do I look any older? The real question is, could I look any younger? I could be 14, geez!  Things I thought while taking b-day photo: 1. Boy is it cool having a new digital camera! 2. Boy is it hard to take a picture of myself. 3. Dear god, my head is big. 4. Could my face BE any rounder? (a la Chandler Bing) 5. Thank you to my orthodontist. 6. Why do I always look drunk in photos? I had a can of Coke tonight. And water. That's it 7. Holy cow, are my lips really that big? I think I have intimidating lips. Maybe that drunk girl @ the Glenmore Hotel was right. (Only  Fidelma  and Jorge will really appreciate this.)  Happy Birthday to Tim (you're only older by 4 hours, so don't get too cocky!) and Dave (you're still a baby, baby!) and to Auntie Nancy (still 35, huh? ;-)  Hope to see you guys tonight!  p.s. It is impossible to embarass me about my birthday, so don't even try! Does that sound like a dare? ;-)
