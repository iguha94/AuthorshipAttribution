Hey Mom and Dad Come look at the TV screen It's the coolest movie I've ever seen Wicked special effects, a visual delight Smoke and screams and fire with editing so tight You'd swear those were real airplanes On some top secret mission, a heroic flight As long as the good guys kill the bad guys Everything is going to be alright  Look at the people running Look at all the people screaming Look at all the people crying Look at all the fireman and police Trying to save all the people from dying I don't recognise any of the actors But they're all so good at playing pretend I don't know the name of this movie But we should rent it from Blockbuster on the weekend I must have turned this on in the middle I don't really understand the plot- do you know who started the fight? As long as the good guys kill the bad guys Everything is going to be alright  Look at the terror on their faces Like New York City's all going to burn and stop I'm on the edge of my seat now Let's make some popcorn, with extra butter on top Wow, so many ant-like people, all jumping from the roof While hundreds of others are trapped inside Where's the heartthrob hero? Where's his big gun? As long as the good guys kill the bad guys Everything is going to be alright  Everyone's running away now, covered in a thick dust I can't believe how real this seems This film's got to be up for Oscars in everything Best Director, Best Sound, Best Screenplay, Best Editing Incredible, one tower just fell, like some great big house of cards Cool, there goes the other one - leaving a great big gaping hole Who was the genius who computer generated this visual delight? Isn't it amazing what they can do with technology today? Imagine if that really happened? Not that anything like that could really happen Sisters and brothers Fathers and mothers Friends and lovers Sons and daughters Husbands and wives None of them are coming home tonight Thank God it's just a movie As long as the good guys kill the bad guys Everything is going to be alright   We miss you, Michelle.
