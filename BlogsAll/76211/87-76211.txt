Melbourne Cup Madness   I have to give Australia credit - there's none of this half-assed appreciation of sports - it's all or nothing, baby! Yesterday was the big Melbourne Cup hoopla. It's just a horse race...(I can hear several friends screaming, 'It is not  just  a horse race,  Lori!' ) but anyway, to me, it's just a horce race. Nothing bad about that - I like picking my favourite horse by the coolest name etc, etc, but what I like most about the Melbourne Cup is the excuse to stop working for most of the day.   We all moseyed down to the pub for a lovely lunch and some drinks around 1.30pm. Ummmm, I left the pub around 11pm and some of my co-workers were still there.  Gotta love the funny tipsy conversations between co-workers that occur at the pub after 9 hours!  I'm doing well so far n my 'challenge' for the week. I'm not allowing myself any major caffeine (so no coffee, no caffeinated teas, no carbonated beverages), and nothing fried for a whole week. Trying to drink lots of water, etc. I have a can of V sitting in the office fridge, but I will not touch it this week, dammit!  Mum and Dad - got your voicemail - will ring you guys sometime in the next couple days! The time change is different now - so check my blog to see what time it is ;-)  Special K (my fave Seattlelite!), your html goddess will write with answers very soon! ;-)
