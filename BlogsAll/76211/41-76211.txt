Presenting Lori Croft in 'RoomRaider - Along Came a Spider'    It's Official!   I'm going places! Woo-hoo! Okay, so I'm going to spend my entire tax refund before I get it, but hey, I'm used to being poor! I leave for the States on June 24th...and then jaunt off to Europe briefly to see Rachel and Anthony in Paris (will try ringing you guys in the morning!) and Javier in Barcelona. I'll only be in Europe for a little over a week. Then it's approximately 3 weeks in Springfield...with visits to Boston/New York. I can't believe it. I paid for the tix today, so no turning back now. I'm destined to be poor, but I'm okay with that! I have had an obsession with Picasso for the past few years and to think that in a few weeks I will be at the Picasso Museum, I've got chills. And I've been obsessed with Monet for several years (many of my songs have references to Monet), so you can imagine my excitement. I can't wait to see Rachel, Anthony, and Javier - so cool to have the opportunity to see them all in such a short period of time. There's lots to do and sort out before I leave though, oy!   Do you like this dodgy 'Lori Croft' pic? It's all Rammstein's idea. He suggested 'Lori Croft' and 'RoomRaider' and the cans of Mortein and everything. Thanks for the inspiration, Rammstein! It's verrrrrrry poorly done, but I think it's funny and not tooooo pathetic for a 20 minute procrastination break. And yes, that does look like the spider that was in my living room. (Feeling my family in Springfield shudder from here.) As my mother pointed out in a recent e-mail, "You have jumped out of two planes, you should not be afraid of a spider."  True, Mum, but alas, phobias are not logical. :-) I am a wuss, I know!
