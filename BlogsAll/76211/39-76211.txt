Early Birthday Present & 'Old Skool Music'   Wow, today was a funny day. I arrived at work to find a package on my desk. I assumed it was something for  Yap . CDs or games or something. So I open it up. And what is it, but an early birthday present. My jaw dropped open. It was a digital camera from the Prak-Man. I am still in shock. Thank you, Prak-Man, though I'm going to pay you back whether you like it or not! :-)  So I'm currently trying to figure out how to use my new digital camera. I hate manuals of any kind so I'm gently pressing all the buttons. I've taken a few pics but no luck getting them of the camera yet. And I don't think the battery is fully charged yet. Probably just leave it over night....so excited about the new toy!  I spoke to my favourite travel agent today and she's on the hunt for prices for my desired destination. I don't want to say where I want to go yet, for fear of jinxing it. I most likely will not be able to afford it, but here's hoping! I should know something more definite tomorrow.  Today and yesterday I brought my walkman to work. When I told my coworkers I'd brought it in they looked at me blankly for a second. "You know, so I can play audio tape cassettes?" More blank stares. "Oh yeah! Tapes!"  Hehehe :-) I brought in my 'Butterfly In Oz' mix of songs that were important/funny/significant to those of us who spent 6 months in Sydney on the Boston University program. Here's the tracklist (from memory):  "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" - U2 (The theme song of Lori and Jorge!)  "Sweet Dreams" - Eurythmics (It was thanks to this karaoke number that I suddenly became popular with 70 Americans and various Irishman at St. Patricks)  to be continued...
