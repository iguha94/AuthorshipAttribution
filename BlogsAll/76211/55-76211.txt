Fish Outta Water   Hmmm, so it's taking me a bit longer to re-adjust to Sydney than I expected. I am probably nuts as this is only my 3rd day back in town, but usually I'm pretty much re-adjusted to wherever I am within 24 hours. Am I slowing down in my old age? Work is crazy, though it's nice to see that the boys have finally learned how to answer the telephone in my absence. (Hi boys!) I had two sandwich shop owners yell at me for not telling them I was going away. What was I supposed to say? "Toasted Ham and Cheese, please - by the way I'm going overseas for 5 weeks, can I have salt and pepper on that?" :-) I walked in to one shop this morning and 4 workers were like, "Lori! Welcome back, Miss America! Miss Springfield, you're back!" Hahahaha. Too funny. And the work clients seem awfully relieved...."OHMYGOD, you're back! Thank GOD! Do you know how much we've missed you?" Poor gits.  So, the re-adjustment is slow. I was only gone for 5 weeks. Feels like 5 years. I wake up not knowing where the hell I am. Oh, and I cannot sleep past 3am!!!! WTF! Is this reverse jet-lag? I go to bed between 9 and 10 and by 3am, am wide-awake, not to get sleepy again until my alarm is about to go off. I haven't really hung out with or called any friends yet except for the mini-gang on Monday - haven't really been in a social mood, but I'm hoping to be my perky little self again in a few days.   Looking forward to the party at Fan-Man's this saturday! Woo-hoo!  Okay, going home, to bed, I hope. What an exciting life I lead! :-)
