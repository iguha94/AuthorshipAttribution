"Sleep, Sleep is Good"   Only Rammstein will fully get the title for today's blog, but the general idea is what I mean today. As I barely slept Friday or Saturday nights and I slept badly last night. Lil' Loz's (Aussification of Lori) been tired all day long. It is about 9pm and I was supposed to do some web work tonight, but methinks I'm going to go to bed now as I've got an early meeting @ work tomorrow. (By the way, Chad, my co-workers/friends  have  been calling me Loz...in addition to Lozza, Lozzarina, Lozzana, Lozzy Lozzy Lozzy Oy Oy Oy [yeah, I know], Truck and of course Butterfly and Biscuit, and other terms of endearment I won't type here. But thank you for pointing out that technically, Loz is my proper Aussie name as it contains less syllables than Lori ;)   There are lots of cool musical happenings this week and I really want to go to them all, but there's a chance I may miss all of them - crazy huh? Sad, really...but I've got after-work drinks tomorrow, Chaos Theory class on Wednesday, and Valentine's Day a.k.a. "Thank God I'm Single" Day to celebrate with all my single female friends on Thursday. So hopefully Friday/Saturday will give me that music boost I'm needing if I can't pack it in during the week.   I had a dream last night that I was on a talk radio show trying to figure out the biggest questions of the world...i.e.  "What is the meaning of life?"  "Is there a God?"  "Is there life after death?" "Why are we here?" and "Why do I always come up with new melodies for songs when I'm in the loo?"  Maybe I'll dream the answers tonight! ;)
