Writing Weekend, Chatty Sunday   Had an amazing weekend down in Kiama with my Writer's Group. I love those gals! It was a weekend full of writing, chatting, gossip, more writing, writing exercises, good food, tea and biscuits, wine, and walks along the beach. Kendall Beach is gorgeous. I highly recommend. This is just a quicky to say the birthday pics are just about ready to go, I've just been too slack to put them up live yet.  Just got home from Kiama this arvo and then I went to see my friend Bonnie's blues band play in Newtown. She is fantastic! Lisa and I ran into Graeme there and I've been meaning to catch up with him for ages. We ended up at The Townie with Nick and Deb, two funny characters. Deb asked me about 5 times how I met Graeme. It was hilarious because she mentioned the movie  Memento  at one point and that's exactly what talking to her was like. I should have started making up crazy stories about how I met Graeme. Anyway, we didn't get to hang with Bonnie long, but she was fabulous and we'll catch up soon. Lisa, Graeme, Nick, Deb, and I had one hilarious conversation after another. Nick first greeted me with a "I know you from somewhere!" and I said, "Yup, you've driven me home before!" (Get your minds out of the gutter, it wasn't like that!) Sydney is such a small small world!   To Rachel and Ant, I am so sorry I missed you once again! I will actually try again to call you tomorrow or the following day!   Happy Belated B-day to Uncle Sean. I will make it up to you, I promise :-)
