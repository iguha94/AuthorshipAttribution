Swimming Like Fishes, Birthday Madness, Good Chats, and Desperate Men  It's going on 4am and I just got home from Lisa and Ingrid's joint birthday party. I had a ton of fun tonight. It was just really relaxed and laidback. Lisa and Alex live in a beautiful house in a beautiful neighbourhood in Mosman with a beautiful view. And I brought my bathing suit, so I had a nice long dip in the pool. Everyone was really nice. I met some really lovely people and I got to catch up with another old co-worker of mine, Dan.   I'm currently listening to Alicia Keys,  Songs in A Minor . Oh to have her pipes!  I am zonked!   Tomorrow I am going to learn all about cricket! The super sweet and brave   Shay  has offerred to teach me the rules of the game. I've been here two years and no one has ever told me what's going on. I am looking forward to 8 hours of instruction tomorrow with some great company and some good snacks. I am intrigued by a sport involving sweaters and tea breaks! Plus, looking forward to seeing Shay and Sal's famous Paddington Pad!  On my way to Mosman, I was waiting for the bus at Wynyard and all of a sudden this guy comes over to me and puts his arm around me and asks me if I want to go home with him. He was obviously smashed. I was like, "Don't touch me," and his friend ordered him to, "take your hands off of her."  What a freak. The idiot persisted in telling me how "sexy" I am and asked for a root. Charming. I moved to another bus stand and he followed me to ask if I wanted to go home with him. What is wrong with people?  Then, on the way home, I had the taxi drop me off just down the street from where I live. Literally a minute walk away. This car passed me and pulled over on my street corner. The guys leaned out and asked me if I wanted a ride home. FREAKS! I am living up to my "attractor" nickname! I thought my perfume was vanilla and not "eau du desperation."  Anyhoo, still had a fun night dancing and chatting.   Sweet dreams.
