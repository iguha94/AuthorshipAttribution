I forgot to write yesterday that one of my bosses had an excellent idea. He told me he thinks I should become a child actor. Hahahahahaha....can you imagine me telling my family? "Hi, Mom and Dad, I'm all grown up now, so I've decided to become a child actor!" :) This came out of a conversation we were having that was inspired by Alient Ant Farm's rendition of "Smooth Criminal." Of course it made me think of Michael Jackson and how I think it's such a shame that now when people think of him, they associate him with child molestation etc. I told my boss how I was in love with Michael Jackson when I was about 8. I thought I was going to marry him. Of course when I was 9 I was going to marry Jon Bon Jovi. And I wanted to marry the Karate Kid (Ralph Macchio) around then as well....not to mention Patrick Swayze and Joey Tempest (remember the band Europe?) Needless to say, my tastes were pretty loose.  Anyhoo, we got to talking about The Karate Kid and I mentioned that I read somewhere that Ralph Macchio was like 35 when he did that movie (okay probably more like 24, but he looked about 14, so you see where I'm going with this. (Wait, I just realised....I think Patrick Swayze was 35 when he did Dirty Dancing, my bad.) So the fact that Ralph (Daniel) was about 24 or older and looking like he was 14 and playing a kid in highschool. So this inspired my boss to suggest that I become a child actor since I look so young...  Something to think about, definitely ;)
