Here's Lookin @ You, Mum!   Happy birthday to my Mum! Congrats, Mum, you are finally 35! You made it! I hope you have a super b-day and I will be seeing you  very  soon! - Love, Lori (your favourite - and only - daughter)  ;-)   WOO to the HOO!   It's been great fun trying to get lots of work done at work before my departure, sorting out immigraton paperwork, planning trains and accommodation in Europe, trying to pack and clean my apartment, all while not knowing for sure whether or not the whole visa thing was even going to happen. *Cue Aerosmith  Livin' on the Edge  music.* And thank you to all those doubting-toms who asked me things like, "Are you going to give up the apartment?" "What if you can't get back in the country?" What if the visa doesn't work?" Look, I'm a glass is half-full sorta gal, so believe me, it's not like I hadn't thought of those things and I love you all for caring, but I have to just keep plodding along like everything will work out in the end, and it usually does.    The good news is that I just found out that my company's nomination (of me) has been approved! YAY! That means I can now officially apply for my visa - well, I can once I'm in the States. You can't even apply for the visa if the nomination is rejected. So half the battle has been won. Hence, WOO to the HOO!  Going to celebrate by seeing  Spiderman  tonight with Graeme. Weeee!
