Global Warming   I know global warming is bad, verrry bad, but damn it was nice this weekend! Summer weather in winter. I was very happy! Saturday night was the dual Ray and Jorge birthdays - we thought of you too, Heather! We had dinner at a yummy Greek place and then we went out dancing. I was toning down the dancing so as not to embarass my friends, but the moment I walked into this one club, this old guy came up to me, yelled "Woo-hoo!" and grabbed me around the waist, kissing me on both cheeks. What is wrong with people???  Sunday I saw the premiere of  Stuart Little 2  at Fox Studios, with the lovely Claudine and her adorable daughter Mia. Mia is 2 and was a bit frightened of the Stuart Little in costume dude, but seemed to really like Stuart on the big screen! Then, I spent the afternoon at Bondi with Rocky, Paulo, Marvin, and Mia. We went to the beach in winter. I could not stop thinking this. It was a gorgeous day and I wished I had my bathing suit.  Got some writing done this weekend, and some pesky chores that needed doing...my belated b-day present for Ruth was the envy of everyone on Saturday night - a book called,  I Don't Need to Have Children, I Date Them -  19 Methods of Child Psychology You Can Use on Men . I know Ruth will find it useful. ;-)  Gotta jet - later kiddies!  p.s. Am currently obsessed with Counting Crows' new CD,  Hard Candy  - at the moment I especially love "Hard Candy" and "American Girls" -- and I swear I like "American Girls" because it's damn catchy, and not because of the title ;-)
