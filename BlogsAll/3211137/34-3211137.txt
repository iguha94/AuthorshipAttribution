         How many day hath past since my last post?   Verily, I say it has been many, for mine post hast passed into the archives like flowers into winter's first snow.   Alas, alas for me, for what shall I say now that I at last post? What news to report?   Random bad things keep happening to me.  Yesterday a saxophone mouthpiece hit me in the head, and I've still got a scab.  Today I threw up for no apparent reason.  I also had a random headache and tripped over a microphone cord somewhere in there.  However, I'm still in surprisingly good spirits, possibly because there is no band practice today.  Also, I'm going to see la obra de teatre de Erin y Marten. (I apologize for the language switch.  When I can't think of an English word I use a spanish one.)  I was thinking about asking a girl to go with me, like on a date, but I probably won't. And now an announcement.  My next post will be my 10th post, and will have a J title.  Since 10 is a milestone and J is the best letter in all the alphabet, it shall have to be an excellent extravaganza of a post.    An amusing comic.(The beginning may not make much sense, but it's the last panel that's funny.)  Instead of my normal ending section, I'll conclude with this.    Huzzah! Doom Sporks for everyone!
