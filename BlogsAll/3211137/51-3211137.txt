         Or rather, of Marten, who won the quarter.  Michael got the cough drop and Erin, the next time I see her, will be awarded the lint.  Sophia and Nathan get imaginary cookies.  Thomas, however, has not posted and will recieve the hat of shame.  This is a paper hat that says  SHAME  on it in big black letters.  Now, Match up time. I put a lot of thought into the last match-up and decided that Stephen Sondheim, as a composer, might get distracted by the pitch and rythm of the little "bloop" noises and lose.  The pitbull, however, as a pitbull, has no opposable thumbs and isn't tall enough to reach the controls, so old Steve only has to hit the ball once.  Winner: Stephen Sondheim.  Next:  Claire Danes VS Natalie Portman in a waffle-eating contest.  Only the catch is that they are also riding on unicycles, and to win, one must eat the most waffles  and  survive the obstacle course without falling off of the unicycle.  Claire Danes is equipped with an industrial strength vacuum cleaner, and Natalie Portman has a huge autographed picture of the pope.  So, now, to business.  Michael - I am intrigued.  What does this bandwagon jumping entail?  Just that comic, or perhaps others?  Nate and Soph - Do you think those little short posts get you off the hook?  I want real posts or you'll all be wearing SHAME accessories.  (Personal Note: Must find a way to keep SHAME gear from becoming fashionable.) Marten- Today is the day I abuse an admin power.   But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'
