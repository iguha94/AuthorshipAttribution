         So, I failed to mention that Ashley was cofounder of Ah, my aching sushi.  This led to some fighting and...(I'm editing out Ashley's sn, in case she'd rather it not be all over the net) The Squid3188: I'm really sorry about all the killing Ashley: It's ok The Squid3188: But noe you're a creepy undead zombie Ashley: I know Ashley: And I want to avenge my death The Squid3188: crap Ashley: Hmm...

A: I've known all along! A: YOu see, they had you do that, so that I'd kill YOU off The Squid3188: but why do I care if they're having an affair? A: You don't A: But they are evil adn wanted to kill you off A: THey had this idea that you'd interfer A: SO they got me to do it after I dies A: *died The Squid3188: but you won't A: But I will The Squid3188: that'd be playing right into the hands of the girl who betrayed you, took your boyfriend, and plotted the circumstances that led to your death! A: Right A: Give me a good reason not to The Squid3188: I'm on your side!  We're both victims.  But with my superpowers and your zombieness, we can defeat them A: Hmmm.... A: But what good would it do me? A: I'm already dead A: What do I care A: I could just kill you and then you and I could be dea together A: See?

And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.
