I tried to convince Kiel, but now hes gonna try out for section leader, or cult leader.  poor soul.       Your next point is a valid one. I made it on the post that never was, because my comp screwed up and deleted it.  Hey, readers that I didnt send a link to, find someway to tell us ur reading it!  Kinda locks, most blogs have a little spot for comments or notes.    i think we should start an online socratic cafe even if no ones reading it. It will be fun.  Hurray philosophy.  nate, Ur topics are all gossipy, or about people.  Other than the fact that we dont know these people, It is kind of the lowest form of conversational intelligence         we love you too, Sophia.  See? evil people can change over time.  Don't diss ur own species so much. though thats a bit of an exageration, u werent evil, we were just ahead of our time.  While I do approve of what our country is supposed to stand for, I can agree that weve become decadent and desesitized as a society, and the fact that we blame the media doesn't help.  It only keeps us from doing anything about the real cause of the proble, and that is that kids are raising themselves.  but i skipped a bunch in that, and it prolly doesnt make too much sense. I agree with schuck kinda, Were gonna fall like Rome soon. Prolly by the end of this century, if not quicker  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
