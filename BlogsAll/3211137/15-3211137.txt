            Whoah.  I'm exhausted.  Choir concert today.  I'm hesitant to say anything about it for fear of that sounding like the most important.  We did well.  I, on the other hand, made a complete ass of myself onstage.  But apparently Mrs. Dingman is the only one who noticed.  I don't know.     One good thing about being in the prestigious top three choirs is you get to watch the Hip Street girls change clothes.  Of course, their overall hotness level went down a notch when Danielle left, but it's still at, like, 9.6 out of 10. Which means Laura must be, like, a 22, as I realized I'd actually rather look at her fully clothed then watch them in their underwear.      Kudos to Millenium, they improved dramatically since Thursday.  They've still got a long way to go, though.  But so do we all.      Shiny red doesn't become me.  Just had to say that, cause it's so true.  I have a whole new respect for Lexi; she got my hair to stay back and up.  The combination of that and the suit, of course, made me look like a colombian drug lord, but that's life.  Lexi is also I have to say the most attractive African American girl I've ever met.  Not to say black girls aren't attractive, just that it's better than saying "Fourth hottest girl". (By the way, number 3 is actually Mexican, so don't tell me I'm being racist).  She's a senior, though, so just about as off-limits as Tiffany.  Oh well.    Thank you for your comments Soph, they made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, but not fuzzy like when you eat mold.  In the words of Pete Abrahms, "And that's it.  I'm going back to bed."
