         My new semester schedule contains one highly awesome element:  As many lunches as I want!  Ok, well technically just whichever lunch I want but I can get away with more than one easily.  It just so happens that my North Star period (which is during a beginning journalism class, so I'm the only one in it) is during a lunch period.  Since I'm one person and the administration won't notice, Hayes said I can go to any lunch I want.  First day I went to two and he didn't notice.  If he asks, I was doing interviews. But other than that, the new schedule kinda sucks.  Two new teachers, one boring but nice and one who I thought was mean but she's just old.  I guess overall it's a wash.  In other news, The Pajama Game is a sexist musical.  It has three or four girls chorus songs, no guys songs and only about three that guys even sing on.  Being male chorus is quite pointless, particularly knowing I will be cut from all the dance numbers.  I'd better get lines, or else this musical will be a huge waste of my time.  There is one post left before the alphabet fails me, so please tell me what to do. Marten, you should bold the end thingy in the template so it doesn't blend with everything else.   Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!
