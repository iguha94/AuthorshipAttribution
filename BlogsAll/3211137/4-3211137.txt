         Lol, Marten might need to get his stick out of his closet.    Nathan :  Alright, I apologize, I'm sorry.  I was kinda being mean calling you a donkey and stuff (cuz that was the ass I was referring to).    Jonah :  Of course there are other guys!  lol, you didn't seriously think ya'll were the only guys I flirted with!  I can at least think of four others off the top of my head.  And about Claire...I am sorry, but I still think high school relationships are pretty stupid, so I knew ya'll were gonna break up.  It's just a fact of life right now.  But I'm very proud of you for breaking up amicably.  That's always wonderful.  So...support!  Larry :  Haha, my nickname's Sofa, so it's all good.  And, yes, it's only the FCV band room that smells like that.  I actually noticed that while I was there, too!  LC's band room isn't bad at all...you just have to ignore how many sweaty marching band members have practiced in there and it smells perfectly normal!  lol.  BTW:  You aren't considering joining marching band...are you?????  Marten :  You turd muffin!  You didn't say anything about my wonderful couch!!!  lol just kidding...but you still didn't say anything to me.  :-(.  hehe  So...that's it.  See ya'll tonight!!!!!  SO EXCITED!!! SQUEE!
