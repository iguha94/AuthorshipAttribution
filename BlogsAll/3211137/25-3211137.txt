         Michael: As I have been given the go-ahead, I'll save you the trouble of pulling this out of Marten. Yes, as you probably suspected, it was I who wrote the angry letters, though I was not the only one who was angry. Nonetheless, I will answer your particular challenge. And since I have bridged this gap, I may as well provide a translation to my earlier Huttese comment. It means, "The last fool who called me that got his antennae stuffed down his throat. Do you feel lucky, punk?" To that I will add: Kee baatu-baatu. (You bother me.) Kava doompa D'emperiolo stoopa. (You are a low-down Imperial fool.) What? You think it's easy being the Queen? Now, I don't know you, Michael, and you don't know me. But nobody around here appreciates your arrogance but you, and the minute Marten gently tried to inform you of this, you threw a little hissy fit. To put it briefly, I don't like the way you treat Marten, and I don't like the way you refer to others. You are free to "mock me mercilessly," as you put it, but know that I am willing to match you blow for blow, and that I frankly don't care much about what you have to say and thus have little concern for your lack of mercy. I hesitate to pull rank, but... Coughsophomorecough. In conclusion, I cite a quote referring, in case it is unclear, to a certain place over Slice way in Lancre, conveniently located between a Rock and a Hard Place:  "Stuck it up your jumper, sir. Stick it, in fact, up your jumper. Named after Colonel Henri Jumper, I believe. A useful woolen garment akin to a light-weight sweater, sir, which, if I recall correctly, was named after Regimental Sergeant Major Sweat. That, sir, is where you may stick it." -Lieutenant Blouse, Monstrous Regiment by Terry Pratchett  Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!
