         In case some people haven't heard me say this yet, go see Love Actually! Great movie. Not just one happy ending-- but lots!  This weekend I am finishing college and Prelude applications, studying for precal test, working on research paper, memorizing my lines as queen of the trees, and making elf hats. Hopefully somewhere in there I will fall unconscious and not wake up until December 20.  I am six lines away from being finished with my latest parody, "At the End of the Day- Naboo Style!"  I have a horrible suspicion that, were there to be an online Socrates Cafe, I wouldn't have enough time to attend.  Jonah's blank entry leads me to suspect that he may be the Phantom Menace. I have a bad feeling about this...  Segue to Erin's Fanfiction Recommendation of the Week ("You might not care, but I do."): The Shifty Troublemaker, a TPM parody on fanfiction.net. This piece is very clever: frequent references are made to George's quest for more money through spectacular marketing and his love affair with impressive CGI creations such as Jar Jar and the Wizard Eopies, not to mention the Lego (tm) Podracers. Anakin has tourette's. Coruscant is one giant disco bash. Qui-Gon loves his drugs and perhaps a certain young Scot. This fanfic is the origin of the infamous penguin line. Need I say more?  Whats the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?
