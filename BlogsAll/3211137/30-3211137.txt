         Hey guys!  Fixed my name so ya'll could figure it out.  lol.  Okay, I feel  kinda  bad about saying this, but,   ROMEO AND JULIET WAS THE FUNNIEST PLAY I'VE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!  Watching Daniel Day as Mercutio...oh my goodness, I had no idea that he was supposed to be so flamboyantly gay!  I'm glad Daniel brought it to my attention.    Nathan, you were really funny as the old man!  Never really figured out who you were supposed to be...but you cracked me up nonetheless!  And as Friar Lawrence, you were great.  I'm really proud that you could memorize those lines...lol I have enough trouble memorizing NORMAL English, let alone OLDE ENGLISH!  Haha, Lord Capulet was the funniest.  Whenever he'd talk...I'd lean over to Kelly and be like..."Did you understand anything he just said?"  And she'd be like, "I have no idea."  lol cuz it sounded like all he was saying ::add lots of dramatic inflections, yet still sounding like a drill sargeant:: "blebleblehblehblehblehbleh."  I really thought he should be a drill sargeant...he'd be good at that.  Shoot, is it spelled sergeant?  I'm confused.  And completely exhausted.  OOOOOOOO GUESS WHO PLACED IN BOTH HER SPEECH ROUNDS TODAY!!!!  I bet you'll NEVER EVER IN A MILLION YEARS GUESS!!!!!!!  Well, actually, Nathan will...cuz he was there...yay speech!  So I'll just tell you.  ME!!!  I PLACED 10TH IN PROSE AND 4TH IN OI!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Okay, that's enough excitement for this issue of Sofa's insane slap-happy hour, please stay tuned for the next episode!
