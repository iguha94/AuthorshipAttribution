         Branson, MO, is without a doubt the cheesiest city in the united states, possibly the world.  This makes it absolutely perfect for a National show choir competition.  I've come to the conclusion that when a person does show choir long enough, that huge cheesy smile becomes a permanent facial feature, and they can't turn it off.  And having 16 choirs worth of show choir people in one place for 4 days only compounds the problem. In all seriousness, though, it was really fun in a cheesy sort of way.  You know what else is true about show choirs?  They tend to attract their share of, shall we say, loose women.  I talked to a girl for maybe twenty minutes on Saturday before she tried to kiss me.  When I told her I had a girlfriend, she immediately moved over to Cristian, stealing him from one of her friends.  Yeah.  Truth be told, the nicest girl I met was a lesbian.  Despite all this, or maybe in part because of it, hanging out with the Chesterton girls was really fun. I also saw some amazing show choirs.  I won't bore you with details, except to say that the 2nd place group did all music by Journey and it rocked.  Also Kevin and Donald from Moby Dick were in the fourth place choir, and Kevin tried to show up the Ben Davis flip guy, but fell short.  Literally. We ended up getting 9th out of 16, which is really not bad for us.  Hip Street got 6th and won best tech crew, and Ben Davis got 2nd.  Ming Chan suprised everyone by getting best female performer, despite not having any solos or being featured in any way. More later when I have time.  It's good to be back.   By the way, if you want to see our shows, we're doing them for the last time ever on Wednesday at 7:00.  Price is $2.00.  It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.
