         This is the last post to utilize the stupid and tedious alphabetical title scheme.  My next post wil began a totally new scheme.  But I've finally figured out what my regular section will be: Match up of the week.  This week:  Who would win in a jousting match between Helen Keller and Larry the Cucumber if Larry was riding a giant corn chip with legs and Hellen Keller was riding a potato chip of equal size with wheels? (They are both using chocolate lances, but Helen Keller's is dark chocolate and Larry's is milk chocolate)  Most of the matches will pretty much be like that.  Also, "of the week" does not mean there will be one each week.  There will still be one per entry, regardless of how they spread across weeks.  Erin, please read the comments on the posts for information about your books.  Do you think I could borrow Monstrous Regiment if I promise to read it quickly?  (Easy enough.  TH White is good, but his books take signifigantly longer to read than Terry Pratchett, whose books I have more than once read in a single night)  Also, I am surprised that Celebration is coming here again.  Pleasantly surprised though.  And this time, we'll get organized enough to enter the costume contest for real. I'd like to conclude with the word Eggplant.  But I won't, because this sentence is here.   Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!
