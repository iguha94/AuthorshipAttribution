         Above quote is from an interview with the author of I am the Cheese and its a great book and i just think that sounded cool and I want to read all of this other books. Tell me if they're good if you've read any. Sorry for all of the 'and's and stuff I'm kinda tired. I havent posted in a while because Marten ish always on so this might be a little long and boring. Alrighty then, the whole Larry thing started because Thomas didn't want to be called Tommy and he said that if i called him Tommy then he would call me Larry just to bug me but it doesn't bug me too much so I'm trying to get my other friends to call me Larry as well but they either forget or they just don't want to for some reason. =p So far only Pixy calls me that but i think its because he wants to be my boyfriend. wohoo im rambling!! Is it just FCV or do all band rooms smell like socks and old Saltine crackers? I seem to be the only person who gets a little screwed up in the head after jazz band but its probably because everyone else is used to it. I now regret not trading my bass guitar in for the mushroom shaped one. It was really pretty and i could've traded my Westone for it but I didn't so now I want it but I have to wait until next year to trade. BTW whats wrong with gossip?!?! Some gosip can be good gossip! Most everything I say is gossip anyways...  (sry for all the 'I's I didn't capitalize in the haste of writing this post) SQuEE! what are we revolting against my brother for? he could take us all off the member list and we wouldnt be able to post anymore...
