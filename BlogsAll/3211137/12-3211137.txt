                  Since you say my comments are inane, I've decided to address an issue of the utmost importance.  Something that's really been bothering me lately.  Linear time makes no sense.            Most of you have probably grown up with linear time, and don't know it any other way, so you'd probably be opposed to changing it.  And I'm not suggesting everyone be aware of all points in time simultaneously.  That would be mass chaos.  What I'm suggesting is that it makes more sense for people to control their own personal time.         Whether we want it to or not, the next thing to happen will happen next.  Friday will come after Thursday.  Two o'clock will come after one o'clock.  Causes will have immediate effects.  What if you had control over this.  Imagine if you could decide that you'd be in SRT than in biology class.  SRT would still come after biology, but you would perceive it as coming before.  If you put something in your pocket in Biology class, it would still be there in SRT.  It's just your perception of events that would change.        You may complain this would cause paradoxes.  Well, it would.  But only if used irresponsibly.  If overused it would get quite confusing.  The other danger would be the thrill seeker who lived every fun moment immediately and then had only sorrow for the rest of his life.  But, if used correctly, this ability would completely eliminate stress.       Do you get any of this, or am I just rambling?  If you do, that's great.  If not, it just goes to prove that everything I think about that's not inane is insanely complicated.       Bad puns excluded, of course.
