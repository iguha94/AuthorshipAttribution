         Damned hypothetical questions! I've got nothing at this point.  If you...  1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve? Sophia:  probably something super-random...like tacos and ice cream!  [Actually, there's a place that sells tacos and ice cream at 86th & the Monon Trail in Nora. True Story --Michael]  Michael:  It'd be Mediterranian cusine -- Tapas, Hummus, Pizza, Gyros and...whatever they eat in Croatia  Jonah: Bagel sandwiches.  It'd be like Subway meets Einstien Bros. Marten: I'd open a bar. Maybe a cafe. Nathan: Fondu! 2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell? Sophia:  Books.  My personal favorites.  :D Michael:  Records, like in High Fidelity. Jonah:  Stuff like they sell at Spencer Gifts, only slightly more clean. Marten:Odd but useful inventions, like toilet seat warmers and icecream scoop heaters. Nathan: I'd specialize in out of print or discontinued merchandise, for a horribly inflated price. 3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be? Sophia:  Probably a criminal psychology book...about the reason people kill or something. Michael:  Sex Education...for virginal adults! Jonah:   Whatever the toaster story is or else speculative fiction. Marten: Satire and odd fantasy Nathan: Sci-Fi, disguised as reference 4. ...ran a school, what would you teach? Sophia:  Psychology. Michael:  Martial Arts and Bagpipe Lessons Jonah:  Free thinking - Kinda like Dead Poet Society Marten: I'd help Jonah Nathan: World Domination. Then when one of my pupils succeeded I'd be in his favor.  Or he'd kill me so I could teach no one else.  It's all good.  5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it? Sophia:  Yeah, like I know that.  Probably some stuff from musicals or something. Michael:  Really Bad Music. Jonah:  Some musical stuff, some classic rock, some Christian Rock, some instrumental jazz and a few original compositions. Marten: Jonah, you keep stealing mine! I'll add video game music to that list Nathan: Something totally new.  Something that cannot be defined by an existing style, but would start a movement and revolutionize music. The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!
