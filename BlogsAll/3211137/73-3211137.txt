         If you couldn't understand the last one take heart, for I have a new title scheme: Prospective autobiography titles!  I'm thinking mostly for me, but some might be for you guys or other people entirely! Anyway, the Pajama Game is now over.  Thanks to all of you who came, came to half of it, would have come if you'd known the right time and hadn't had choir, or were out of town but expressed a desire to come.  I appreciate it.   So, I've decided to do Marching band.  Or not.  I'm still not sure.  The marching band people make these great, logical arguments when I'm with them, and then the non-marchers make sense when I'm with them.  So anyone who cares if I'm in Marching Band or not (Marten, Thomas) send me an e-mail outlining the pros and/or cons.  That might help.  If I am doing and want to be captian I have to write an essay by the end of the week. I am really not keeping up on these match-ups!  But today I'm setting up a big match involving a walrus, a walleye, a wallet, a walnut, a wall, Walt Disney, and Wally from DIlbert.  The will battle it out at Wal-Mart.  They may only use weapons purchased at Wal-Mart and have ten dollars to spend.  I'm giving all inatimate object telekinesis with a three foot range that can't be used on people directly. MArten - most of us respond to stuff in our own posts, rather than sticking things in each other's.  In the words of some girl on the interdisc boards, "i feel violated... like raped or something not nice" Here's some context:   mrs.harrypotter: I dont believe i need an introduction... im well fairly famous    [medit] Actually, this is Kelly Marchant. Just letting you guys know. [/medit]  hey now how did you guys do that i feel violated... like raped or something not nice   Something to think about.  The Betty-one looks drowsy!
