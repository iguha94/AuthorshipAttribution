         Well, My titles always have a tiny connection.  You get to feel smart if you find it.      I was cleaning my room yesterday, and it was practically an archaeological expedition, only without nazis and hot British women. There were a few bits of alien technology; I put them up for sale on Ebay.  Anywho, among the artifacts, I found an old health assignment. It was letter I was supposed to deliver to someone who made a difference in our lives, and mine was full of synicism and young martenesque wit that brought a tear to my eye and laughter to my heart.  Dear Andrew,          In health we have to write to someone who had a big impact on our life, and i chose you. We're writing these things for recognition. You know, why they matter in our lives. We figure if more people knew that they were important, we would have less people committing suicide, or something.         The main reason i chose you is because you are a loyal friend. No matter what I did, you would always try to help, or give me encouragement. Nothing I did would matter, you would always be my friend. I hope it can stay that way. I also chose you because when I get mad I can punch you in the stomach without hurting you... Kidding!         Because of all of the above, I present you with this cheap blue ribbon. Remember, it's the thought that counts. I want you to give the other ribbon to someone who made a difference to you, then explain what the ribbon is for. If you don't, I'll have no choice but to not know about it. But please, don't make me resort to stupidity.                                  Your friend,                                          Marten Dollinger, your future lord and master, as soon as the world acknowleges his global control  ha, good times.  That was in seventh grade. Boy have I changed. mmmyep....  anywho, Michael: I have been getting angry letters about you.  It seems like your taking over the blog.  You need to calm down a bit, I've noticed that you don't post on WKoDhiB as often as you used to, and here I see atleast 2 of your posts between everyone elses. I think maybe you've already scared Thomas away, he hasn't posted since October. Maybe you can lower the post rate and arrogance level just a bit? Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!
