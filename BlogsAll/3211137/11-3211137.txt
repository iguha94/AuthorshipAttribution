         So much to talk about.  First of all, I just realized that I am really, really sexy.  Like, I-wanna-rip-his-clothes-off-right-this-instant sexy.  I am too sexy for my shirt, and for that matter my shoes, socks and pants.  I'm so hot, I could melt number 7 plastic.  Actually not really, I just wanted to give Sophia an idea of what her comments would seem like to other people.  Anyway, Socrates cafe is awesome, and Ms. Guthrie is so cool! If she weren't ten years older and already married, I would be in love with her.  I I thrive off discussion, and coffee makes me hyper and the combination made it so I couldn't get to sleep until 1:30 (and I tried to wrestle Thomas's dog, Taz, who is on a permanent coffee high).  Of course, it didn't help that Levi's friends were over watching Leeches! (the new worst movie ever) untill 1:00.  We threw him a surprise party; it was lots of fun.   Why not rent the Producers at the Moby Dick party? (Just thought I'd throw that out) In other news... WE"RE GOIN" TO STATE!!! WOOO!! WE BEAT CARMEL!!! YEAH!! It was really crazy after we found out, and everyone was hugging everyone else.  This girl comes up and hugs me, then she's like "Hi, I'm Ashley." We'd never even met before!  It was very funny.   And now, messages to the other four. Thomas:  Join the Blog!  Nathan: Interesting fact about Christen Neary: Her older brother, Stephen Neary aka Parrot Boy, also drew the giant sandwhich which until recently adorned Levi's wall. Sophia: As far as the hair thing goes, you're so hot I never noticed your hair.  Or your face.  Or lower body. (j/k) Marten: Shrell is not my word, dram is.  Shrell is all yours.  SQEE!
