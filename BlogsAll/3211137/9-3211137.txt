             Actually, there is no problem named Maria.  The problems are Amanda, Anna, Zach, and Chris, the people who DIDN'T SHOW UP for spell bowl, causing us to have to FORFIET THREE WHOLE ROUNDS!     Err.......... The worst part is, when ar last person finished in Round 7, we were in the lead!  If we'd continued at our average score, we would've come in second.  As it is, we came in Ninth, out of twelve, which isn't bad for a group that forfeited a third of the competition.  It's just a little irksome.    Seriously, if other people are depending on you, the least you can do is tell someone you can't be there  in time to find a replacement.  It's sickening.  I'm never talking to Amanda again.  This, combined with Romeo and Juliet, is just too much.    Ok, what else.  We got room assignments today for Branson.  Kevin Wack, David Meyer, and Drew Klages.  At the least, none of them have any serious hygiene problem.  They're not bad people either.  It'll be fun.    Now, to swooning.  Both Jane and Katherine have sisters a year apart from us who are both more attractive and more interesting then them.  So why am I stuck in class with the bad ones?  Oh well.  At least I've got both Webbs.   SQEE!
