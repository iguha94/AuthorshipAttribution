          Nate: Sorry about the cursing, but the first attack was baseless and the second attack was below the belt.   Like my least favorite post of yours, Maria, If you didnt spend so much time on the people, and just got to the point, I wouldn't be complaining. Especially if you didn't even know the people, u didnt have to list them. You could just get to your point of the post.  Jonah:  Well, I didn't know whether or not I should be sorry, you said you broke up on good terms.  Sorry about ignoring your problems.  Lara:  um, wait for the band folks.  I like your bass, don't trade it. And while I could just kick people off left and right, I wouldn't be left with anyone to blog with.  I don't want to do this alone, it would turn into a diary kind of thing with a whole lot of rambling about stuff no one cares about, and i can do that in my head.            Maybe gossip was a bad word.  Rambling about people and events to which we can't relate would be better.  Like when Lara apologized about rambling about some guy who wants to be her boyfreind.  Of course, I should like to know more, in case I have to get my stick out of my closet...
