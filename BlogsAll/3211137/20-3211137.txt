         The title refers to the Blitzblog, and the confusion it surely raises among readers.  It's also a fun bit of alliteration.  So, first thing - the beginning of the conversation involved Michael commenting that I smelled weird, which is what 'point taken' was in reply to, as well as all of the shower stuff.   Second, all formatting was lost in the posting, but when Michael says 'with Claire?' (7:40:49) it should read 'with  Claire? ' folowing the unwritten rule that Michael cannot mention Claire's name without italics. Third- The correct terms for referring to people's mothers: Mine and Nathan's- Carol, Jonah's Mommy, or Ms. Hornbeck (Not Ma Comstock or any variant) Thomas's- Mrs. Fowler, Momas, or Mhomas (Not Tommy! Shlamme's! Mommy!) Michael's- Mrs. Christie, possibly Bonnie Fourth- There is no fourth item.  Anyway, news from the other side of the corndog.  I know how to use the template well enough to not only add links, but add a totally seperate item to the sidebar - Stories.  This will be lots of fun when there's actually more than one. But Marten- this is proof that you should give me mod power so I can make cool, trendy stuff for our sidebar, or just add my blog to the links.  Also, Who thinks I should change the name to 'Tales from the other side of the cornblog?'  And Now, a long awaited Mtto8:  Nathan:  *snicker*  Michael:  Loved the West Wing comparisons. Btw, did you notice how I've been spelling your name correctly?  Erin:  Yay! The war is over.   I feel like we should be tearing down a statue of someone.  Lara:  Welcome back, how's the book selling?  Thomas:  Actually, Spinachs do have livers.  Atleast, they cloned one that does in a secret lab in Montana.  Sophia:  Michael's already mad enough at me for inviting two additional people, so it's his call.  I don't like it. I don't like it at all. Well maybe a little.  But it smells wierd.
