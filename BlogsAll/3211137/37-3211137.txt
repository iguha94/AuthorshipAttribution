         Shoutout to Jonah for being the only one to listen to obvious and simple instructions. And Shoutout to Herman Miller for the new Aeron Chair. Y'all are cool people.  Apparently all of you have fallen and hit your head on something hard.  If you check Compendium today GET! ME! AN! EMAIL! JournalCon shuts down in less than 8 hours. So if I get nothing in my inbox, your done.  It's all over but the bleeding, people  Also (Especially Erin and Sophia) need to read the Daily Updates at What Kind of Day Has It Been. This is my last chance to pimp out my site before departure tomorrow so I'm taking it. GO   HERE  NOW!  And also add "prolly" , "nurr", "Cya"  and "WoRdS wItH rAnDoM CaPiTaLiZaTiOn" to the Echelon list of words that annoy Michael. Although my pointing that out will probably just make you say them more.  And Marten, the word "subjugate" will forever be dirty in my mind.  And Thomas, Sorry if I appeared dodgy, I thought you wanted one of my Twizzlers. And You would have had to have pried them out of my cold dead hands! And Sophia, I believe the quote is a misinterpretation of one of Maya Angelou's poem. The one where she's got oil wells digging in her back yard. Yeah, that one. (if you were in my 9H English class during the interpretive reading of that poem you saw Taylor Sheridan groping himself. Yeah, I wish I had missed it too.)  Does my sexiness offend you?
