         I've got a massive splitting headache right now. The stupidest kid in an Algebra class chock full of stupid kids stole my special pen that Jonah gave me. I have to stay after school for Math Tutoring and ride the activity bus home, thanks to a deal with the  Federales . My name is Michael, and today is one of the longest days of my life.  Clever opening, huh? LC was interesting today, there was a house fire over by Harrison Hill and the smoke was being pumped into the ventilation system. Naturally, we smell smoke while in the Scene Shop. So we're freaking out because the scene shop is filled with paint (that's flame retardant, but still...), muslin, and a whole lot of wood. So we freak out until they find the source of the problem, namely the housefire on 56th St. We all had a good laugh about it afterwards. And by 'good laugh', I mean, not so much with the laughing, but more with the loud talking.  I'm ready to declare Hall Sweeps a massive failure. Teacher's aren't locking their doors. Students are being missed by the metaphorical "brooms". So it's a yet another spectacular failure by the LC Admistration that will go down in the Hall of Really Bad, Stupid, Ill-Concieved Ideas with   Edsels   and   The New Coke     Claire IMed me again last night and said "I think you're cute and I've had fun talking to you and I'd like you to ask me out." Okay, I totally added those last two, but she did say that she thought I was cute, which is a big deal...for me...  Eh...It'd never last.   LC/LN romances   never end up working out. Especially if you end up dating a girl who types with her face.  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.
