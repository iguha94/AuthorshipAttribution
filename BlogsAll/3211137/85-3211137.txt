         Hey guys!  I'm sorry it's been so incredibly long since I've last updated...I've been pretty busy as you can tell.    Anyway, I'm assuming that the Comstocks made Jekyll and Hyde...?  I know The Pirate King did.  Good Job!  Mr. Stafford said that I was one of the people on the list of names of those they wanted, but when it came down to it, I just had too many conflicts.  Poo.  I really wanted to be in it!  But it makes me feel better to know that I didn't make it because of my soccer schedule and not because I have no talent.  Recently I went back to Fall Creek Valley with Central Sound.  It brought back a lot of memories.  I saw Mr. Rawlinson...he didn't remember me, but that's okay!  "Faster Pace, Higher Level, Pay Attention to Detail!" ha!  Mrs. Springer was running around the school...she remembered me, so that made me happy!  She still has the Anne Frank quote on the giant pencil above her door, and the students just recently did the poems...I remember Jonah's rendition of "The Raven."  That was some great stuff!  I heard that Mrs. Williams has cancer or something, so she's gone now...sad.  Sixth grade English and Literature would never have been the same without her!  Oh, and tell me why when I got home that night I started downloading some School House Rock songs?  Yay Mr. Harvey!  That's all for now kids!  I've gotta get some last minute memorizing in for my drama final!  The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.
