         Marten, was this one of those "Hey, Thomas do you think?" polls? 'Cause Nate and I don't remember being polled either.  As long as I'm posting, it's time for the State report-LN version.  We recieved 6th place, a seemingly bad spot.  In fact, though, we were 2nd place in marching to Avon by 3/4 of a point and third in music.  We were only 6th because we were eighth in general effect, and that could be attributed to our band being very small compared to the others.  This made us too quiet for the dome and ruined the pianissimos at the beginning and end of the show, which contributed to the low effect score.  So really, the score isn't so bad considering what we had against us. We still should have beat Carmel.  But we were winners anyway, because we drink milk.  In other news I'm wearing a birthday hat.  Yay! And Now, Mtto5:  Marten:  Nope, didn't get smaller for me.  Also, don't tell Lara but I'm with you.  Thomas:  Now you write the LC version!  Larry:  Nice Poem. Also, don't tell Marten, but I'm with you. Also also, your new title scheme is Famous Chiropractors.  Have Fun.  Sophia:  I like your poems, too.  I like the second one better.  The first one has a few lines that don't sound poetic enough.  Nathan:  I will eat your soul with my spork of doom.  SQEE!
