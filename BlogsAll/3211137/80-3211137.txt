         Okay, that's outside my title scheme, but I had to break it just this once in celebration of the fact that our kitchen now has hardwood floors! This is very exciting for me.   Moving on, I have a new Discworld theory. I developed it while I was bored in Precal. I don't really want to disclose too much, because I think I'm going to write a story about it and I want some of y'all to be surprised. But I'm going to have to buy Night Watch. And for some reason I can't even begin to rationalize I've started to try to figure out the Discworld timeline again. Or, as I like to call it, The Glass Clock of DOOM. Especially considering that Theif of Time was mainly Pterry's big excuse for his crappy chronology and just made it worse.   Irrelevant spoiler of the Day: That's right, I know it's heartbreaking, but you remember Darth Vader? You know, the tall guy with the menacing breathing? He's Anakin. Ani falls to the dark side. Feel free to weep.  Next time: Where have all the Jedi gone? The Original Trilogy comes out on DVD in September, and the Episode III premiere is May 19, '05! Woo!   Let's see... what else did I have to say... Oh, yeah!  I'm bringing back the fanfiction recommendation of the week! And it will be every week! And it will be starting on Friday! ("You might not care, but I do.")  Sigh... sometimes I wish I had a life. And then I think... no, nevermind.  It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.
