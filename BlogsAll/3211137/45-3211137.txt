         I hate Mr. Phillipy  I hope both he and Mr. Hall get married to eachother and die on their honemoon.  Or it would have to be a civil union thanks to stupid President over there in Washington...I don't even know if THOSE are legal here.  Stupid conservatives.    Anyways.  Mr. Phillipys such an asshole.  I agree with everything you said about him because that's EXACTLY what I was thinking...he thinks he can read Cyrano's part when there are so many people in our class who could do SO MUCH BETTER!  He's an awful speaker and he's so random.  I hate him, I hate him, I HATE HIM!  I've just had awful luck this year with gay English teachers, have I not?    I CAN'T BELIEVE HE MADE FUN OF ME FOR SAYING "OUR" FUNNY!!!    He can't even TALK about accents, stupid Pe-ru man.  Grrrrrrr.  And the whole "Bless you" thing?  Grrrrrrrrrr.  You enjoyed my pissed off acting?  I would've thought it was quite funny as well if it hadn't been me he was making fun of.  Asshole.  Nobody makes fun of me and is still my friend.  Unless if they're joking...I'm good with jokes.  But he's not joking.  He's dead serious about making fun of the way I say "our".  Eat me, Mr. Phillipy.  (Now I understand why it definitely isn't a good idea to syndicate this...sorry about the profanity guys...and about the awful comments...just sorry for making you read all of that!)   Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!
