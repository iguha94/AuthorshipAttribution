         Alrighty then. My title scheme is just things that have absolutly nothing to do with my post unless of course you dissect it and it might have something to do with it.  About poetry, you have come to the right person. Marten, poetry doesn't have to rhyme, but its still fun to find words that do. Your poems are great already. Believe me I've been published. I personally think that the first draft is usually the best. It shows what your thinking at the exact moment of writing and that is usually the deepest point of that partiular emotion. Here's one of mine that I just wrote Thursday. I was listening to SOAD and I was so tired I didn't  even want to get up and turn off my cd player or my the light. I barely reached for my notebook to write it down:  "Waking Up Is Hard To Do"  5:00 Radio turns on automatically I pound my fingers on the large button on top It stops  5:05 Radio turns on automatically I pound my fingers on the button Radio still plays I pound harder Radio still plays I retreat back under my comforter Radio talks about  Sex Gays Enhancements Trends Money, money, money Sell, sell, sell Buy, buy, buy I shrink further beneath the comforter I hide I fear to face the cold angry winds outside my bedroom The radio is just a taste of what hides outside my safe haven My heaven  My lounge  My healing  5:20 I mash the button again Radio stops I roll over to doze in my newfound silence Silence.. When all are at peace  5:25 Radio plays automatically I try to shut it out Try to think I try to be at peace No success I wish to die I reconsider my wish I give into the Radio Set me free   SQEE!
