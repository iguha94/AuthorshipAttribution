         The World History AP test is really scaring me.  The test is on Wednesday, we still have 85 years of history and two world wars to cover, not to mention all the stuff we skipped along the way, yet Leonhart thought it a good idea to spend the period watching a video on and having a discussion of African colonialism.  In short, he's doing nothing to advance the curriculum for those of us taking the test.  Part of the problem, of course, is that the test comes way to early in the year, but still, we need to be cramming, not just continueing as if we had all year. Can someone explain to me exactly what these "Hall Sweeps" are?  I've heard nothing about them at LN.  Yesterday in class Leonhart was talking about African colonialism, and he compared the French colonial government to the SAC, saying that there was a ruling council of Africans, but they had no power.  It's worth noting, though, that Ms. Lupold consulted them on the changes they were planning to the Skip-a-final policy.  I don't know if she'll take any of the advice she gave, but still, they were consulted on something important. Is Erin gonna keep blogging here from Hanover?  I'm just curios, it seems like it would be kind of strange.   Vote on the Democrats, or you will have elected either Daniel or Duck man by default.  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.
