         Well, that was Thursday.   Oddly enough, it felt like a Friday.  That happens sometimes, but I must be careful not to think tomorrow a Saturday, lest I miss school.  Or, in this case, show up at 5:00.  Yes, I'll be at my school at 5:00 on Saturday because the esteemed Low Brass captians have decided that just because we need to be at school at 7:00, it's no reason not to come two hopurs early for a Low Brass Breakfast.  But it's oK, I can sleep on the bus.  Speaking of marching band, today was the last rehearsal before regionals, and I think we're gonna make state.  Unless somebody screws up. Which brings me to my next point.  Or rather, doesn't bring me to my next point because it has nothing to do with marching band.  And the point is: For whom are we writing this anyway?  For each other, for ourselves, or for a theoretical audience?  I need to know how much background to provide in an entry.  Also, I think I'm going to shamelessly advertise my other blog,   Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog.  It's not a blog like this one, I have Compendium and   What Kind of Day Has it Been?  for that.  Tales is a story blog, in which I'm writing an amusing story about toasters at the moment.  However, other stories will follow.  And now, messages to the other four. Thomas: JOIN THE BLOG! Nathan: I thought you weren't supposed to use this blog for ranting about your love life. Sophia: I never thought of you as any of those things, but then again I didn't really notice that you didn't want to be associated with us, so I was probably just naive and/or in denial. Marten: If you can't remember it it can't have been too important.  Also, if you could add TftosotC (what an abbreviation!) to the links in the blog, that'd be cool.   All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.  I'll say.
