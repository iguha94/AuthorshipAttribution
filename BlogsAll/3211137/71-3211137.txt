The Squid3188: that's why he bit off your toe Tofig36: he doesn't deserve mambo in his name The Squid3188: It's a family name Tofig36: I refuse to include it Tofig36: its also a name in my family Tofig36: we should shut Reuben up for good if you ask me The Squid3188: His mother was eggplant mambo woman the third, her mother was eggplant mambo woman the second, and her mother was eggplant mambo woman The Squid3188: it wasn't his fault he was born male The Squid3188: Reuben is still useful to us The Squid3188: he can take the heat when we unveil the machine Tofig36: drammit Tofig36: that bloody machine has just been one big thorn in our side The Squid3188: but I think we can get your toe back Tofig36: and then that bastard Reuben Tofig36: how? The Squid3188: you remember Shibs McRoudy? Tofig36: of course, he helped me get that car The Squid3188: well, he owns a device called a Mk 12 Watchaprug Tofig36: Oh! I've heard of that! The Squid3188: which can under the right circumstances grow toes onto people Tofig36: But isn't that designed to detect frogs? The Squid3188: well yes, but that's why they discontinued it The Squid3188: if you hook it up to a toaster and shoot it full of gamma rays it does the darndest things Tofig36: interesting, I never would have guessed Tofig36: How did Shibs get his grubby hands on one? The Squid3188: how do you think? Tofig36: Oh... it's like that then. The Squid3188: yep The Squid3188: fish sticks and everything The Squid3188: right in the middle of Wal-mart Tofig36: That poor guard and with all those fishsticks The Squid3188: indeed The Squid3188: but the point is he has one, and he owes me a favor Tofig36: excellent! Tofig36: when shall we do it then? The Squid3188: next Thursday? Tofig36: sure Tofig36: ok back to the machine schematics The Squid3188: well, I was working on assembling the aft frizzulator The Squid3188: and I noticed that we're using polyfumerate for the cogs The Squid3188: wouldn't poly carbonate fumates be more wind resistant> The Squid3188: ? Tofig36: true, but the polyfumerate will make  the deflemulagtor nearly indestructable The Squid3188: isn't that a good thing? Tofig36: yes so that is why we are using polyfumerates of polycarbonates The Squid3188: oh, right The Squid3188: suppose reinforced the polyfumerates with ubnium, just in case Tofig36: Excellent idea! The Squid3188: ok Tofig36: we could also use the excess ubnium to reinforce the Loanamatron The Squid3188: well, I'll go finish that up The Squid3188: no, it'll make it weigh too much Tofig36: good point The Squid3188: if the Loanamatron is over 12 kilos the whole thing we'll explode when we turn it on The Squid3188: eill explode The Squid3188: *will The Squid3188: we won't explode Tofig36: All that work would be gone... The Squid3188: yeah Tofig36: alright you best get working The Squid3188: indeed  -Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.
