         Hola Hola Coca Cola!  Okay, so I've finally got this thing figured out, and I will be posting on here anytime something stupid comes to mind.  Actually, that's a bad idea because then I would be posting about 50 times a day...Anyway! For my very first entry (woo hoo!) I'll just talk about my other day at practice.  Okay, here's what happened...My team and I were running laps and we happened to come upon some ducks.  My friend Megan decided that she wanted to catch a duck, so she ran to go get one.  Well obviously the ducks flew away!  Which got me to thinking...why don't ducks live in trees?  I mean, they can fly so it's apparent that they can live in a tree or at least stand on a tree limb if they wanted to, but I've never ever seen a duck in a tree!  And now I want to!  My goal in life is to see a duck in a tree!   Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips......that's a good question!  I think it would be a great idea to walk up to some random person, introduce myself, and touch their lips.  That way I can give and take germs and become sick and die faster than normal!  That's the best idea I've ever heard!...Or perhaps it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard...
