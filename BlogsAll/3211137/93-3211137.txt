         I don't think I've ever made this much more sense than Erin, except maybe durring our arguement about whether or not a werewolf would change while she was pregnant.  LuckEdc: Can you melt down anvils? MysteriousBob87: probably MysteriousBob87: i mean, how else would you make one? LuckEdc: well... you could carve it... out of... iron... rocks. MysteriousBob87: ... MysteriousBob87: no. you cant. LuckEdc: why not? MysteriousBob87: because. iron rocks wouldnt be carved LuckEdc: but why? MysteriousBob87: if they were weak enough to be carved then you couldnt bang hot sheets of metal on them without messing up the anvil LuckEdc: well, that's just the problem, isn't it. because you bang HOT metal on the anvils and so they could'nt be melted down. so where are the anvils now? MysteriousBob87: the hot metal isnt melted metal MysteriousBob87: its just hot MysteriousBob87: ive got one in my garage actually LuckEdc: but it would make the anvil hot, so the anvil would melt. MysteriousBob87: no it wouldnt LuckEdc: maybe that's where they are. they're all in people's garages. MysteriousBob87: you cant melt an anvil with something that isnt hot enough to be melted itself LuckEdc: hmmm... LuckEdc: point: marten MysteriousBob87: w00t!  On a side note, Blogger is annoying now! I want my links back! screw profiles, if they want to know who I am they can read the Archives. I sound like triangle complaining at the cartoonist...  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.
