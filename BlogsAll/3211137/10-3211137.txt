              Wow.  Lots to say.  First off, Sophia: you're safe.  On the off chance any of us try to swoon over Lara, I think Marten would get mad.  It's unlikely anyway.  At any rate, I'm going to do all my swooning at my other blog, since thats what its for.      Second, I've thought of two more broadway songs about time, so we can continue that discussion whenever you want to.         Third, Sophia -- did you know that two voice actors on The Lion King have been in The Producers?  Nathan Lane, who did the voice of Timon, played in the Movie, and Mathew Broderick, who played the adult Simba is in the revival.  Just thought I'd throw that out there.  On that note, did you know Zazu the annoying bird was played by Rowan Atkinson?  Mr. Bean?  I had no idea, myself.      Fourth, Why are my posts always so much longer than everyone elses?  You guys need to write more.        Fifth, It's Walky is an incredibly well, written, well drawn web-comic, and I highly recommend it to anyone.  It's nice to finally learn about Jasons past, and this plotline seems sure to provide action, romance, and maybe a little background info on the cheese.  Plus Joe and Dina's Battleship is gonna be really cool.  I hope they don't just forget about it.  It's also nice to see a webcomic deal seriously with the issue of religion.     Sixth, You're adding webcomics to my list of taboo topics now, aren't you?     Seventh, Dune! The Musical! is coming right along, and I will show those of you who haven't already seen them the two sample songs at the party.     Eighth, what the frell does SQEE mean?  Is it some in joke I'm not in on? Wish me luck at Spell Bowl tomorrow!  Bye, ya'll! SQEE!
