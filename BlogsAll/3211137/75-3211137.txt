         We should post the rules on a seperate page and link to them.  Then we should add some crazy, random rules like  Rule Number six. There is absolutely NO.... Rule Number Six. (Props to Monty Python)  Anyway, welcome Rachel.  I'm posting this from the North Star room, cause I have nothing else to do.  I'm eating mysterious popcorn.  For the primary, although I'm offended that you never guess on my match-ups and comment on this the first time, I'm going with the Palpatine.  I'll go by their plans for Iraq.  Bush:   We've seen his rebuilding.  It's boring and it's going too slowly.  Bill Gates:   He'll probably institute a governement full of glitches so he can release Iraqi government 2.0 to fix the bugs, but it'll contain new ones, and pretty soon we'll just have to shut down Iraq and reboot.  The Skeleton:   He'll make all the Iraqis dance for his amusement.  This would be fun, but would probably just lead to a massive uprising the minute he says "I sleep now"  Palpatine:   He'll likely enslave the populace and force them to build a weapon that he'll use to enslave all the other countries, and pretty soon America would expand and become the Earth Empire, containing every country.  So we can see that Palpatine is best because he will bring world peace.  We'll all be united under one government.  Of course, it'll be a government of evil, but sooner or later we'll be saved by Luke and things will all be ok.  So, If you want good seats to the Pajama Game, I need a number of people and a day by tomorrow.  Money would be nice, too, but I can cover you guys until I see you.  That is all.  I sleep now   Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...
