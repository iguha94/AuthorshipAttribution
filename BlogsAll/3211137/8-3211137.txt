         You'll notice a change from the regular scheme today- my title, while still following the scheme- has nothing to do with the content.  This is because what little content there is doesn't start with D.   Oddly enough Nathan DOES sound like a prep. By contrast, you'll notice I haven't mentioned my girlfriend once on this blog.  Actually that's kinda worrysome. If she's uninvolved enough with my life that I can neglect to mention her for 3 entries, including the one with the first letter of her name as the main letter, I probably don't spend enough time with her.  I've been thinking about that a lot.  I realize that I don't really love her, so I should probably break up with her.  Then when I try to, I realize I really don't want to lose her, and I figure I must love her or atleast like her a lot.  Kind of a vicious cycle, but I'm gonna have to figure it out one way or another.   Anyway, we took the PSATs (pronounced: pissats) today.  How boring.  I had a scary Jolly Rancher experience and ate some cookies, and that's about it.  Oh yeah, and I'm writing about the Regime at State for North Star, and I also designed a killer feature page on Halloween.  I'm becoming quite the trendy designer, if I do say so myself. And Now, MTTO5  Thomas:   Maybe you're name scheme could be that all your entries are called Welcome to Fred.  It'd be funny.  Nathan:  Way to stand up for yourself! You can post whatever the shrell you want.  Marten:  Sorry I just used your word.  Sophia:   You know I'd be swooning if I didn't have a girlfriend.  Lara:   Welcome to the blog.    i33nbS
