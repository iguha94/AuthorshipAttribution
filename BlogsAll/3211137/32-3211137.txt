          Knote: Bekause of the alphabetikal kontinuity of this entry, kreative spellings are konstantly kalled upon  Wow.  I expected more komplaints.  Thomas, Soph, and Marten liked it, Lara didn't komplain, and I don't even know if Erin read it.  I'm still the center of attention, so I'm happy.  However, just for fun, a list of komplaints I half expected to recieve.  I reached ten posts a long time ago and I didn't get a Jubilee! Jubilee is a 25th anniversary anyway. Those are elephants!?! (Okay so I did get that) I never said/sung/rapped that! I would never rap, period. I got shafted because my speech was 90% static! When did Lara write a book? Like you know Laurence Fishburne. Ha! Diddo for J-Lo. and, last but not least, Laurence didn't say "Sip Responsibly" once!  Luckily you didn't komplain so I don't have to answer those.  Anyway, great fun all around and now back to regularly scheduled entries.  And Now Mfto7 (Yep, it says 7)  Marten:   I assume the "most" in "most of that is pretty klose to what would happen if Laurence Fishburne interviewed us" refers to the rap.  Soph:   I think you write your poetry better than I do.  Nathan:  It's more a live elephant  koncept.   Thomas:  It wasn't really that random.  You knew it was koming.  Lara:  You have to make the celebration yourself, y'know.  It ain't easy. And the doomspork is used to eat souls.  Erin:  Welcome to the blog.  Good job on the play.  I don't think you should share title schemes, get your own ASAP:)  Laurence:  Thanks for hosting the show buddy, I owe you one. SKWEE!
