         Just to keep this from degrading into a warzone, I'm going to agree not to mention any other people in my blog whatsoever.  Unfortunately, this limits my choice of topic somewhat.  I think I'll talk about one of my favorite inanimate objects: My useless couch. (Technically, it's actually a 'loveseat', but I hesitate to say that, lest my mention of love be interpreted as a complaint that I don't have a girlfriend and hence be percieved of as 'gossip')  It's made of leather and it has a massive gash in it.  I ripped it myself, several years ago, prompting Dad (I mention him despite that he's another person, please don't interpret this as 'gossip') to want to throw it away, but I convinced him to let me put it in my room.  I have since not sat on it once.  This pointless, boring story is exactly what it sounds like, and is typical of how interesting something can be when it contains no people.  But, I wouldn't want you to think of it as 'gossip'. I'd be interested to see your choice of literature.  Pretty much every book I've read and every movie I've seen has contained people you don't know, so I think you'd consider it pretty boring.  Shakespeare?  Terry Pratchett?  Star Wars?  Bunch of 'gossip'.  Come to think of it, Marten, so is the History you're so fond of.  I don't know anyone who lived back then, do you?  By your definition, wouldn't that make it 'gossip'? By the way, I'm gonna need you're guy's help with an Etymology project over fall break, anyone who can come.  We're going to film a scene from Beowulf (an old English bit of 'gossip' about a guy you don't know) and dub it over in old English.  I might decide to use a scene from an old movie though.  I'll keep you posted.  There are other interesting projects going on, many of which I think you'd want to hear about, but since they involve people you don't know, you'd just call them 'gossip'. SQEE!
