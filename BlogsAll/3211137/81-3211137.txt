         I'm back!!! So the trip to Florida was full of Comstock-like hilarity, some of which will soon surface on Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog.  When we actually got to Florida, there were many Comstocks and therefore much more hilarity, including: -My cousin David who brought his girlfriend to meet the Comstocks after only nine months of dating. -My cousin Paula's husband, Georgio, whose English is very good, but is still week enough to lead to several amusing translation stories. -The quote "I feel like a lizard!" actually making sense. -The mysterious "mini golfing" trips. I also went shopping, and my aunt paid as her b-day present to me.  I got: Newsies on DVD, Silly Songs with Larry on CD, and the Moulin Rouge soundtrack (which sucks, because they axed good songs that were in the movie in favor of "Moulin Rouge inspired" crap by "popular" artists).   I'm happy to report that my cousin Paula in Italy is going start reading TftosotC and, possibly, by extension, CoS.  That is, when she gets a computer in her new house, which is the next priority after running water and a bed.  So that means international readership for Jonah!  By the way, thank you very much Michael for ruining my joke, which Erin actually seemed to be buying. And speaking of Erin, as soon as I finish posting I will go over to Fanfiction.net and start reading!    BTW, I loved Monstrous Regiment.  Can Nathan read it before I return it?   It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.
