         Erin - Wow, that takes me back.  That injoke probably predates my relationships with Marten, Thomas, and Michael (I don't actually remember when I met Sophia).  Do you remember Levi's hardwood floors website?  Anyway, I found out via Michael that there is a Moulin Rouge soundtrack II which has all the good stuff missing off the first one.  If anyone is ever looking for something to buy me that might be worth bearing in mind.  I never gave you the update on the watermelon vs a slightly larger watermelon in a pole-vulting competition.  Well, neither watermelon has arms, so the real question is, will the extra size increase the thrust of the watermelon or just add dead weight.  Of course, the larger watermelon can hold a bigger pole, which would get it higher.  So the verdict is the slightly larger watermelon.  I'll conclude with a shameless advertising plug of : The Pajama Game! Your school doesn't have a musical, so come to ours.    SEE:  A knife throwing exhibition by the amazing Vernon Hines! THe best Tropical Spanish nightclub in Cedar Rapids, Iowa! Everybody dressed for the fifties! People losing their pants to humorous effect!  HEAR:  A man singing a duet with a tape recorder! A random middle of the show number that rivals Cabin Fever! "I love you"... in morse code!  WITNESS:  The titanic struggle for Pajama Survival! You won't want to miss...  THE PAJAMA GAME  Coming soon to a Lawrence North near you! April 17 @ 7:30 and April 18 @ 2:00   It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.
