         I've officially decided to stop including people's names in this title scheme.  I am posting to say that we appear to have been   copied!  They want to make sure we aren't offended, so if anyone is, post and let me know.  Otherwise they officially have our okay.  Others of you are probably wondering who they are.  One is Nate's girlfriend.  The other two are not. Also: Resolving the "Wal" match-up. "today I'm setting up a big match involving a walrus, a walleye, a wallet, a walnut, a wall, Walt Disney, and Wally from DIlbert. The will battle it out at Wal-Mart. They may only use weapons purchased at Wal-Mart and have ten dollars to spend. I'm giving all inatimate object telekinesis with a three foot range that can't be used on people directly." I assumed the walrus ate the walleye right off.  Wally probably ate the walnut, telekinesis or none.  Walt Disney spent his 10 dollars on a pad of paper and a pencil, hoping to animate something vicious.  Unfortunately he stashed the money in the Wallet, which added it to it's own and used it to buy a sledge hammer, which it started hacking at the wall.  The wall collapsed on the wallet, killing it, and used it's telekinesis to hurl the sledge hammer at the Walrus, which was too big too dodge it.  Meanwhile, Disney used the little money he had to buy a fifty cent eraser, and erased Wally. He used Wally's money to buy a pen and paper and animated a wrecking ball to take out the wall.  Therefore, Walt Disney wins!   You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.
