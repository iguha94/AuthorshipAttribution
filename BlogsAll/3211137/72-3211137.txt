         For Easter I got the Pirates of the Caribbean DVD. Keira Knightley cracks me up. She does commentary the way I do commentary. Randomly.  In the past few days I have learned a great deal from visiting the Royal Handmaiden Society website. I'm sure I've shared many of them with you. Like that Ani can't count, and Yan√© is silly, and Hayden tripped over a nightgown and Artoo fell over a lot. They also have a music video which is really pretty and is scored with an instrumental song, but if you play it while listening to "Into the West," it fits with that amazingly well.  I'm in a good mood because of Keira and because Dex's Diner just got reviewed by Kazzy, a fanfic author I greatly admire and whom I review all the time. She must've been like, "Who the hell IS this?" and read my profile and checked out Dex. And the review was favorable, and the gods have smiled upon me. Yay!  I vote for the Duck Man! He's a very intelligent guy, really. He would be great at the job. "Mr. President, what are you going to do about the war?" "What war?" "The taxes?" "What taxes?" Actually, he probably would realize and acknowledge the existence of those things. And give money to beggars, help with unemployment, etc. But imagine the press conferences. "Mr. President, about this duck on your head..." "What duck?" "Can we quote you on that?"  If the term "secretary" is outdated, why isn't Colin Powell referred to as Administrative Professional of State?  Irrelevant Spoiler of the Day: Wait, I have to look up what I said it was going to be... blah blah blah... oh, yes. Do any Jedi survive the dreaded "Jedi Purge," or, as Thomas would have it, Jedi Porridge? Yes. Obi-Wan survives; I'll give you three guesses as to where he ends up. Hint: It's hot and sandy and IN EVERY FORCEDAMN MOVIE. Master Yoda also survives and gets as far away from aforementioned planet and the spawn of Anakin as possible. A wise one, that Yoda.  The Betty-one looks drowsy!
