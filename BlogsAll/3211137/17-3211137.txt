         I'm actually not Marten.  I'm the other guy who write's for this blog, but my e-mail's down so I'm using his name for a while.  You'll know it's me because I name my posts after songs from musicals (with the musical in parenthesis).  Oh, and also, unlike him, I can type.  You will know me simply as N.  That's the actual first letter of my actual name, and I'm not telling you any more of it.  Be happy you got that.  More on Wednsday hopefully.                                                                                      With much tolerance,                                                                                                              N                  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
