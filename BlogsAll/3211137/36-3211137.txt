         None of my phobias have names.  When you see the giant list of Phobias, it's hard to imagine they left any out , but mine are very obscure. The first one is the irrational fear that I've just walked into the wrong bathroom, characterized by repeatedly poking my head out the door to check the sign and occasionally leaving the stall door slightly open so I can see urinals.  (I realize some of you may not have wanted to know that, but when I'm ranting it's hard to stop) My second and much worse fear is talking to answering machines.  They're horribly misnamed, because they don't answer.  They talk, beep, and then just listen silently.  The worst part is, unlike people, they remember everything they hear perfectly.  Once you've said it, there's no taking it back. So, normally, if I call someone and the answering machine picks up, I hang up immediately in fear.  Sometimes, though, you just have to reach someone.  In these cases I'll leave a message.  I'll start talking, but the silence on the other end makes me uncomfortable, and I start rambling to fill the silence, until I've forgotten what I was gonna say, at which point I start mumbling and hang up.  After I've hung up, I realize how awful it sounds and call back in order to apologize for the first message and say what I need to say, but this doesn't always work as planned either.  So, anyone I call and leave a message for thinks I'm a gibbering idiot, and it's all the fault of those dram answering machines. Anyway, if any of you know or would like to make up names for those, please let me know.  In other news, Tales is updated.  Reply to Michael's e-mail already.  I want to change my links to   5-minute Voyager  and   Triangle and Robert  (I'd forgotten how raunchy PWOT was). And please, please help me think of a new title scheme.  Time is running out!  Wacky is filling your car's gas tank with 3-octane gasoline. Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret. (This is from T&R btw)
