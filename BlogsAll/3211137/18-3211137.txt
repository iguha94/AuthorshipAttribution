         I know that I post too much, but I still had stuff to say and didn't want to add to my previous post that was almost Tolstoy-Length.  1.) I italicize  Claire  because I happen to think that  Claire  is a hussy who isn't good enough for Jonah. I have no problem with Ashley though. She seems nice. Unlike  Claire .  2.) I hate it when people say LOL. It just really annoys me. I think Sophia has said it in the past, and I'm not trying to tell her how to post but I think it is one of those phrases that can only be said by girls or gay men. Not that there's anything wrong with that... However this poses a quandary, cause Sophia's a girl Not that there's anything wrong with that...  3.) I think that Sufferage killed Chivalry. I also think that if you have the right to vote, serve in the army, and have equal rights, you can open your own damn door. Unless the guy arrives at the door first. If the girl arrives first it's not my problem.  4.) I have created forums.  At this point, we really don't need them since no-one but us reads the blog. But I believe that discussion is good and that forums are better.  So tell everyone you know. Tell your friends. Tell everyone who has an IQ over room temperature. And Send them to our site. Write it down for them. It doesn't matter, just get them here. And then get them   here   Have problems? Objections? Rude remarks? See your friendly comments page for details on getting those to me.
