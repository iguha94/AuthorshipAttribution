         I don't really forget; wouldn't YOU all want to listen to a band with this title?!  I know I sure would!    Michael -Oh my goodness, boy, you are really funny.  I just thought you were a weirdo before...now I realize that you're a FUNNY weirdo!  WELCOME TO THE CLUB!!!  (the funny weirdo club and the blog club)  ooh, do you wanna know what would be so cool?!  If we started a club at school for all the people in this blog (cept the Comstocks, of course, unless they want to get bussed over from LN during random SRTs).  I don't know what we'd do exactly...but it'd still be fun!   Erin -lol I will never forget you dancing in your slip and make-up in the dresing room to that exact song (Chicago-title-entry).  And I super-hate days where I would be perfectly content dropping dead.  Marten -You're worried about me "going out" with Larry?  Lol, the "quotes" are because I still think the phrase "going out" belongs back in 6th grade...but whatever.  lol, well, who's to say I didn't start coming to the scene shop to chill with you and Katy and Lauren and such?  It might not have been because I'm "dating" Larry.  (lol, trying to find a word that works for us)  Unfortunately, that is part of the reason why I did end up hanging out there...but I really like it!  You guys are pretty cool!  And what the heck is with this pessimistic foreshadowing?  lol...well...maybe not foreshadowing...but you get my idea.    Nathan -Don't worry about the eating contest...I'm in a beauty pageant in my diary on TOD.  lol, so you're definitely not the most far gone of us all.  :D  hmmm...trying to think of a good signature.  Not working!
