         Math sucks.  I've just figured out that if it weren't for math, my GPa would be a 3.6 something.  I'm getting a D in Allgebra II now.  I've never gotten a D on a report card and all be damned if I'm gonna start now. Well, the play is over.  Sasha and I broke up, and I don't really care.  It's hard to say which one of us ended it.   I don't know what Randall's problem is.  He was cast as Lord Montague and Lord Capulets understudy, but Capulet quit.  We worked with him on his diction, but when he got out there it all disappeared.  Jazz show Friday.  Come see it.  I have a duet with Heather Haywood.  It will be fun.  Hip street's performing too, and so is the Jazz band.  Oh, and there's swing dancing.  And jazz.  Lot's of Jazz.  Have I mentioned Jazz?  Unfortunately, I already used All That Jazz. One of my IYC/Speech friends(Amanda, Soph, if you want to know) saw Levi's duo and asked me about the "cute guy with the goatee".  That cracks me up. That last post had a title.  I don't know what happened to it.  Plus my title scheme is way harder than any of yours, so cut me some slack. Michael, as much as I enjoy your posts, you're making way too many.  Try not to post three in a row. Marten, even if we'd had a tech crew, we wouldn't have had backdrops.  Mrs. Means thinks they're tacky. Jonah, I think more profession's should do that.  I'm going to make a movie about Janitors who fight evil blobs of Dirt. Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?   No it's not. it's Larry.
