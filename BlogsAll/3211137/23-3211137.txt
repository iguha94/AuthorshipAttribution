         Ahem. Yes, Michael, I did read the whole thing. After being awed by your brilliant mockery of my typos (I don't know-- Are we in sixth grade?) and amazed by how full of yourself you really are, I have only a few things to say. I don't care what you say in your convorsations. I don't care what you want to make up about Rob Lowe and shoes. But it is neither your place nor your right to call me a "quivering mass of indecision" or to instruct me or anyone else as to correct posting on the blog. You don't seem to have taken to that treatment yourself. And I'm interested that you had to go to an outside source to find sufficient means of mocking me. While we're on that subject, Marten, I'm curious to know exactly why you chose to share a private email with someone else without my permission-- with, in fact, my having asked you not to. I'm sorry if it's getting mean, but you're the one who told me to start it.  On a closing note, I apologize for the inconvenience to fellow bloggers. But I have no intention of moving this elsewhere, as I have no intention of being involved in it nearly so long as such a commitment would imply. I, for one, have better things to do with my time than trade insults on a website set aside for that purpose. I have no problem with both of us remaining on the blog so long as you know of the widespread desire for you to moderate your habits. If we are agreed in that regard, then let's all just move on. That's about all I have to say about that. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!
