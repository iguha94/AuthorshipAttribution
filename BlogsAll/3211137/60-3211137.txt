         It all began with a game. The best game ever. The "Oh, Snap!" Game. This game is simple and can be played by anyone. You do a movie line, then insert the phrase. Here's an example. ANAKIN: You are in my very soul, tormenting me. PADME: Oh, snap. That wasn't the best example, but it was the first one that came to mind. So, anyway, Michael and I were just playing that game with LOTR. Then we started randomly parodying it, which turned out to be something that sounded a lot like   The Shifty Troublemaker , i.e. hilarious. (You all would know that if you'd READ IT, but I digress.)  So, what we want to do is a compendium LOTR MST-ish spoof. The plan is for everybody who'll be in Indy on March 30 to go to Michael's house and watch Fellowship and provide commentary. Those who won't be there will catch up later. If you're unsure about this, well... Frodo: I cannot do this alone. Sam'd go (Dance Move) I'd go (Dance Move) We'd go (Dance move). But I simply cannot do it A-LONE!  [That was totally my quote. --Michael]  Galadriel: You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of Power is to be alone. I have to go, I'm being yelled at. Pointless EP III spoiler of the day: Padme's pregnant! Betcha didn't see that coming!   It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!
