         Goodness.  I think I might have died.  Either that or my computer did; it's been superbly slow lately and I've just taken to ignoring the fact that I hadn't read nearly anything on here in several weeks.  I'm going to try very hard to make this entry long enough to satisfy all of you critics and also to avoid the phrase "lol" to get on the good side of Michael.  Happiness.   Anyways, I finally put my answers for the 5 question-thing.  Probably not the best, but whatever.   Guess what I'm listening to!   Phantom of the Opera .  Yay!  I really really really love opera and musicals and all that jazz.  Woo, I love that movie, too.   Chicago , I mean.  That's a great movie and has a fantastic soundtrack.  I just wish I could sing like that.   And, Erin, your underwear-thing-story was fantastic.  I super-loved it because it sounds like so much fun.  I wish my family were like that.  Haha, grandma underwear.   Goodness gracious, how am I supposed to have anything worthwhile to say?  I really...uh...don't like Mr. Phillipy?  How's that?  And, Marten, your hair looked pretty today.  Hehe, nice and wavy.  Anyway, he seems like he'd be the guy who scores drugs for everyone, except there are never any drugs in musicals. He says he can get a "samurai sword" and some "grass skirts." Huh? What the hell are people into on this island?  (There are drugs in musicals, though.  The musical, Hair, has a lot of marijuana in it, if I remember correctly.)
