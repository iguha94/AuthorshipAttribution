         Ha! A christmas title with only Ws! I've still got it! (X is Next, I may have to cheat) Anyways, Merry Christmas Eve and happy Winter Holiday to you non Christians.  (If we have any; I don't think we do)  I had a very weird dream last night.  I became a techie for a scuba-cheerleading squad who traveled around the country in a van.  They ended up switching to regular cheerleading and then acting because times evidentally got tough.  Then, we were stopped in my hometown and I was taking a walk when I saw my dad at a magazine stand that said Comstock & Comstock & Comstock: Booksellers, Arcade Games, & Fun.  I was all like "You started a business without me?" and we was like "Well, you had to run off and join the cheerleading squad."  So I said, "Well, why Comstock & Comstock & Comstock instead of Comstock & Sons?" and he replied, "Well, If you'd been here you might have had a say in the naming process.  That's about all I remember. Lord of the Rings was awesome.  Particularly the Oliphants.  Btw, Trebuchets are in this season, so buy one for your loved ones today.  What better way to say I love you than a giant slingshot that shoots fire? Oh, also I have a girlfriend now, which marks the first time Nathan and I have both had girlfriends simultaneously.  I don't think any of you know her, because she's a Craig person.  For my new section, I have self referencing paper of the day, which is   "This Is the Title of This Story, Which Is Also Found Several Times in the Story Itself"  also, I encourage you to read "Self Reference, which is linked to at the bottom of "This is the Title"  I fell down the chimney onto a flaming goose!
