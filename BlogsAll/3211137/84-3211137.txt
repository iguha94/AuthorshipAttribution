         Hi, guys. I'm glad to hear that MoM went so well; I would've loved to have gone. And I want to thank you guys for saying I didn't have to-- that means you are first-class, stand-up guys.  Oh, dear. Okay. This is all I have to say about the youth group situation, and then I hope it's all done. The idea that religion isn't important to us, or whatever, probably came from my post, although that's not what I meant to imply at all. It's just that I went to Sunday School for eight years. I've been confirmed. And I've been in groups where you just learn the seven sacraments over and over, but then I've also been in groups where everybody knows the sacraments and we get to talk about more personal aspects of faith. So Marten, Thomas, and Michael convinced me to come to youth group and I thought, okay, these are people I would be happy to do that with. I feel really bad for contributing to the breakdown of the larger group. I felt horrible when Patty pointed it out, I felt horrible when Jonah pointed it out. And I do appreciate that you guys have to keep going there and have to find some way to make it work. The point of my earlier post was more to make a suggestion than to complain, but if it rubbed people the wrong way, I'm sorry. Really. I know you're all wonderful people, and I'm sure Patty and the rest of the people in the group are as well. I'm done talking now.  On a lighter note, Lookit! I learned how to change the thingy!  I want to STUFF the MONKEY!
