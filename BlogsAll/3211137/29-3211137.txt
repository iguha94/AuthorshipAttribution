         Micheal, what did Laurence say about textual montages? Anyway, these convorsations intrigue me.  Are they a Michael thing, or are we allowed to try our hand? Cause it could be fun...  Anyway, I've decided to make a series of movies: Indiana Jonah and the Raiders of Noah's Ark Indiana Jonah and the Temple of DOOMHOUSE and Indiana Jonah and the Second-to-Last Crusade We should do one for XL.    Speaking of which, the media has desensitized the public to the boringness of archeology.  Tomb Raider teaches us that it's a feild full of incredibly sexy women and fighting bad guys.  Indiana Jones teaches us that it's exciting and dangerous.  Stargate teaches us that every artifact you find is a piece of still working alien technology.  This is what young people entering the field expect to find.  What do they do when they find it's mostly just digging up odd-shaped rocks and guessing what they used to be?  I think someone needs to make a film and/or video game about real archeology. As far as my title today goes, it's a line from Moby Dick the musical, unless the line is actually "My men may call it madness." Either way, this one works for me. And Now MttO6 Michael: Either date works for me, I think.  Also, it's Sluggy Freelance Marten: I have no settings tab.  Find out why. Thomas: Congrats on GrandNats. Nate: Good work on the play. Erin: Ooh, it is a penguin Soph: You still haven't answer my last message! Also, the Mr. T comparison was very funny.  You get points.  Yar! This Be a Superball! \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\;O ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?--> O+ It's Bob
