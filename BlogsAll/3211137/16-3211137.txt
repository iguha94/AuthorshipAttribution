         Lol...funny stuff.  I love this name.  HAHAHA!!  Cuz it's like, Moby Dick...but they're "punk" so they wear Dickies.  HAHAHA!!! FUNNY!!!   Okay, maybe not.   Oh well.  Anyways...MOBY DICK PARTY!!!  Rent isn't on video...so we're gonna watch Moby Dick!  I'm so excited.  Yayness.  Anyways...hmmm...Marten and I had fun cleaning out paint buckets in stage tech, didn't we? Do you want to know what I think is highly ironic?  The fact that when I knew you guys before...I thought you were so stupid.  I thought you were incredibly dorky and I didn't want to be associated with you because that was how I was in 4th and 5th grade...but now, here I am, truly happy and having the best time with three of the coolest guys that I've known for the longest and never imagined being friends with.  That was quite a long sentence.  But anyway...I realize now that you guys were the awesome ones and I was the stupid, idiotic, moronic, immature (shall I continue?), butt-headed, (okay, blanking on more mean words I can use to describe my 4th/5th grade self) one.  So I just wanted to say...I think...that you guys are the awesome-est and I'm just so happy that I finally got to know you and realized how incredible you are. So, I'm done with my testimony.  Au revoir! All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
