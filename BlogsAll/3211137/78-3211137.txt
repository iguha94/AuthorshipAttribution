         Jonah-- Yeah, that is an old one. And all these years I was just waiting for such an occasion as this to use it properly. I do remember Levi's hardwood floors website. That was hysterical.  Nathan-- Congratulations on the braces! :)  Yesterday was one of the coolest days ever. Mrs. Horrigan has this friend who has done plays on Broadway and everything, and he came to talk to us in SRT. His name's Ben Davis, and he went to LN. He's been in Les Mis on Broadway and a touring production of Les Mis, La Boheme on Broadway and in LA, and Thoroughly Modern Millie on Broadway. He's worked with Baz Luhrman and he's met Nicole Kidman and Leonardo DiCaprio and Hugh Jackman and James Gandolfini and James Lipton and all kinds of people. He got a Tony for La Boheme and he brought it and we all got to hold it. I got to hold an actual Tony Award! And then he sang for us. Twice. He has an amazingly beautiful voice. Plus he was really really nice. How cool is that?  Ok, I lied about having the fanfic rec up yesterday. I didn't feel like it yesterday. So it will be on Saturdays. This is all part of my grand scheme to confuse the new bloggers as much as possible when they get here. "You might not care, but I do." For this week's rec, I decided to buck tradition and go with something non-Star Wars. And I've been talking about Discworld a lot lately, so it's not that either. Instead, it is a Chicago one-shot called "Somebody Got Murdered." It's on good old ff.net. It talks about the various violent crimes committed by the six merry murderesses and the sweetest little jazz killer. It's actually very good as far as characterization and mood, even though it's a songfic, which I usually hate.  It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.
