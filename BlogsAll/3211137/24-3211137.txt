         Erin,  My response is in two parts, you paranoid shiksta feminista. First the part where I mock you mercilessly, then the other part. Keep reading. If you can’t scroll down any farther, then close your eyes and think of England, sweetie. It gets better.  Yeah, it's been a week or so and Michael Christie is still getting on my nerves. [A week? Honey, that’s like seconds in Michael Time! I’ve been getting on people’s nerves for years! It’s part of my incendiary charm. –Michael] I don't want to be negative, [Little Late for that, don’t you think? –Michael] but I hope you realize he is taking over your blog and I would like to know just who the hell he thinks he is. [Sultan of Neptune! –Michael]  Well, I'm not sure if I was the only one who actually wrote angry letters or not. [Yeah, You really were –Michael] I don't think you would rat me out, [Rat me out? Are we in Sixth Grade? –Michael]  but if you want to, let me do it. Let me turn myself in. [Guilty concience, huh? –Michael] In a public exhibition [I believe you mean ‘forum’, the phrase is ‘in a public forum’ –Michael] where I can at least tell him where he is welcome to go. [Chicago? The Ivory Coast?–Michael] He might enjoy his arrogance [Yeah…I really do –Michael], but others don't. [Actually, they kind of do too…Once again part of my incendiary charm. --Michael] Maybe it would help if I knew him in person, but I don't and he doesn't know me. [See below… -Michael] No matter how much he thinks he does and assumes he is welcome to be an ass to me. [I’m an ass to everybody. –Michael] I've had about enough of that for today. [Aww…Sad… --Michael] And he knows it was me anyhow. I know he knows. [Yep, absolutely correct –Michael] Perhaps it was the Huttese that gave me away. [Nope you were the only one who doesn’t know me and it’s common knowledge that to know me is to love me. Just ask Sophia. –Michael] It might as well be out in the open if he's going to ask you to reveal that information—not something a nice person would ask you to do, if you ask me— and if he's going to stay and wants to be hostile to somebody. [ 	 Erin if you were truly offended by my conversations, then well, I think you are as dumb as most of the kids in my Biology class. Convorsations are meant to be taken lightly, and are not a real indication of a persons true being. My convorsations implied that you were bitchy and had a secret thing for Rob Lowe. I don’t actually think that you are bitchy or have a thing for Rob Lowe. I did not mean to offend you. I never knew that you were offended until I got Marten’s message. I pretty much knew it was you, because everyone else knows me, and knows that I’m obnoxious and sort of an ass sometimes, but other times I’m as cute as a little bug’s ear. You just need to realize that I have the maturity of a first grader, and that being sarcastic and mean to you, It just means I like you.
