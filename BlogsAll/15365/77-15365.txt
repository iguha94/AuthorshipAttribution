Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress and a great favorite of the Pentagon, warned his detractors that he had acquired about 60 tons of documents from the files of the Iraqi secret police and the Baath Party, and that the documents detailed Saddam Hussein's relations with other Arab leaders. He also threatened to shut down Al Jazeera and accused the television station's journalists of having been informants for the Iraqi government. "We will not allow this channel to continue its destructive work, which might lead to civil war in Iraq through their lies and the spreading of rumors, because rumors," Chalabi said, "are worse than killing." President Bush continued to maintain that "Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction" even as high-ranking administration officials said that they would be "amazed" if such weapons were found. Other officials suggested that actual illegal weapons might not be found and said that they were more concerned with proving that there had been a "capability" to produce them. Weapons experts working in Iraq claimed that they had found a mobile bioweapons laboratory; other military officials in Iraq were skeptical of the claim, saying the evidence was inconclusive and that no trace of such weapons had been found. "We came to bear country and we came loaded for bear," said one Defense Intelligence Agency official, "and we found that the bear was not there."

Donald Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, nominated an oilman from New Mexico to be secretary of the Navy. Two American soldiers were shot dead in Iraq, and people there continued to complain about the ongoing chaos and violence of the occupation. Doctors at Baghdad's Al Rashad state mental hospital said that American soldiers had knocked down their walls with tanks and then did nothing as the hospital was looted. The sole remaining patient, an insane killer named Ali Sabah, explained that he had stayed because "I hate the world and the world hates me. I don't want the monkey to see me and I don't want to see the monkey."   Senator Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dropped his attempt to make permanent the broad surveillance powers granted the federal government by the Patriot Act, which are set to expire in 2005, and the Senate voted to expand the power of the government to spy on suspects who are not known to be associated with terrorist organizations. A German diplomat charged that the United States is turning into a police state. The National Archives announced that it was giving up its attempt to recover the famous 18-and-a-half-minute gap in President Richard Nixon's White House tapes. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy testified at his own bribery trial; he complained in an interview that he hadn't been to his house in Bermuda in three years, and said that he was the only man who could save Italy from Communism. "How much longer," he asked, "do I have to keep living this life of sacrifices?" A one-year-old boy was shot dead by Israeli soldiers as he played outside his home in the Gaza Strip. Israel was cracking down on human-rights activists, and it began to require all foreigners entering the Gaza Strip, including United Nations relief workers, to sign a waiver stating that they will not hold the Israeli army responsible if it injures or kills them. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon dismissed the American peace "roadmap" as "useless formulations that are not connected with reality."

Bennett gave up gambling; Mario Cuomo, the former New York governor, said he didn't see what Bennett had done wrong and pointed out that gambling is "not among the seven great sins or even among the 70 small ones." The crew of the cargo ship Pesca Well was under investigation in Panama for possibly throwing five Dominican stowaways overboard. "This case should be a lesson for all seafaring men," said a magistrate. "Throwing people overboard is no way to solve a problem." One hundred twenty-nine passengers were sucked out of a Congolese cargo plane when its rear door opened at 33,000 feet. President Bush appeared to be irritated at criticisms of his recent Top Gun moment: "Listen," he said, "it was an honor for me to go on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln. I appreciate the chance to thank our troops. It was an unbelievably positive experience." British scientists put six Sulawesi crested macaques in a room with a computer for a month and found that the monkeys, despite their affection for the letter S, failed to produce a single word but displayed a particular interest in defecating and urinating on the keyboard. It was reported that Microsoft is developing a portable toilet equipped with Internet access.
