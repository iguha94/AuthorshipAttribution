  						    FROM FLAMES   If there were an answer, then the questions would stop, and with nothing left to ask, only silence could recognize you.  I have reached to the stars, I have followed shamans to their sleeping shadows, passed the sighs of discontent, crept down stairs of sameness, felt the pains of misunderstood strangers wanting to be loved for that spark of light the others ignored in them.  I dusted them off  and shined them up, as though God cared for something cleaner than strength while night folded in on itself, while time marked herself with one leg raised and love rested unrequited for a while.  What's not to be afraid of for those who wait for even the first step  to emerge from the abyss or  their leg to twitch  towards liberation.  I followed that map to oblivion time and time again  until I realized it was only  a representation.  I gagged and bound my ego in retribution and drove past the dream of being more than myself by being the Self, the ultimate trip up down the path of illusory greatness.  Still the songs played on like trickling fingertips  on skin, light and playful and  wanting.  Still the lyrics illuminated the more than enoughness  of love regardless  of regard.  And night folded in on herself, marking time with man made clocks towards our own (un)timely demise or  time to arise from these flames like the Phoenix with brightly colored wings who flies because she can.  Flap, flap, flap.
