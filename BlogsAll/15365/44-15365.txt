           Abercrombie & Fitch Asian caricatures T-shirts cause outrage    (04-18) 09:42 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --  A new line of T-shirts depicting stereotypes of Asians has triggered an e-mail and phone campaign to boycott clothier Abercrombie & Fitch, which caters to the young, active set.   One of the Ohio-based company's t-shirts reads "Wong Brothers Laundry Service -- Two Wongs Can Make It White" and shows two smiling men with slanted eyes wearing conical hats.   Abercrombie said the shirts were supposed to be funny and cater to Asian customers.   "We personally thought Asians would love this T-shirt," said Hampton Carney, a spokesman for the company.   The T-shirts prompted a late-night meeting of Stanford University students Wednesday. The Asian American Students' Association encouraged calls to the company, and said Abercrombie & Fitch should apologize.   "It's really misleading as to what Asian people are," said Michael Chang, vice chairman of the student organization. "The stereotypes they depict are more than a century old. You're seeing laundry service. You're seeing basically an entire religion and philosophy being trivialized."   One shirt features a smiling Buddha figure with the slogan "Abercrombie and Fitch Buddha Bash -- Get Your Buddha on the Floor". Another shirt reads "Wok-N-Bowl -- Let the Good Times Roll -- Chinese Food & Bowling."   Abercrombie apologised for the offense caused after the first protest broke out.
