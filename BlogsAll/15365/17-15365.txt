  						    BACK AND FORTH   There have been truths told and promises broken over and over again like time passes through street corners summer has neglected and passed her judgment on before songs stop the conversations going nowhere.  The middle path is a reminder and echoes fly like hawks high above La Ventana calling me home as time is marked in different countries.  Over everything and nothing, no blame comes; the farewells are predicted in tea leaves, the strained voice of someone knowing there is nothing so something as the peach tree orchard of lost virginities and misled suitors looking for magic, rabbits dead in the hat.  The next song starts on speaker phone and she is beyond understanding his control or the drummer boy playing in the background without frankincense or louder still to drown out fingers stretching across time.  He asks her if she has found enlightenment yet or if she knows what love is.  In this state or that. with control, or without control, or with the knowing glances, the smiles at men with chests pressed out.  The owl that came to her on the patio looked in her eyes for truth before the matter was examined, and we heard the same music for the first time pretending it was not the second time this has not happened before or it was not the first time this has happened again before  air on the neck, the ceiling fan, the fan on the floor, the wind that calls from canyons in Farmington, secrets of not giving yourself completely enough over until the end.
