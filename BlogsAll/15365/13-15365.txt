  						    AFTER A DAY AT HOSPICE   How slowly these stages pass, how gradual a slope, and we too are learning while the summer passes by without our concern.  The days lengthen and stretch beyond us while we too  are blanketed by the nurses in kindness and patience.  With Grandma there are moments where she lets me know  with the grip of her hand, she is still here.  Sometimes there is a smile, beautiful beyond skies.  There have been days too where she has comforted me when weak,  my tears falling unashamed by my love for this woman who has given me so much acceptance and concern, a gentle respect for simple truths.  I remember weeks ago, hot from the walk to the Hospice house, I came to her and took her hands in mine. With silence she drew them  to her lips  to blow them cool.  This is love.  It is here I have learned tenderness. It is here I have learned care. These are my thoughts riding my bike home, thanking my legs, my heart, my health.  Home, I hesitate doing what would make me feel good because even the tension in my  shoulders,  neck,  face, reminds me that  you are still here. There is so little time now  for other souvenirs; memories made, forgiveness granted,  and night passes on to another day of lessons and farewells.
