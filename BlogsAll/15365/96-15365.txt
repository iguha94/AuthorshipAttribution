           Guru's Gallery :  "Once we know the particular shop from which we can purchase all our requirements, why should we wander among all the shops in the market?  It is a waste of time and is of no use.  In the same way, if we have found a Guru, we should stop wandering and do sadhana, striving to reach the goal.   The Guru himself will come to the seeker.  There is no need to wander in search of him, but the seeker should have intense dispassion towards the world.   A Guru is indespensible for a sadhak (aspirant).  If a child goes near the edge of a pond, the mother points out the danger and leads the child away.  In like manner, the Guru gives appropriate instructions when necessary.  His attention is always on the disciple.   Even though God is all-pervading, a Guru's presence is unique.  Even though the wind blows everywhere, we enjoy coolness only under the shade of a tree.  Doesn't the breeze that blows through the leaves of a tree have a soothing effect on those who travel in the hot sun?  Similarly, a Guru is necessary for us who live in the scorching heat of worldly existence.  The Guru's presence will give us peace and tranquillity.   A real Guru desires only the spiritual growth of the disciple.  Tests and trials are given for the disciple's improvement and to remove his weaknesses.  A Guru may even blame a disciple for errors he has not committed.  Only those who steadily withstand such trials can grow.   Even though one may come in contact with a Guru, he will be accepted as a disciple only if he is fit.  Without Guru's grace, one cannot know the Guru.  One who is really in search of the Truth will have humility and simplicity.  The Guru's grace will be showered only on such a person.  A person full of ego cannot have access to the Guru."  -- Mata Amritanandamayi, For My Children, San Ramon, CA: Mata Amritanandamayi Center, 1994
