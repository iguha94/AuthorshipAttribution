  						    HOW DARK   This dramatic ending was courtesy of T-Mobile.  Sixty seconds on Bradley's phone explained nothing.  I am a greyhound let loose after the rabbit, carting your newest disciple behind me.  Thoughts of this and who I am spark, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.  Back at home, wondering who this father he thinks you are is, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.  Pieces fly and the jig saw changes the shape on the way down.  I am powerless watching this story play out in not the way I feel.  And I question every question I questioned and the answers that sound different the second time rewound, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.  The line to you is cut and words can only get me into trouble later or sooner if I send them.  This is not my half. This is not my whole. This is not my job, my problem, my passion, my possession.  I am lightning. Look at the path.  I am the moon reflected in a pail. Look up.  All my words and all my sorrows have already been taken, and you don't know how dark my cloud is.  Go ahead and choose another title for this  meaning less.  It will take longer to explain the sound of my own voice this time.  2:55 AM Friday, June 27, 2003
