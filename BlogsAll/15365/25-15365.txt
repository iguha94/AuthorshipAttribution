           May 2003 Outlook from Moonsurfing.com   Dear Moonsurfers,  The Moon is New in Taurus on Thursday May 1st at 5:15 AM PST   http://www.moonsurfing.com/nm-ovr.html  for our monthly overview go to:   http://www.moonsurfing.com/mo-ovr.html   "The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do,  something to love, and something to hope for." Joseph Addison  The Taurus New Moon on May Day kicks off a powerful planetary boogie  that lasts all month long! This holiday celebrates Maia, the mother  goddess, and coincides with the New Moon in the first earth sign of the  zodiac, Taurus.  Deepen your connection with the material world through  your senses, your body, your possessions, and Mother Nature herself.   This is the first of two New Moons in May and the magic of new  beginnings, along with the pressure to take out the garbage, is seriously  amplified by the addition of two eclipses at the time of the Full Moon and  the 2nd New Moon. Be sure to sign up for the upcoming Telephone Seminar  during the Full Moon Phase on May 18th. You'll learn how to harness all  of these dynamic life-changing energies and have an opportunity to ask  me your questions.  As you take stock of resources and define security, and abundance for  yourself, you're building a base for your life to come. Earthly  practicalities must be tended to and here are the cosmic currents urging you  on.  A grand fixed cross squarely provides the kick-off and guarantees a  change in the physical status quo. The first leg is occupied by the Sun (Spirit shining through the  material world of resources), the Moon (emotional need for material grounding  and security), Mercury retrograde (encouraging slow, patient,  penetrating review of your consciousness regarding personal and planetary  resources), and Ceres (Goddess of the Earth encouraging you to nurture  yourself by communing and creating with nature) all in Taurus.  The next leg is occupied by Jupiter in Leo on one side  (inviting an  enlightened basis for security and wealth), Neptune in Aquarius on the  other (targeting areas of collective confusion and deception and shifting  perceptions concerning our humanitarian dreams), and the last leg held  up by Juno in Scorpio (bringing opportunities to break through to new  levels of abundance through equitable sharing of power and resources).   This cosmic standoff can be used for great creativity and progress or  to produce deception and gluttony. Chiron, retrograde at 18 degrees  Capricorn, demands we know when less can be more, for the long-term good of  our personal and planetary health.           The challenge and gift of a Taurus Moon is unconditional self-love and  acceptance. Never underestimate the value of your greatest resource,  yourself in co-creatorship with Spirit. Getting clear about what and how  much you really need to thrive can help you eliminate excess stuff.  This helps you reclaim precious energy you'll need so you're able to take  advantage of the dynamic life-changing energies in store for you this  month.              Things don't happen easily or quickly now. Plant an intention to  strengthen your patience and maintain a positive focus.                   Claudia
