           A glimpse into the heart of a dying star - Behind the scenes at a stellar chemical factory :  An image taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows one of the most unusually long planetary nebulae found so far. Scientists think planetary nebulae hold the key to understanding how the Universe became enriched with heavier elements so they study them intensively. It is not well-understood how a perfectly round star can turn into such an unusual-looking nebula.  {Apply this concept to people.}   Planetary nebulae occur in a huge variety of shapes and sizes. They are the final stage of a star's life before it ends its days as a burnt-out white dwarf. When it dies, a star rapidly sheds the outer parts of its atmosphere, creating a planetary nebula that exists only as long as the star has fuel to burn.  {Apply this concept to people.}   Stars are large recycling factories. Over their lifetimes of millions of years they process huge amounts of the lighter elements (mostly hydrogen and helium)  {apply this concept to people}  into heavier ones (such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen)  {apply this concept to people} . These heavier elements are then dispersed into the surrounding space when the stars peel off their atmospheres to form planetary nebulae. In turn, the heavier elements may become part of other stars or end up in planetary systems like our own Solar System. This dispersion process is therefore one of the most important in the Universe and can tell us something about our own origins.  {Apply this concept to people.}
