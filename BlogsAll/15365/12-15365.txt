  						    WORKAHOLIC   Another sun sets as you stab at your keyboard, fingers drumming replies to the boomerang burst of emails you must answer.  In only a few moments, the time for dinner will have passed, all movies will have already begun, and all of your friends will be in the thick of their plans for the night.  You may believe in the urgency of the greater cause the company has instilled in you, and the idea  of your place in this world from which there is no  clocking out.  So wake at dawn to work but know in the end it is nothing.  The time will come where death  will rock your boat, the loss of a loved one  leaving an anchor deep under your waves, and you will wonder where all those sunsets went and why you were not there to hold her hand at starlight.  You will find that all those trips for work meant nothing, are not even remembered, and even the money left behind is too weak to keep you floating.  Begin to tread now, and gather your strength. Pick up your sail and work with the wind this time, for love is more than greed will ever buy.  You will never be important enough or have enough proof of your worth through any job or any title.  It is quicksand to your self and no matter how much it eats of your soul it will never be full.  Forgive yourself the times you made others do your work so you could ride the corporate coaster.  Forgive yourself the times you couldn't be there because you thought you were too important.  Forgive yourself now for truth does not come easy and without a lesson.  There are many oceans ahead of you to call your home now that you know.
