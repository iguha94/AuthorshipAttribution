           TNT - The Power Within You  From Raphaela on 2/7/2003 11:41:34 AM   Stop bemoaning your fate and get wise to yourself. You have only two choices. You can either go higher or lower. You may take to drink or help yourself to a first-class nervous breakdown or wander around through the rest of your life, moaning about "what might have been" if you had only lived your life differently - but telling yourself "it's too late now".  But if you belong to that smaller percentage of men and women who have "gotten wise to themselves", you discover that it is never too late to get on the right track. You discover that you have been passing up the most wonderful force in your life, the creative power within, which has been ready and willing, at all times, to serve you.  A deep feeling of humility steals over you, and you lose your falsely assumed attitudes of egoism and self-importance forever. Once you are down to bedrock, you find that you have a foundation on which to build, that you can pick up your life again and make something of it, something finer than ever before, perhaps not so flashy or so gaudy, but so much more worthwhile, satisfying, healthful and enjoyable. Now, at last, you can decide what is best for you, without worrying about what the other fellow is going to do to you unless, perhaps, you do it to him first. There has come to you the inner assurance that whatever you need can and will be supplied to you by your creative power, if you keep in attunement with it, and direct it by right mental picturing. Not only this but you realize that you have been missing out on many things in life of far greater value than many of the things you thought you had to have a short time ago.....There is no way out, there is no way back, there is no other way but through.......Claude M.
