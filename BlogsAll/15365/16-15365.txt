  						    ON PURPOSE   In times of fear, we all fall back on what we think we know to be our strengths when our weakness  makes us more human.  In a robot vision of life, in step with the crowd or with those breaking free, all of the indecisions are abandoned for better distractions.  In the microwaveable vision of life, time is saved by not wondering purpose or planning for trips not yet taken;  and everyone has answers they are willing to share.  The meaning of life is waiting for you at the convenience store up the street, from the man you see everyday who may not even know your name or the brand you buy;  and everyone has answers they refuse to speak of.  They have a lot to do with that (w)hole you are trying so hard to fill.  So...  Dance to another man's beat.  Sing the lyrics you didn't write.  Stare into the photo you didn't take.  Creativity is for what practical purpose anyway or should that question anchor  elsewhere.  Creativity is for what conversation going on under the surface, projecting as anger or disagreement, or a million things not talked about because there is one thing still undiscussed.  What if you were the answer?  What if you were the center?  Commitment is  even harder to make to ones self than  to another when stubbornly, the dream refuses to let go when the alarm clock goes off, and  still nothing to do on purpose.
