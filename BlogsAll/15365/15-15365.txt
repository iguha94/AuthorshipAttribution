  						    AND THEY ARE OFF   I write without stopping like someone has shot a gun and the race is on.  To be fair, I allow for breaks this time.  To be proper, I forgive those  critics whose  jobs were to set me straight on a number of important details  such as;  creativity is all well and good but keep within the established rules,  and  love is a blessing even when you don't exactly have it in the way that you thought about it,  and hey what about a little fucking humor  from time to time to break through.  Because I have gone back now in time and read your words,  and they were not meant even for me here feet on table, legs slagging over the edge, cigarette smoked, and getting smaller again, as I am want  to do once I get too full of myself.  I am wiser now by far then the girl I was.  Nothing is quite so dark and grim and I never talk about hell anymore so it must be resolved.  I mortared many bricks to build this fine home using tools I was well taught  duty  loyalty  obligation  sacrifice  They paid the bills and brought me hunks of marked acrylic with my name in the center.  Let someone else get the applause. It wasn't all that and in the end less mattered than I might have thought once I awakened to the reality of who I was sleeping inside those realtor looking jackets and sweating leather flats I kept in abundance in the trunk of my car in case I were to forget to wear shoes to work again.    written 8/4/03 4:12 am
