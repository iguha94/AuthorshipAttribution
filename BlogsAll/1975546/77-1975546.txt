Distortion of Evidence  The President took the nation to war based on his assertion that Iraq posed an imminent threat to our country. Now the evidence that backed that assertion is falling apart. Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq in the 1990s and a supporter of the war, recently wrote, "Clearly a decision had been taken to pump up the case against Iraq."  If the Bush administration distorted intelligence or knowingly used false data to support the call to war, it would be an unprecedented deception. With a crisis of credibility brewing abroad and the integrity of our President and our foreign policy on the line, we need answers now.  Please ask Congress to establish an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the distortion of evidence right now. If Bush and his officials deceived the American public to create support for the Iraq war, they need to be held accountable.
