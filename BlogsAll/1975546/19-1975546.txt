Let's get the record straight about the 2000 Election.  After each recount Bush still won in Florida.  I believe there were 3 recounts: a machine recount, and 2 hand recounts.  At the conclusion of each one, the Gore team (not Bush) cried foul and appealed to the higher courts.  It was the Gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities.  And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted "to be sure that each vote was counted" had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a "man" Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               "The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of today’s Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president."   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.
