greetings fellow iconoclasts.  i live!  a drunk driver rear ended me wednesday night, totaling my wonderful little moondog, and leaving me with a 2-3 inch gash on the top of my head, busted up shins and an overall profound ache.  i bled for over an hour – head wounds are like that, apparently, and difficult to seal – until they closed the wound with 10 little staples.  currently, my hair is matted down with dried blood, since i can’t wash my head until tomorrow – gross, huh?  i’ll be on bed rest for about a week, and then we’ll see how i’m doing from there.  scary stuff, let me tell you.  it felt like a train had hit my car – the impact was terrifying .  i felt like a bug, squashed beneath the heel of God.  gah.  now comes the paperwork, and the doctors, lawyers and insurance folk.  hopefully my car will be written off as a loss, allowing me to get another one; safe to say that if this comes to pass, it will be another insight.  not sure how long i’ll be down and out – hoping to feel well enough for road to glory, but i’ve just got to see how i’m doing.  i think it's safe to say that i will be unable to attend the winter wonderland dinner, or allen's party afterward - the only way i can currently stay comfortable for any length of time is to lie down - but i hope that the festvities will go on and that everyone has a cool time.  talk to you all soon;thanks for everyone’s kind words and well wishes.
