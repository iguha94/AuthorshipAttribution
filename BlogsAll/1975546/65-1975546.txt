Here is my opinion on what is going on with the Matrix.  In the first one, the machines created a perfect world, but the human mind would not accept it, so it was a "monumental failure".  So, they created a second, less than perfect, world.  As the Architect said 99.9% of the people accepted it.  I think that the machines, not being stupid, decided to create another false world outside of the 20th century world.  This is for those 0.1% of minds that could not accept what they saw.  This new world allows them to think that they are fighting for the freedom of mankind and keeps them from noticing the imperfections in the world because Zion is by no means a perfect world.  In the end they are still just coppertops.  I think Neo is the One that can change the laws of both worlds, not just the 20th century one, which we saw at the end with the sentinels.  That is why he is so powerful in the 20th century one, because to him, it is almost like us playing a kids game.  Doing the math, if the 250,000 people in Zion represent the 0.1%, then that means that the population in the matrix is just under 250 million, or just slightly less than the population of the US.  At 12,000 BTU per body, that is 3 billion BTU, which will run a few lightbulbs.  Now, I have several questions remaining  1)  What is Smith up to? 2)  What happened to the Architect? 3)  Is the Oracle working for the System or freelance? 3a)  If the System, why help Neo? 3b)  If freelance, why? 4)  If the people in Zion are plugged into a Matrix, can they wake up?
