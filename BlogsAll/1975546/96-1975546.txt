Think of it as a family for a second.  My father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.  They bicker and argue with each other quite a bit (at least they did when they were younger).  But, if someone outside the family, even one of the spouses of the four siblings, were to say something derogatory about one of them, the other three will circle the wagons and defend the other, even if what was said was true or something that one of them had said before.  That is the way it is here.  We can bicker amongst ourselves, bitch about the government, and even leave the country for a change, but if someone outside of here tells us we need to change or attacks us (verbally  or physically), we will tell you in no uncertain words to go f*** yourself.  Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off.  However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys.  It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  As for the security issue, the same NBC report said that security was already higher than normal because of some intelligence indicating a possible Al Queda attack.  They actually had some British official discussing that briefly in the report.
