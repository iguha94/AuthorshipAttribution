Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.  My non-legal interpretation  It says Congress can't do it.  Somewhere along the way that got put on the states as well (note that I am not proposing that states should be allowed to).  Displaying an item in a public place is not making a law.  Keep in mind that the writer's of the Bill of Rights had fresh memory of English rule where the Anglican Church was the government endorsed religion.  I don't know what, if any, penalties were involved with practicing a different type of Christianity (or judaism or even worse, considering the English history with the Crusades, islam) or being an atheist.  Perhaps Nick could shed some light on it?  The part that always seems to be forgotten is where is says "or prohibiting the free excercise thereof."  Going down the path we are heading, churches on major thoroughfares may not be allowed to display their crosses or Christmas nativities because it can be seen from a public street and might be interpreted as the government endorsing a religion by having a road travel right by the church?  Ridiculous?  Yes.  But stranger things have happened - remember the woman who spilled hot coffee on herself and won millions of dollars from McDonald's in a lawsuit?  Once the courts get involved, just about anything can happen.
