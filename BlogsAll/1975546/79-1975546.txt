my fave song for the day: Aimee Mann - Pavlov's Bell    From the album "Lost In Space"   Oh Mario, sit here by the window  Stay here till we reach Idaho  And when we go, hold my hand on take off  Tell me what I already know  That we can't talk about it  No, we can't talk about it   Because nobody knows that's how I nearly fell  Trading clothes and ringing Pavlov's bell  History shows there's not a chance in hell   But, oh, Mario, we're only to Ohio  It's kind of getting harder to breath  I won't let it show, I'm all about denial  But can't deny all that need belief  That we could talk about it  But we can't talk about it   Because nobody knows that's how I nearly fell  Trading clothes and ringing Pavlov's bell  History shows, but rarely shows it well  Well well well   Oh Mario, why if this is nothing  I'm finding it so hard to dismiss  If you're what I need then only you can save me  So come on baby give me the fix  And let's just talk about it  I've got to talk about it   Because nobody knows that's how I nearly fell  Trading clothes and ringing Pavlov's bell  History shows, like it will show and tell  So tell me   That's how I nearly fell  By ringing Pavlov's bell  So baby show and tell   Oh Mario, Mario
