Bad Poetry   I want to write bad poetry The kind that makes you cringe. I don’t give a fuck about rhyme Or meter or rhythm Iambic pentameter, maybe. But that’s as far as I’ll go.  I want to write bad poetry About pain and sorrow and loss. Maya and teenagers haven’t cornered the market On being downtrodden. After all, What about the white, college-educated, middle-class male? We got our gripes, too.  But I won’t put any effort into it Unless I’m drunk Or sentimental. Which might actually make it worse. I want my poetry  To be the literary version of a Baz Lurmann movie. If Moulin Rouge can win an Oscar Who says I can’t be Poet Laureate?  I want to go on Oprah And have her kiss my ass. I’d act pretentious and sullen And lecture about my triumph over adversity. I’ll make Jonathan Franzen look like her best friend. And If I’m really lucky,  Dr. Phil will come on And I’ll kick his ass.  It’s about time I got recognized As the writer of my generation. Coupland can collect plastic bottles and design furniture, And Ethan Hawke’s novel will wipe my ass. Fuck Damon and Affleck Screenplays are for pussies.  I want to be Kerouac the traveler Fitzgerald the Hollywood-abused Thompson the twisted  And Hemingway the suicidal drunk. Pounded into one person From a 4 AM bar fight in Queens. With a side of Joyce for good measure. I already drink Guinness.  I promise to use vile, filthy words. Stuff I couldn’t say on the Today show. Things like smack, crack, crank, and blow. Shit, fuck, suck a duck. Prick, dick, sniggedy-wick. Give the dog a bone.  I feel better already. Now give me my NEA grant.
