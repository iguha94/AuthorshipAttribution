well folks you won't get any commentary from me for the next few days - i'm going on a trip - on a plane.   just a little song i thought i'd share to express my feelings about flying  up on the airplane  nearer my god to thee  i start making a deal  inspired by gravity  if i did wrong i won't do it again  cause i can be sweet and good and nice  and if i had enemies their friends  i'll hold to my life with the grip of a vice  and i'm up on the airplane  nearer my god to thee  i start making a deal  inspired by gravity  that little spot on the ground is my hometown  i like to call it my home and it's sweet  i'd rather take a seat down there  than a throne up here up above 30,000 feet  and i'm up on the airplane  i never should have read my horoscope  or the fortune on the bubble strip  saying what you think won't happen will  a great thing to read before a trip  on an airplane  pilot says the big blue sky's like a swimming pool  big fluffy clouds like a feather bed  i'd rather have a real pillow underneath my head  lying in my bed which is in my hometown  which is on the ground  far from an airplane  (my bed my hometown)  far from an airplane  (on the ground my bed my hometown)  far from an airplane  (on the ground my bed my hometown)  on the airplane  (on the ground)  [i'll be making a deal]  on the airplane  (on the ground)  [i'll be making a deal]  on the airplane  [i'll be making a deal]  [i'll be making a deal]  [i'll be making a deal]
