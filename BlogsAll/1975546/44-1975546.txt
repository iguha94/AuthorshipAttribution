The only arrogance I personally see in Bush II is his language which places him and America as the representatives of Good, capital G, and our enemies as representatives of Evil, capital E.  This kind of language scares and enrages me, regardless of the speaker.  Any other disagreement I have with Bush II et. al. is a matter of philosophy or economics.  As to acts of will:  I'm not sure that limiting another's options to agreeing or stepping aside is necessarily an accurate definition of non-arrogance.  Consider the State planning a freeway or landfill near one's neighborhood; it tells the residents to agree or step aside, and not to stand in the way -- after all, look at all the State does for its citizens!  Wouldn't the residents percieve such a policy as arrogant?  It seems to me that expecting (or demanding) no one to stand in one's way smacks of a kind of arrogance.  Also, I'm not convinced that acts of goodwill are points to be cashed in later when one wishes to act with abandon.  I may be wrong; perhaps in terms of history and foreign policy, they are.  Did we really defeat the Soviet Union, or did the Soviet Union fall victim to its own geography and internal corruption?  P.S.  Keep Angie in your thoughts -- the recent flareup of her fibromyalgia continues to cause great pain and sadness.  Today's visit to the rheumatologist revealed some new strategies, but no new information.  She's truly my hero -- anyone else in her conditions (and they are plural) would have given in to depression, cynicism, and bitterness long ago.  That she smiles and sings and laughs and dreams is a tribute to the depth of her courage and the size of her heart, and I'm not saying that just because I love her.  If more people could shine a light like hers, the world would be a far better place.  May we all learn that the secret to happiness is perspective, gratitude, and the love of a beautiful person.
