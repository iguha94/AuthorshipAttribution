a short story to prove john's point - and in case you don't know nick, i'm a flaming liberal  (at least for virginia)and john is a staunch conservative. (in a moderate kind of way) i was out having dinner with some friends and two exchange students from india.  we were chatting about politics and i started to go on some rant about something or the other and one of the exchange students started going on about how yeah, america was such a international bully, destroying the planet, didn't know how to take care of its own people and so on - all of which i agree with  - however, hearing it from her - someone who voluntarily came to my country to take advantage of the educational opportunities just infurirated me.  i told her that if she hated the country that much then i'm sure a plane was leaving for india sometime soon and she should just go catch it.   listen, this country tries me nuts - but hell, it's my country and i don't need no mouthin' off from somebody who isn't even a citizen.   and yes, i know that is a narrow-minded point of view - but it is what i believed in that moment and what most americans believe.  i support the british protesting a president i can't stand but i seriously don't think anything will change as a result of it.  until we in this country get together and start actively protesting this man will things change.
