from a   transcript  of the interview with Diane Sawyer that JLS mentioned earlier:   Bush also defended the intelligence that he used in citing weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as a main reason for going to war. Asked about the emphasis now on alleged weapons "programs" instead on possession of weapons themselves, Bush remained firm about his prewar assessment of the threat Saddam posed and insisted the world and America are safer because of the war that toppled him.   " What's the difference? " he said. "If he were to acquire weapons, he would be the danger. That's what I'm trying to explain to you. A gathering threat, after 9-11, is a threat that needed to be dealt with."    ...i guess the difference that immediately comes to mind would be the one between 1) telling the truth  and 2) lying.    what the fuck, bush?  is  that  the administration's answer to why we haven't found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?  that you figured we'd understand that when you   said  right before the war, "The dictator of Iraq and his weapons of mass destruction are a threat to the security of free nations",  what you *meant* was, "The dictator of Iraq is  planning  on producing weapons of mass destruction at some point in future, which  at that time  will be a threat to the security of free nations?"  added bonus: he managed to drop a 9-11 reference into a discussion about the justification for invading Iraq.    dammit to hell; enough of this.  i never expected to agree with the bush administration's policies, but the very least they could do is be straightforward with the people who pay their salaries.
