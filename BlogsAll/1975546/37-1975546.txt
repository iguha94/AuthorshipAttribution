not a poem i wrote, but from a publication i am interning for -   http://www.blackbird.vcu.edu/  i am hoping the mighty circle of irony master will link this to our blogger site - anyway, here's the poem - and don't forget, vote for me as despair on january 27th! CORRINNE CLEGG HALES Critical Care  She could be a puppet, blue strings trailing from the backs of her hands, her index finger, her nose, her mouth, even her crotch,   but her wrists are strapped to the metal  bed rails, also her ankles, and white tape  covers her mouth like a burglar's gag   keeping the respirator tube in place.  If she could see herself like this, splayed out  under a thin sheet surrounded   by shower curtains and stainless steel  and everything on wheels, she might laugh. But she is thinking now of learning to swim   in a slow, dirty river, remembering  how her brother dared her to dive  between his legs, and when she did,   how he clenched her head with his knees  and held her there thrashing,  hitting at him through the water   until there were knives in her lungs. It's cold here. She can't speak or feel or move a finger.   She can't even open her eyes. A voice  tells her morphine, a voice says curare.  It says don't worry. It will wear off soon.  This is all so normal for them— they strap people down and knock people out  and string people up like this     every day. They do it to save them.  The woman waits. She thinks she has forgotten how to breathe. She hears  someone gasping from a bed  behind the curtain—loud, clumsy breaths far apart, the strange deep brand of breathing   that the dying do—as if to prove  they can still do it, as if the air itself  might shake them back to life.
