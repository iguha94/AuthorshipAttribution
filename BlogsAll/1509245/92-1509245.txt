          Another night slips away  In other words i should say  There are no words he should say  There are no words   In his eyes i see the fear  that only time could re-appear  If only time could re-appear  Now’s the time   Somethin’ to take it away, to take it away, to take it  Don’t let it stay, don’t let it stay, don’t let it   The butterflys are passive aggresive and put their problems on the shelf, but they’re beautiful  He’ll realize the only thing thats real are the kids that kid themselves and the demise of the beautiful  What is beautiful?   The multi-life is better than  the one we’re in the one we knew  Cause everyone is seein’ through everyone   They’re steppin’ on  His gold terrain  He’s movin’ on with bold refrain  His blatently old campaign  Is movin’ on   Somethin’ to take it away to take it away to take it  Don’t let it stay don’t let it stay don’t let it   The butterflys are passive aggresive and put their problems on the shelf but they’re beautiful  He’ll realize the only thing thats real are the kids that kid themselves and the demise of the beautiful  What is beautiful?   What can’t stay goes away   It starts stopping when it stops stopping
