         *Do you enjoy pointing out all the negative aspects of your regular companions' penmanship?  *Do you like to bark at your lifting partner as if you are her superior?  *Are you four-eleven?  *Do you experience bouts of childlike behavior, followed by a long succession of insults?  *Do you like to zone in on one person and pick apart at her self-esteem until she has a break down?  *Do you like to regularly say, "You are a loser!"?  *Is your name Adrienne?   If you answered yes to two or more of these questions, then I honestly hope you fall of the face of the earth. Really.   At the risk of sounding like a total delequent, today Robin and I skipped first period. It was totally unnecessary. However, I require some form of adventure in my life. We went to The Rocket. On the dollar of my Dad, Robin enjoyed a Sticky Bun and I enjoyed a Chia Tea with soy milk. But more important than sustenance was the conversation, of course. There is something so beautiful about having a friend to be completely honest with. I honestly hope that everyone has a friend that they can skip class and pour their hearts out to.   We had a fire alarm later in the afternoon. Other than that, I was dangerously close to drowning in the Sea of the Mundane.  Affectionately... Anna
