         Photography is now my favorite class. Why? Because as I grow more into Slacker-dum, I find that I appreciate minimal classwork more and more. We took self-portraits today, and all of my pictures turned out hilarious. The best part? As long as I have the apeture and exposure correct, and as long as the pictures are in focus, I get full credit.   Pep con today, which was great. The con itself was a complete waste of time, but in a positive way: classes were cut to a half hour each. And lunch was extended to almost an hour. Highlights include Milton the Senior doing his (dead-on) Michael Jackson impression and when we were allowed to leave.   Anna and I decided to skip our fourth period and go to The Rocket. It's not really that big of a deal, though, because everyone skips fourth on days when we have cons. We played chess and talked about the strange attraction we each had towards the guy working that shift (not Rocket Sex God, I am sad to report) I had to pass my old Global Issues class when we snuck back in during fifth period, which was awkward. That perv/teacher used to call me 'perfect' last year. I think it would surprise him to know I no longer re-copy notes, let alone that I am skipping class. I'm trying very hard to be a typical high-scholar and not care what teachers think of me. And I am unsuccessful.   But, really, who thoroughly doesn't care what people think of themselves? I could kid myself into thinking I don't, but that would benefit no one. Especially not me. I do care. Everyone wants people to like them, to think that they are funny, to think that their silly little habits are endearing. Everyone wants to special, even if they want it in different ways. Maybe the preppy person wants people to think she is gorgeous and the nonconformist wants people to think he's hardcore. But nonetheless, each sort of person wants to be special in their own way.   Affectionately... Anna
