         I am much disappointed in my grocery shopping skills. I opted for a normal sized bottle of Adam's (PB for those not in the know) But to my dismay I discovered that I had indeed purchased the unsalted, trans fatty acid-free version. There is just no reason why anyone could ever want to eat that stuff. Really.   Milled around looking for something to do, as is the bliss of Sunday afternoons. I decided to go running, because I had not been running on something other than the gym at school or the tread mill for a while. I love to run in my neighborhood and completely zone out of all consciousness other than my feet hitting the precisely exact pavement. It's awesome. People call it "the runner's high" because it is such a intense feeling of nothing. I literally don't think at all. So there I was, being Zen like and just about to push past the pain threshold when...  I tripped over a tree root and fell on my face.  Those words make it sound so simple, so commonplace. I wish I could more aptly describe the embarrassment of falling from all grace in front of your neighbors. Picture some serious-looking red-faced girl in a sports bra and running shorts trying to be all sporty (which I most certainly am NOT) what with my attire and specialized shoes, totally eat sidewalk. So pathetic. And yet so wonderfully me.  Affectionately (and still bleeding)... Anna
