         I can usually spot a fellow music nerd with little evidence. There are the more obvious signs, the bands t-shirts worn to threadbare, the stubs from concert tickets posted in lockers. But there are extra subtles in the true nerds. These are the kids who race home after school solely to listen to music, not to watch TV or have a snack or even to get stoned. They'll listen to the same song over and over, trying to figure out what it does, exactly, to make them feel so alive. These are the kids who thumb through liner notes in the hopes of finding answers.   Music nerds are a unique variation on the classic sense of nerd. Music nerds are not musicians themselves, and if they were to form a band it would be of the tribute variety. Like the band-aid Saphire says about loving music in the movie Almost Famous, "They don't even know what it is to be a fan. Y'know? To truly love some silly little piece of music, or some band, so much that it hurts."   And that is what it is to be a music nerd. It's not cool, it's not scene, it's not hip. Being a music nerd means hugging your stereo, not your boyfriend, as you drift off to sleep. It means understanding Bob Dylan more than you'll ever understand your parents.   I am a one such nerd.  "Half of what I say is meaningless" is to be a diary of expirencing songs. It's not going to be about my doing drugs or boys or whatever my latest pair of shoes cost. It's about songs, and trying to figure out the intangiblities of them that make this nerd continue on being a nerd.
