         Apparently Robin and I look twenty-one because they didn't check our ID when we wandered into the Beer Garden. Whilst inside, there was this gaggle of 20-something males who happened to look quite tasty. We didn't realize until they got on stage that they were Maroon 5.   "Anna Begins" was my favorite song of the Counting Crows set. Almost everyone was singing along and it was nearly the last of their performance, so the sun was setting and people had lighters out. The lead singer, Adam, was totally high. This was mildly amusing, particularly when we lied down under the piano to sing.  There was so much marijuana in that concentrated area, it was terrific. What's better than having a foul-smelling hippie try to sell you pot?  There was also a strange Native-American man (who reminded me a lot of the one who hit on Melissa at McDonalds) who was so distracting. He sat directly behind me for the first set (and then mysteriously left) and ate pizza. Before every song he yelled, "Play some skinnard!".   John played some great new material, a lot more electric and blues-driven. He is so underrated as a guitarist. He went into a four minuet solo and did this indescribable jam. My mouth was gapping open and I think Robin took a picture of me looking that way. One song, "Come Back To Bed" was especially enjoyable, if you catch my drift. One of the best parts of the concert was when John talked to me (the audience) about random things. Before "Your Body is a Wonderland" he talked about how he was menstrual.... it was terrific.   (There's so much about that concert that I want to explain, but I can't. It's impossible.)  I stayed up until four in the morning last night, watching Empire Records and wishing that I looked like Steven Tyler's daughter. I'm not even tired this morning. I'm slipping back into my insomniatic ways.   Download "Rockin' the Suburbs" and feel my vibe.  Affectionately... Anna
