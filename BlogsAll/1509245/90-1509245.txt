         School of Rock rocked! Woo! Soooo good, really. Watch it. Love it. Feel the power of the rock.  Robin, Anna (not me, someone who's parents are also not very creative) and myself indeed felt the power of said rock. I was laughing so hard. Anna is cool because she dated this guy named Chris (who is Christian) As a result of this guy, she is also trying to stop swearing. So we mutually bonded in this bascially impossible endeavor. And plus, dude, her name is  Anna . We're like twins, minus the whole looking similar thing.  Here's something I will never understand about myself. I totally just paid twenty-one dollars for a hotel-shampoo sized bottle of Clinque. DORK!   TOMORROW IS THE PREMIERE! AHHH JOHN!!!! WOO! (Forgive the laps in composure)  I know I've been posting a lot of lyrics lately, but c'mon: this is my new favorite song....  WASTED & READY   Force field super shield AA. Junior high love affair is OK. Jump on the big wagon cause I'm so Cal. I'm big in every way. I'm running as fast as I can.  She goes above and beyond her call of duty. She is a slut but X thinks it's sexy. Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti. I am wasted but I'm ready.  If you wanna move it so, why don't you make it go. Prove to everybody who doesn't understand. All the nights, all the fights. You are out of sight. Some say more with their hand. I'm running as fast as I can.  She goes above and beyond her call of duty. She is a slut but X thinks it's sexy. Sex reminds her of eating spaghetti. I am wasted but I'm ready.  I am wasted but I'm ready. I am wasted but I'm ready. Running as fast as I can. Running as fast as I can.  Why am I dealing with this feeling? I'm maxed out like a credit card. I'll continue to be my worst enemy. It's easy but it seems so hard. You're near but you seem so far.   And so it goes... Wow, I really love my life. LIVE ON ROCK! Affectionately... Anna
