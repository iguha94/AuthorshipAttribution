         I would like to point out that although, yes, I did fail Integrated 1B, I still have a 3.4 GPA. I disgress, I am not stupid; I obviously choose to fail, right? Ok, not true. I'm so embarrassed about going to summer school that I dreampt about it last night. This morning on the way to summer school I nearly threw up. I literally had the windows rolled down and my head between my knees. I was TERRIFIED I was going to see one of my teachers. The only teachers who have ever known of my complete retardation have been math teachers. And if my, say, Global Issues teacher, saw me at summer school, his entier opinion of my would be dashed.   S.S. should be, quite frankly, fun. I'm totally not joking ethier. My teacher is Mrs. Earle, who I like. She's this tiny little woman who is always happy about something. And when I say always, I mean ALWAYS. Literally. She never gets mad. Melissa and I tried so hard to crack her in math last year. I'm not sure if any of you are framiliar with the Tampon commerical with the "Pearl, pearl, she's a pearl girl." song. We changed the lyrics to "Earle, Earle, she's an Earle girl."   Plus, Melissa, Feather, and Anne Claire are in it with me. So is "Katie Cough", who really doesn't like me. It's only because I got defensive in Science when she called me stupid. Stupid, why? Because I left my locker unlocked in PE and got all the money (change included) and clothes stolen. I guess it was my own fault, but I'm not stupid.   The cirriculum is sooooo pathetically easy that I almost feel BAD! We have 10 questions per section, and there are about 20 sections. And we have a quiz on every chapter. And whatever total grade I earn takes the place of my failing grade. So, theorically, I can get a 4 point oh. And although the course is designed to take 6 weeks, I can--again theorically-- finish (with an 'A') in three weeks. I feel bad for all the kids who tried hard and passed on their own during the actual school year.   Affectionately... Anna
