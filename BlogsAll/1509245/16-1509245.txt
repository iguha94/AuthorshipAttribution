         My infatuation with John Mayer has, as I am not the first one to admit, gotten slightly out of control. No, I am not about to start stalking him/writing his name in blood ala Angelina Joel. It's just that every time I see his music videos/pictures/hear his voice my heart starts beating abnormally and it's slightly hard to breath. But, I like it. Oh this is so so so pathetic, but I totally love him.   Before you laugh, allow me to explain...? Beyond having every desired physical attribute that I- shall we say- enjoy, it is his unbelievably perfect personality that I am in love with. HIS LYRICS! Oh sweet Jesus, his LYRICS! I hereby swear that I am not the only person to see the striking coincidences between myself and his muse, or whatever. I am trying to absolutely be totally humble and not a total nerd about it, but, like, five people have said "God, Anna. That sounds exactly like you." Hence:   -Comfortable "... gray sweatpants, no makeup.... so perfect...your mouth was so dirty" (Sweatpants are absolutely my uniform, I only curl my eyelashes and wear chapstick, and I strive for perfection in everything. Plus, I have the mouth of a sailor.)   -Your Body is a Wonderland "... your skin like porcelain.‚Äù (Since I was like, 5, the one single thing that people comment to me is my skin.)   -Tell me What to Say "... you must have heard the line about your eyes a million times..."   Theses are only some; I wish I could more effectively explain it. I really do... And think, on July Eleventh... oh...   Affectionately... Anna
