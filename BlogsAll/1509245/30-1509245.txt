         I kid you not, the preceding was a heading on an official congress webpage. I saw him on The Factor last night. Again, I kid you not, he was supporting the funding of a study of homosexuality in Indians... to the tune of two million dollars. When Mr. O'Reily said "Congressman Weiner, I just can't justify this study of gay Indians." he replied, "It's not just gay Indians, Bill, its trans-gender Indians as well."   I disagree with almost everything that comes out of the Fuckhead's mouth (ha ha, Fuckhead? Weiner?) The congressman was very defensive and whinny about every topic discussed, but can you blame him? His name is  Anthony Weiner . Imagine little Tony Weiner as a child, being taunted on the playground. That's so obviously the reason he became a politician, trying to triumph over his childhood. But it's empty victory because I seriously bet that whenever his name is announced at the Capitol, fellow congress people still snicker. And people are so busy cracking up no one probably listens to his Bills, and I bet his constituencies are all nineteen year old pothead college students who only want to wear buttons that say "Support Anthony Weiner!"   Anyway, I saw Hot Rocket Sex God today and  still don't know his name. I also learned to play chess. I'm pretty good at it, and it is very strange for me to be good at a game that requires strategy. Unfortunately, my school is trying to hard to be "Gansta" to have a Chess Club... which I would totally join just so I could say "I was in Chess Club back in the day."  Affectionately... Anna
