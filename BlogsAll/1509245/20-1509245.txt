         After the advent of digital cable in my home, I have been addicted to several channels. These include MTV2. The Independent Film Channel, Spanish MTV, and the Lifetime Movie Channel. The latter might just be my favorite. I seriously love to watch self-proclaimed "Docudramas" in which a real, true-life story is exaggerated for dramatic effect. Such as tonight's feature, "Death of a Cheerleader".   Perhaps the funniest part of 'Death of a Cheerleader' was that the film took itself seriously. We meant a sweet innocent catholic girl (Angie) who has transferred from her sweet innocent catholic school to the risky dangerous public school and meet risky dangerous peers. Angie is urged by the principal (the speech was, in fact, slow-motioned for emphasis) "....be the BEST." Angie wants to be Editor of the Yearbook because she is a good writer. (On an unrelated note, why do you have to be a good writer to be Yearbook Editor? Um, what writing is there in yearbook? Typing names?) But is turned down. So "Ang" turns to the popular crowd, who initiate her by anointing her with Mayonnaise. Eventually, Ang confesses to Stephanie that she wants to be just like her. Stephanie (TORY SPELLING) tells Ang that she's going to tell the whole school that Ang is weird. And what is a girl to do? Kill her of course!   "We're almost there and no where near it."- Oh Gilmore Girls, where would I be without you?   Affectionately.... Anna
