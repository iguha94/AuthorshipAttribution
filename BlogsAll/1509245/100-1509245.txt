         Actually, I think it was yesterday. But it was celebrated in my second and sixth period as being today. What's a girl to do? The 'G' stands for something about Geography, a deep passion of mine, so I was thrilled to receive a "I [heart] Geology!" button. The saddest thing about that statement is that I really do love Geology. Rock formations are really cool if you let them be.   But really, who coined the acronym "GIS"? Every single male person I know said "Happy GIS, Anna!" apparently it is something sexual (which I was later told by a fellow tutor) I've come to conclude that the maturity level of my fellow high schoolers is  still  overrated. It was the worst in my Photogrpahy class, where the over-hormoned boys who sit next to be freely discuss the preference of hand to masturbate with. Um, gross?   I talked to Erinn briefly today at the Library. She had G-Dogg's school picture with her. Oh. Good. Lord. Its G-tastic! He's completely turned to the side, flexing a bicep for the camera. Only he would think to do something so ironic and beautiful for something so school-sanctioned and lame. School pictures, by definition, look like crap.   The Library is really beautiful, though. It has these huge bay windows that overlook "the falls". (The falls are actually a short portion of the Spokane River forever emortalized in countless propaganda stickers.) It was snowing, and everything looks so take-my-breath-away gorgeous. I re-read some Emily Dickeson stuff. What an amazing poet. I used to read her stuff all the time. I had a picture of her on my binder for a few months in Junior High. Then one day, X@n Gilmartin (asshole, asshole, asshole!) made fun of it. So I promptly replaced it with a picture of Aaron Carter... Because he was "ohmygosh, so hot!" But really, I don't think I should be held accountable for that stupid things and people I liked at that age. I had a lot on my mind.   Affectionately... Anna
