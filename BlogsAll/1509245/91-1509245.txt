         Ah, yes. Things seem heightened and and wonderful.  Lunch was very strange indeed. I was sitting in our normal spot, being my normal giddy (retarded) self, when all of a sudden this guy strolled over. I spoke to him once last year, I believe, about the attacks on Iraq. My political beliefs have changed since then, clearly. He knows my Dad (from the Spokane league of staunch/freak/corrupt conservatives... ha ha) as well as a few other people I know. He started talking to me about the two of us being the only Republicans in the school, etc. It was indeed an awkward situation.  I don't even know this guys name.  Oh, but he knows mine.   He would not shut UP! GOOD LORD! I wanted him to leave. I really don't want to discuss the finer points of abortion while I am eating my lunch, thank you very much. And Robin, Lauren, Leigh, Annica, Adrienne, and Sally seemed to offer better conversation than critiques of our school's bias newspaper articles. Contrary to this kid's ideas, I have better things to talk about. Like John Mayer, 80s songs, and the trivialities of my day that usually occupy our conversation. And I almost had summed things up when Leigh goes, "Anna's not really a republican anymore." This comment launched an even more awkward series of reasons why ("blah blah gun control blah blah death penalty..."   At one point Robin and Adrienne started singing my favorite Flock of Seagulls song to bother me. And then Robin goes, "Hey-- remember when we were all six and didn't care about politics? That was great."   Tripp and I had a discussion on the bus. And he explained to me that he does not hate me. It bothers me that he is so critical of me. We hardly ever even talk, but at one point in time he was really a good friend. I honestly cannot handle it when people dislike me, so I guess it's good to know. But I would rather have never had that discussion in the first place.  Affectionately... Anna
