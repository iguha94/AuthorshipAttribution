         Something is wrong with Mary; and this time it is really true. I am about to disclose the stupidest thing I have ever done (keep it mind I have shoplifted and peed on people's porches...) I once read what may or may not have been Mary's diary. I was looking for paper (we were studying) when she went into the bathroom. There was this plain spiral notebook on her bed and I grabbed it. I read "I go to a school where no one accepts me for me, and I have only one true friend." I realize now how RETARDED it was to get myself into that mess. The entire page was filled with stuff, but I put it away. Still, I can never really get that out of my head.   I know a lot of the stuff I write sounds similar, but not that bad. I was able to ignore it for the time because Mary doesn't act depressed. Plus, I'm fairly convinced she means I am the true friend, not to sound cocky, but she really does hate all our other friends. And we're so close. At times, though, I think she's hiding or censoring the things she says. The last couple of weeks, I have called her house at least twice a day. She rarely calls me back and when she does she says that she's just tired, and needs a little more sleep. I know that if she were mad at me she would let me know by now. I am really concerned. It's so over-dramatic of me, but I really think something is wrong beyond just our friendship.   Anyway, I beat Anne Claire in chess! Oh yes, yes, yes: the sweet taste of victory. And I may have been hallucinating but I swear Mr. Sex God Hot Rocket Guy totally winked at me as I triumphantly announced "Oh my gawd! Check mate!"   Affectionatelyâ€¦ Anna
