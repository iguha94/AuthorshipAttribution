         It stirkes me how much I miss having a boyfriend today.  I'm jonesing for some boy-love, of the physical variety. I find myself looking at every single person of the opposite sex and pondering a possible relationship. This is such an "Anna-thing" to do. I  love love love  everyone and my friends are terrific, but there's just something about going on a date instead of having a John Hughe's marathon on a Friday night. I miss the awkwardness and the uncertainity. I miss having old people's "tisk tisk"s when we  kiss good night. I miss going half crazy trying to figure out what he's thinking. I miss having HIM smell my hair- oh how my Loreal Strawberry Smoothie Shampoo is going to waste. I miss talking on the phone about sweater lint because I've run out of subjects and I can't hang up because his voice gives me chills. In short, I'm a little desperate.  Do I have high expectations? Um, no? I'll allow you, the unbiast reader, to decide. All I ask for is a tall(ish/er) boy, my age or older, who has longish hair, a terrific sense of humor, the ability to carry on a linear conversation, someone who  doesn't  listen to faux-punk Canadian shit (or worse-- doesn't care about music) someone with values (they serriously don't have to be catholic, contrary to popular belief) and someone who LIKES ME.  I'm so scared to dive back into the Singles Scene. This sounds a little silly because I'm fifteen years old, but it's true. For now, I will oh pine for my Mr. Right Now as I listen to some 80s pop (thank you WHAM) and continue to count down the school days.... only five left.  Affectionately... Anna
