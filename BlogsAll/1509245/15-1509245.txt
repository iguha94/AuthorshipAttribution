         Oh it's those lazy crazy days of summer and I, well I have nothing to do. It's so perfectly suburban I can hardly stand it.   I'm so glad that I have this blog anonymously because I can tell no one in particular the most unAnna thing: I think I might possibly have an inkling of an interest in the band Good Charlotte. And there, hell just froze over. Who is the biggest anti faux-punk activist? Me. I still realize that they are no more punk than Eric Clapton is   Alright, they play their instruments. Am I the only one who sees the music scene as pathetic now we equate ability to play a given instrument/not lip sync to artistic suprememity? Every drummer should drum, every guitar player should play guitar, every singer should sing. And one talent should never be substituted for another. I.E. ability to belly dance and hump air cannot replace hitting the correct notes of the song, no matter how simplistic (even if it is "Baby, One More Time").   Dammit, there is just something about there evil songs! They're so catchy. Fuck me. "Girls don't like boys. Girls like cars and money." is positively restarted. And their "Anthem" is the most hypocritical thing in the history of music. "I don't ever wanna be you... don't wanna be just like you." What the fuck, Benji and Joel (yes, MTV shoved their names down my throat... not my fault!) you are just like "them". Good Charlotte represents everything I hate: commercialism, selling out, wronging the sanctity of art, and the worst sin: making me kind of like them.   So I hereby resolve to never ever like them, even if the guy with the tattoos is a little cute and even if the idea of having little old ladies instead of hot chicks in there video is kind of great and even if I never get their damn songs out of my head…   Affectionately… Anna
