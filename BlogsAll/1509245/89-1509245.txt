Justification for self-induced anti-social interaction.  Ah, the wonder that our lovely new computer. Hurrah! It is a gorgeous little friend. I am proud. I am also aware that I have become reliant on the computer over the course of the summer. I love having this blog. In my extreme dorkism, I find true joy in writing silly, cathartic posts. It suits me better to have a long e-fest of ranting rather than a number of more traditional teenage activities.   Enjoyed a nice chat with Melissa last night. She is quickly becoming my favorite person in the world. She is so supportive and so assurded about everything. It makes such a difference just to know that someone is listening to me. We're both struggling with similar "issues" I guess, and it's so nice to relate with someone. If someone would have told me last year that I would look to Melissa (of all people) for guidance there is  no way  I would have believed them. She has changed so much, so much for the better. She is still dealing with reprucutions of last year, but she is primarily happy and I am so happy  for  her.   The day was rather dismal. My cold seems to be mutating into a Super Cold with inhuman abilities... such as creating copious amount of snot and erratic bout of the chills. Ick. Alas, I am still lost with my English vocabulary (which I find terribly trivial)   Affectionately... Anna
