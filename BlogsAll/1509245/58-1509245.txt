          Reason #312 to hate Spokane : Cold/flu season starts in September and lasts until June. It seems that I have caught the latest virus. It is only a matter of time before I go to my pediatrician, and our conversations go something like this:   Dr. Morgan : You have pneumonia. Me: Really? Um, don't you need to listen to my lungs or something...?  Dr. Morgan : [Listens to my chest] Cough, please. [Disgusting hacking ensues]  Dr. Morgan : You have pneumonia.  That's right, people, because when I get sick I get sick all the way. No half-assed colds for this girl; I get viral infections.   So, aside from my cold there is little going on. I am tired, but what else is new. My director from  The Laramie Project  and  And Then They Came For Me...  asked me if I was trying out for the fall play,  Little Women . I probably will, too. I want to be the one who dies. I've always wanted to do a dramatic death scene.   The Russian girl I am tutoring (Yanna) cheated on her Vocabulary test today. She wrote the answers on a little piece of paper and cupped it in her hand. It was awful. It's frustrating because she is so good at reading, but she doesn't understand a word of it. And when I saw that piece of paper, which she had to have made in apprehension of this test, I wanted to cry. If I think it's frustrating trying to tutor her, imagine what it is like for her! Here she is in an entirely foreign country, and everything is totally unfamiliar to her. For all I know, she was the Brainiac of her school in Russia, and here she needs a tutor. It seems so unfair.  Team Death lives! We, again, lost every game in Zero Hr. today. Our motto, "Look alive, team Death!" Affectionately... Anna
