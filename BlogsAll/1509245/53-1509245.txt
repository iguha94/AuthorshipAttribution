         "This has just been one of those days." Math Teacher  "This whole week has been one of those days."   "Anna, you mean that this week has been what one of those weeks." Girl in math class  "Ughhhh, shut up."   I have decided, or it was decided for me, that I am way too sensitive. I think Robin meant it as a joke, but it wasn't all that funny because it is true. It was declared after a particularly sticky situation with Meghan.  Meghan is my stronghold, the one person I have been able to consistently count on through my life. She has always been there, and we have so much history together. Awesome as she is, ever since we became friends at eight year olds, she has consistently made me feel bad about myself. Just in day-to-day conversations, I tend to feel awkward and mean. Talking about something like shoe, Meg passive-aggressively makes me feel awful. Very belittled.  I guess I had never thought of that before. I mean, I definitely felt bad before but it's it's bit of a revelation that maybe some of the blame is Meg's. Wow.  Totally  a revelation. This may take a while to fully digest. And strange...   Anyway, we had a passive-aggressive awful disagreement about curling irons. Why is it that whenever I decide to stick up for myself that I always end up worse than if I had just taken it? And man, must I again mention: it was an argument about CURLING IRONS?   I think I have serious potential as a professional whiner.... Anna
