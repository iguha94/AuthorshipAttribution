         What can I say? The sound isn't working on my computer and I have no lyrics to be inspired by.   Laurle, a very tall girl in my AP History class, recognized the Police lyrics on my bookcover today. It was wonderful. Turns out she has a very good sense of music. A very well-rounded sense, too. We annoyed Adrienne to death while talking about the finer point of Coletrane.   I also came to realize I am developing a really unhealthy crush on this friend of Robin's. And it is really wrong. It is driving me nuts. No one must ever know of this atrocity. I am so glad my friends don't know about this blog. And if they ever find it, I will delete this entry. Because this crush is bad. And stupid. And it will pass in a week.  Speaking of the opposite sex. I had to ride the bus home today. And we now have to sit three to a seat. And it sucks. So I was sandwiched between two boys rather ungracefully. And one turns to me and says, "Anna. Do you know Mr.----------" (unnamed quasi-affair-having teacher) This was strange because a) I had no idea who this guy was and b) I think I would remember some one of his, umm, nature. (In a good way) So our conversation went like this: "Umm, yah!" "Well he was playing Jimmy Fallon today."  WHAT! HOW DID HE NOW ABOUT MY MINOR JIMMY FALLON OBSESSION!  "Seriously?" "Yes. The basketball song." "Oh yah, that's a good one." "This is my stop." "Umm, bye."  Weird, weird, weird.  Affectionately... Anna
