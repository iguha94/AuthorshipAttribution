         For any one who is remotely close to me, they know that I have a huge problem with sleep. On average, I get about 5 hours. It's not rare that I get less than 3. During my more insomniac eposoids (15 minuets of sleep at a time, one hour a night) I have insane dreams. My dreams are pretty funny after the fact, like my mares of fighting for the British in the Reveloutionary War, and hiding in my hope chest from my friends. Lately, I keep having the same crazy dream over and over.   I'm sitting on my bed and my mom screams for me "Phoooooone!" and I answer and it's Justin Timberlake. I hate Justin Timberlake, in real life and in my dream. Justin says to me "Do you know who this is?" and I tell him "Yes, duh." Then I get the distinct feeling that I hurt his feelings. And that is the end of my dream.   I sent this dream to this terrific website and here's the analysis I got back:   Hello Anna,   Your dream is a warning about some trouble that is about to surface, the phone call was to tell you that you have a rival where you least expect it. Justin was trying to bring your attention to the problem arising represented by what he said, Do you know who it is. In the dream you replied yes, therefore this person is already in your circle and known to you. When you thought you had hurt his feelings it was also a warning that you will be hurt by this person who is pretending to be something they are not. Because you where sitting on your own bed this is reminding you that you have a secure foundation around you and you will overcome any difficult situations.   Angel blessings  Invisible Friends
