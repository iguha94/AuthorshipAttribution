         Tomorrow is my last day of school! And besides my English and Global Issues finals, I have two other (if conflicting) events. One is Drum Circle (see the 6th), and one is Melissa's water fight. She's having a huge end-of-the-year water fight/party in the park. It's going to be a lot of fun, if I go. Drum Circle--- well, I have no idea what to expect, if I go. I was kindov amped up and excited for it, except for what happened today at lunch.   My lunch crew; Robin, Leigh, Mary, and Lauren decided to take a break from the norm and eat outside. It was a really nice day, and we were having some really in-depth conversation about our hair, so it was good times. But as we walked past Feather and Katie V. , Feather goes "Annnnnnnna! I love your outfit." I'm halfway positive that she was being sarcastic because I was wearing sweatpants, All Stars, and a t-shirt Sam gave me that says "I Love NERDS". (Katie apparently thought that it was revolutionary to say 'I love nerds too!' ---which it was not, because about a thousand random people said that today) Then she goes "Annnnna, Ali is going to DRUM CIRCLE tomorrow, with us, and she doesn't hate you." This was followed by several inaudible sentences. Needless to say, she and her crew were ether a) totally high or b) totally smashed. They looked and sounded absolutely stupid, like total alcoholics/potheads. And I realize that I don't want to be like that. At all. Dammit, catholic upbringing!  Tomorrow will be interesting, I assure you. Affectionately...Anna
