         Plans for tonight: 10 PM showing of Office Space with Robin, Jamie, and Anna (not me, other Anna). Sounds like it will indeed be a joyous affair complete with me screaming out the dialogue in certain scenes ("WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FLAIR!") I will overdose on sugar, as is ritual, then come home, catch a re-run of Degrassi, and promptly fall sleep in my jeans.  Today was fine, thank you. As is usual, nothing happened really. I was actually  called on  in History, which managed to keep me awake, despite a tempting desire to fall asleep (...damn Pelopenisans!) The Junior from last Friday approached us again during lunch. I tried very hard to avoid eye contact and busy myself with the eating of carrots and fiddling with my backpack. No luck. At least he didn't actually sit down, though. He said something about me not smiling enough, to which I replied, "Heh" unenthusiastically. Poor kid, he needs a life. My advice to him is stop wasting time courting me and find someone more worthwhile. Perhaps someone more interested. Together they could have mad, passionate Republican love. I can picture it; him romancing her with Rush Limbaugh quotes and exerts from  The Conscience of a Conservative .   Dad bought a new scanner. It is a gorgeous piece of machinery. You can now view pictures of me and my silly little life   here  Meanwhile, I am off to enjoy my little life... pretty much anyway.  Affectionately... Anna
