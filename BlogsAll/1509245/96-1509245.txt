         A word to the wise; after another massive snowfall do not walk a) to the car b) to your classes or c) anywhere else.   Last night I had the brilliant idea to write down all the things that keep me from falling asleep, maintaining sleep, and thus being an overall normal, well-adjusted and sleep-satisfied teenager.   11:06- Listen to 'Wheel', sigh wholeheartedly. Drift off while thinking about New York, a happier life, oh--and John.  11:39- Awake from a distinct itch on my left earlobe.  11:42- Open blinds by bed. Sit on floor in front of window. Stare at snow.  11:42:30- Cat joins me.  12: 09- Go downstairs and admire snow from living room couch. Drift to sleep poetically.  1:12- Wake up. Think about the book I was reading earlier. Consider running away from home. Fall asleep again.  2:00- Move to TV room.  2:15- Move back to living room. Turn up heat to seventy-two degrees. Write a stupid poem.  3:00- Ok. No fooling now. Time for sleep. Go to room, chew comforter violently. Realize chewing on my comforter tastes like the time I chewed on an aspirin.  3:02- Brush teeth.  3:03- I am going to be sorry tomorrow. I fall asleep.  3: 23- Wake up for no reason whatsoever. Listen to 'Wheel' with the volume level on 2. Fall asleep.  4:17- Wake up to the sound of my cat clawing the door. She wants out. I let her out. I then can't fall back to sleep. Look out window. A fucking raccoon runs across the street.  I live in hickville ! I hate Spokane!  4:20- Sleep.  5:30- Alarm clock welcomes me to the world of the wake. Eww.   Tomorrow my oldest brother comes home. Oh, I shall undoubtedly have a future report on his latest lecture. Be it on the harmful effects of pot, alcohol, or giving in to other people's standards. it is sure to make me want to strangle him. He is insaneng isane,   here is his website  to prove it. But I love him. Both being burdened with a disgusting gene that makes us translucently pale, we can at least relate on that level.   Affectionately... Anna
