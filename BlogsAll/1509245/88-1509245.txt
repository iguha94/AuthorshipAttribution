         Since school has started I have  lost ten freaking pounds . Absolutely and definetly "freaked" up. There is absolutly no rhyme or reason for this. I have been getting my protein and taking my vitamins. Being Vegan tends to make you healthier, a little stealth, but healthy. It is just not natural to loose ten pounds in a month, especally when the only significant change is school starting. Grr.. anger.  Ah, as you may have guessed by the post time, I am home sick. I went to my zero hour class and nearly drowned in a my own personal sea of snot. So a decision was made to return to my bed. Where I sit and read magazines and attempt to finish  Catcher in the Rye . I bought that book three weeks ago and I have yet to read past chapter five.  Joe has yet to turn in his Senior picture and quote. Ah, procrastination runs deep in our family genes. His favorite movie is Half Baked, which is terribly funny in the easy-humor pot-is-funny kind of way. I'll spare the reasoning, but suffice it to say that Abba Zabba candy bars are funny. And he wanted me to take a picture of him with one sticking out of his pocket for his sr. picture. We then cruised on over the Fred Meyers for One Hour Photo, which we then realized actually lasts an hour. We passed the hour by driving way too fast up and down hills. At one point we went to the park, where he was going to show me this little cleared out area where he and his friends hang out. Here is a reenactment of what happened:  Joe: ... yeah, I think "G-Dogg" hangs out here. Me [In loud pitched squeal]: Oh my god, I love "G-Dogg"!! [Joes turns around] Me: Why are we leaving? Joe: "G-Dogg" is hanging out here.  Hopelessly daydreaming about my future life, one devoid of Spokane and rich with content.  Affectionately... Anna (or what's left of me anyway...)
