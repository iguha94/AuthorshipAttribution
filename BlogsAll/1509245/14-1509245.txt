         Thanks to Katie for "letting" me steal this idea from   her blog .   -Is it wrong that I watched 'American Juniors' and voted for Grace? Because it seems like there is something inherently wrong with supporting that evil of that show. Which may, perhaps, be it's appeal. I've encountered many a stage mother in my day--believe me. But none who have actually exploted their children all the way to the Reality-Contest Show scene.  -Is it wrong that I have worn the same tank top and boxers for nearly 48 hours?  -Is it wrong that I have been listening to the same Stevie Ray Vaugn riff continuously for two hours? (How the hell one man is capable of that talent is beyond me)  -Is it wrong that I have begun updateing this blog twice a day?  -Is it wrong that I want to be a hermit? That's not really fair. Okay, a quasi-hermit. Is that wrong? Quasi-hermitum?  -Is it wrong that I think that Pete Yorn and Jason Mraz are ubber lame? Clearly I don't think so, but why don't you weigh in. As far as I'm concerned, they're obvious John Mayer-envy is a little disgusting. You'd think they'd have a little more dignity. Although he's adorable, Jason Mraz not only has the same initals and number of syabells in his name (I guess that's debateable, he may not be able to help it) but also his performance in the "The Remedy" video uses the same lighting as John's performance in the "No Such Thing" video. And Pete Yorn has similar hair. IS THERE NO END?!?!?  -Is it wrong that I want to learn to play the key-tair?  -Is it wrong that I think everything tastes better with mustard? Even applesause?   A. ... A.
