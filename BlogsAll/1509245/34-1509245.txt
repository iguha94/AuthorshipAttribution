         Mary is really mad at me this time. Usually we talk on the phone twice a day and venture out of Hermitum every other day, but I haven't spoken to her since "the incident" (see last Thursday) I've called her and left benign messages ("Hey Maweee! It's Anna, call me.") and yet she hasn't called back. Normally, when we get mad at each other, we still hang out and talk. After a while of grudge-holding we eventually give up "Fuck! Ok; I'm sorry." The longest I've gone without talking to her was when I went to the Capitol to be a Senate Page back in January, and that was only a week.   "Does it surpirse you to know that the total number of three identical pyramids equals the volume of one prism with the same base and area height?"-  Integrated 1 Mathmatics, Chapter 9.7  I am so frustrated, I still have a chapter and a half of homework to do before I can finish summer school, not to mention all of the quizzes I have to take... and the final. I wanted to be done by this Friday, but I know remember that this Friday is The Concert. And there is no way in hell I would ever miss that concert... literally. I would walk to George (the town) if I had to. This is quite a statement because George is like, 300 miles away.  I'm considering an all night homework session so that tommorw all I have to do is take my quizes. Oh shit, I just remembered I also have to take the Chapter tests. Fuck. I'm so screwed. I now  have to  have an all night homework session, and this won't even get me ahead. Ahh, the life of a fifteen year old procrastinator with ADD.   Affectionately... Anna
