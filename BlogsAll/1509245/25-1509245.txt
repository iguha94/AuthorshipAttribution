         On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives. They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes. (All your life) All your life all you've asked when's your Daddy gonna talk to You. You were living in another world tryin' to get your message through. No one heard a single word you said. They should have seen it in your eyes What was going around your heart.  In an effort to stop my pathetic Jr. High tendencies, I am not going to mention that there are (awesomely yummy) pictures of John Mayer is the new issue of Rolling Stone. I am not going to mention, ether, that Heavier Things will be released in two months. And I am definitely not going to mention that he was nominated for a VMA... no way. I'm simply growing to mature, people. Deal with it.  I am, however, going to tell you about the massive panic attack I had today. Mr. Goheler called to notify my mom that I several things missing from my (cough) summer school (cough) curriculum. It was awful. The Units are so disappointed in me. I am so disappointed in me. I was feeling genuinely bad until Sam reminded me that Mr. Goehler is "like, totally gay". Then I played air guitar and lip synced to Bon Jovi (old school, of course) in my room until I felt sufficiently better. I reasoned that I was just too much of a Little Runaway to conform to the measures of Freshman math. Unfortunately, we live too far from Jersey for the Units to understand this logic, and I have until Thursday to re-take the final.   I almost forgot! The Garland midnight movie this Saturday... THE GOONIES! I am syced, sincerely you guys. I'm all ready to do the Truffle Shuffle and crave "Roc-key Ro-oAD?". Of all of those medley kids, I've always been quite fond of Data, the Boy Wonder who can save lives with a pair of dentures. But that's not to say I don't appreciate the legend that is Sloth. "Hee-ey you guys!"  My blog is becoming ridiculously ridiculous. Sorry.   Affectionately... Anna
