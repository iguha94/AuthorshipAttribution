Good is when your friends call you before class to check in, when they relay a message to your mother that they will think about you in your absence. Good is bonding with a can of your favorite soda and falling into the boy-with-guitar dream that your DVD so aptly displays. Good is when your friends rally around a cellphone during lunch to communicate to you, in your Bad state, that they love you. Good is when you paramountly realize that they care.
