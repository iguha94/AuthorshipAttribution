         Last night was the night; the event. As Mary would say, "Whoop-de-flippin'-doo!" The point is, I had an awesome time.   I was scheduled to baby-sit for my dad's partner's children prior to the event. The Units went to see Seabiscuit, and I got a very good recommendation for it after they came home. That is to say, they're coming home was an event. They arrived (slightly tipsy) at 10:45, which left me fifteen minuets to get ready to hit the town/ get they smell of Apple Chicken baby food out of my hair. This was not easily done. I got to Robin's late. But it was worth it because not only we were in time, but there was a hubbub about THE HAIR. My new throwback to emo punk is a huge hit. Robin said, "Oh my god, now I have a friend who looks like a model. Dammit. I look worse by comparison. This sucks. Not that your former haircut didn't evoke model-esque qualities. I LOVE YOU!"  The movie was great, partially due to the extreme amount of sugar we beforehand consumed. I had licorice and taffy, not to mention a 72 ounce Diet Pepsi. We were clapping and cheering through the cast list... yah Corey Feldman! Sean Astin and John Pantoliano got cheers as well. I love the audience at the Midnight movies... everyone is my kind of people. Very hip and edgy, not a spec of Ambercrombie in site. I'm pretty sure everyone there had seen The Goonies already, because people were reciting dialogue throughout he show. I forgot how much I seriously love that movie... Data is so my favorite. I love his "Power Pinchers". My favorite quote, after he is rescued and his dad breaks the camera, "That's ok, Dad, you can't hug a photograph." Awww...  Tomorrow I venture into the Idaho wilderness for five lovely days, and thus I will be taking a break from blogging. I'm going to be at church camp-- but I will be keeping a meticulous account of the memorable things that happen. Ciaro. Affectionately... Anna
