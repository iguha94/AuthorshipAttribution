         When I was getting back from the gym this morning, a completely unexpected occurrence knocked me off-kilter.  Yes, I vowed to minimalize the amount of Jr. High shit in this blog. However, this is important and it doesnâ€™t directly pertain to Cataldo. By some strange phenomena I haven't seen/spoken to anyone who went on to catholic high school. (This is everyone but me and Meg, as well as the Unnamed Evil Whore and Sean C.) You would think that I would have run into somebody---anybody--- in the course of a year. I've, of course, analyzed this situation, to no avail. I have no explanation; I like to think of it as Divine Intervention (thanks, Christ!) I had nearly stopped thinking about it until... dun dun dun-- it happened. I saw Suzanne and her sister downtown. I was quietly freaking out and trying to avoid them, when she Suze saw me. There was a terrifying moment when she looked like she was going to come and say hi, but luckily I scampered away.  My reaction is, obviously, retarded and immature. In my perfect world I would have strode over to her and said, "Oh my goodness! Suze!". To be honest, Suzanne was really cool at CCS. It was her, Amanda, Danielle, Patsy and (eventually) Morgan who I most came-to-terms with. That is to say, I don't hate them. In the same aspect, I don't really care anymore: a major determination.   Does it bother anyone that I've become the single most Analytical/Immature fifteen year old on the face of the planet?  I read on article on Ryan Pinkster (I think that's it) ala Punk't fame in USA Today today. He's apparently four foot eight and one hundred pounds. I had no idea why that statistic was important, nah---relevant--- until I read that he is fifteen years old. Good lord! That's not tall. Being an Ogre myself (5'7.5") I haven't been four-eight since I was four.  Affectionately... Anna
