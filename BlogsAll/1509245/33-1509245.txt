         Words cannot even describe, good lord- words cannot even describe...   Prior to July 11, 2003 there had been three incredible moments in my life that I knew I would always remember. One was my first kiss. It took place backstage on closing night of A Mid Summer Night's Dream. Another was when Maryellen, Claire, and I tamponed and toilet-papered her neighborhood, along with all sorts of semi-illegal activities which bonded us as closer friends than I had ever known; I remember clearly and distinctly thinking that I never felt so alive. The third was opening night of The Wiz of the West, when I had my first leading role ever. Looking out at the audience, I knew I was born to be an actress--- no matter what.  The John Mayer/Counting Crows concert beat all of them.  I wish I could describe exactly what it feels like to want something so bad and to have it realized. For an ungodly number of hours I've considered what it would be to be in the presence of John. Every feeling of adoration was solidified with the first note of the first song. I simply fell into his words and into the music. I was completely unaware that anything else existed. He delivered me precious assurance within a span of an hour, singing the same songs he's preformed hundreds of times before. Then, during "3x5" he looked into the audience and for a single, shinning second--looked directly at me. Just out of nowhere.  Do I even need words? Affectionately... Anna
