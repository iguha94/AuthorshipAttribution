         I realize that I didn't leave a farwell or at least, an explanation, before my vacation. So on this gorgeous day in Miami I am sitting in an Internet Cafe counting down hours until my happy return home. I've just disembarked form  Paradise  (our ship) and feel it necessary to relay some of the important things I learned thorughout the last seven days.  1. Being a Vegan and going on a cruise is like an anorexic walking into Cinnabun. 2. As the ship is a top of water, and subseqently upon waves, it (gasp!) moves. This strange cruise-ship-movement will make you sick. Period. 3. People in the Virgin Islands smoke lots and lots of marijuna. And they have no qualms about admitting it. 4. When you tell people you're from Spokane, Washington they will always ask where it is in relation to Seattle. Always. 5. Apperently, East Coasters refer to Oregon as "Or-eee-goooone".  I had a lot of fun, nice weather, nice people. I have to say that the Cruise Director was one of the highlights of the trip. His name, and it says this on his nametag, was "Karl with a K". He had the best accent I have ever heard. He literally said things like "Pip pip", "Cheerio", and "Bob's your uncle". Previously, I thought that saying those things was reserved for Jimmy Stewert ala Mary Poppins.   Don't worry... plenty for highjinxs to tell you about later. Possibly pictures. Kate--- hang in there with the whole Back-To-School Tramatic Stress Syndrome.  I'm  back in two weeks. Christ!  Affectionately... Anna
