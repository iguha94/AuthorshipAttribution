         Much thanks, Isral.   Christmas shopping today. I have ordered my father's presents and today bought Joey's. We browsed through Barnes and Noble. Here's another difference between him and I. As he leafed through Mexican Travle books:  Dad: "Sigh... I wish I were in Cabo right now picking the sand out of my toes."  Me: "I wish I were in New York right now, wiping the bum pee off my shoes."   I pined for the Coltrane box set for some time. Josh Groban has a new CD out, and I wanted to cry when I saw it. Last Christmas, I bought Mary his last CD. She was in love with Josh and his curly locks, like I love John Mayer and his brooding eyes. Its really pathetic that I can't let that whole thing go.   I eventually found my way to a hippie store, a beautiful place where I buy a lot of cards and posters. Everything is very peace-not-war (plus tax) and there is usually a lot of strong incense burning. I noticed the dreadlock-sporting guy behind the cash register was averting eyes with his boss the same way my brother does when he comes home from "just hanging out" (POT) I bought a 'Free Tibet' card and an very profound bumper sticker.   Does anyone remember when Hot Topic was hardcore? Sometime over the summer they started selling out-- opps, I mean selling Good Charlotte t-shirts. Same thing.   Affectionately... Anna
