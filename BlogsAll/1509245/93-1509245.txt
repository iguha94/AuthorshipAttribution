         First, everyone check out   Kate's post  for today. This is the stuff I aspire to write.  KWNIDK (Bryce) does not like Good Charlotte. In fact, he hates them. Surprise, surprise: I was wrong. Either way, it's good news to know.  By the grace of God, I have an A in math. Wha...?  I know. I am amazed. Actually I have an A in every class. See, people! Who says physiological obsessions (re: my OCD) are all bad?   Got lazy at lunch and felt a need to hang with my pals then got to ROCK. We had a conversation about inseams. Lauren, Robin and I are all very tall (5'7", 5'9", 6'0") None of us can find correctly-fitting pants. They are all too short.  Supposed schedule for this weekend: Friday School of Rock at RiverPark Square, SNL premiere on Saturday at Robin's (Jack Black/ John Mayer) and of course, church on Sunday. Adrienne wants to go to breakfast at the Club beforehand. They serve the best oatmeal in town, apparently.   If I decide to try out for Little Women I need to do it quickly. I have to have a monologue by the sixth. Callbacks are the seventh. I just hope that I have enough time in my schedule to do it. With the amount of homework, it seems unlikely. Ugh. Speaking of my theatric escapades, I have been informed that there is a picture of me ala  ...And Then They Came For Me  floating around our school site. It is the one from the yearbook, where you can see everyone but me. Sort of. It was suppose to be an artsy/dramatic photo, but it ended up looking silly because we were all laughing. (I am the in the last row, second one. The one smiling, although I am suppose to be depicting a holocaust victim.)   Nice, right?   Affectionately... Anna
