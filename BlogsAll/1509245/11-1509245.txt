         In Kelly Clarkson's "Miss. Independent", she says "What happened to Miss. Indepen-DENT?" Not, as previously thought, "What happens to my cinnamon NUTS?"   At the risk of sounding nerdy (oh wait, I guess I'm already a nerd: I have a website) the next Harry Potter book is released in t-minus four hours, forty three minuets. My excitement is thanks to Andria Nanni introducing me to the series in 6th grade (thanks a heap for making me a full fledged nerd, Andi!) But an underlying reason for my interest is JK Rowling. For those of you who are HP-inept (that would be anyone cool) each novel chronicles one year in the life of Harry Potter. I think he'll be sixteen (or fifteen? I'm not sure) in this one. Prior to this edition, JK Rowling has avoided most teenage boy things (i.e. the other magical instrument Harry poses, and the "spells" he can "cast" with it). Since I think that she is a good writer, she will have to bring up SOMETHING about it.   Let me also express my feelings toward our neighbors to the north, "Ohhhhh Canada..." (that's sung to the Canadian National Anthem, by the by). My dear readers, did you know that they have put gay marriage, the legalization of marijuana and HERION on the ballot? Now, the homosexual-marriage thing I'm okay with. I don't really care, since it doesnâ€™t affect Americans at all. A Canadian marriage of a girl and a girl or the Canadian marriage of a boy and a boy isn't LEGALLY recognized in this country. And narcotics-trafficking from Canada won't be tolerated. But the chronic? There's not really much of a way to control that. We already have enough Chic and Chong wannabes here. Canada is three hours away! Good lord.   Affectionately... Anna
