         I promised that after my bout of strange self-confidence, that my head would shrink down to human size. I would like to personally thank Anne-Claire for this. She sure knows how to make a girl feel bad about herself, thanks! The following things are those which Anne Claire pointed out to me. I like to call it... Things That Are Wrong With Anna: -I am stupid for breaking up with Behren.   Even though he compromised my morals and tried to take advantage of how much I "loved" (please note the quotations) him.  -I have split ends. -I am desperate. -I suck at math. -I am "a little snobby" but I "can't help it, and it's totally not as bad as Elissa". -I talk too loud. -( ...after lowering my voice )...still talk too loud.  She said it within the course of a normal conversation, adding the insults between "my boyfriend is so hot" and "I am so musically talented". I could tell that she was waiting for me to flip out, but I couldn't give her the satisfaction. I didn't know how to respond, I couldn't say anything. I didn't want to let her add "unable to control her emotions." and "mean." to the list.   We were at The Rocket when it all happened. Thank godness Sex God wasn't working. It would have been doubly bad if he had been there. The girl working the cappuccino machine heard every word, though. I want to hate Anne-Claire so much. The assault was totally unprovoked, and I was  buying her lunch  at the time. I hate myself even more, because after she was done with lunch, I bought her an extra bagel, with the expensive cream cheese. It wasn't so much to be nice, but she asked if I would buy her one. And I obediently did so, like a fucking idiot. Oh well, I hope she gets fat.   Which puts me in this position; sitting and listening to Counting Crows "Colorblind" whilst sulking. Affectionately... Anna
