         This first thing I did this morning, right after I woke up: I played air guitar to 'Tiny Dancer'. And why is this weird, you ask? Because Elton John plays the  piano .  I then ate a bowl of instant oatmeal, read the 'In Life' section of the  Spokesman Review , and roamed around the house looking for something to appease my boredom. Somehow, I've lost all interest in TV. I washed my hands (woo! OCD!) for a good five minuets trying to decide on something to do. I still have yet to find anything worth me showering for.  Somehow I found my way to the   Spokane visitor page . It is the most absurd collection of out-right lies ever formulated. "The Spokane area is also known as the cultural hub of the Inland Northwest." What the fuck?!? No, it is  not . We have a total of five Africanan-Americans, and like, six Hispanic people. "The Spokane Arena is the site of world-class concerts..." If by 'world-class' you mean Nsync coming here in '99, then sure-- we're world-class alright. If anyone here wants to see a decent concert they have to sit in a car for three hours and drive to the Gorge.   Let's keep this crazy-train rolling! "...There are so many fun things to do in and around the Spokane region. Scream down the world's largest wooden roller coaster..." That roller-coaster is in  Idaho . That's an hour drive from Spokane, people, in Athowl, Idaho. And my favorite lie, "...you'll find that Spokane has an abundance of attractions, activities and amenities to offer..." No, dammit, it doesn't. The very fact that I sit here bored to death is due to lack of the aforementioned.  Affectionately... Anna  Oh, and I'm getting my review on.
