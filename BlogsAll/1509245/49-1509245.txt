         I saw Bend It Like Beckham today.  I swear to god that the guy in the train station from Harry Potter was the dad. No joke.   Apparently my haircut is still a big deal. Leigh was going on about how I look so much (get ready)  older - which completely defeats the purpose. That might explain why a guy (who was, honestly, quite hot) hit on me downtown today. He was at least twenty-five.   I really like The Cardigans right now. And The Tragically Hip. And Hot Hot Heat (even though they're totally mainstream). I'm still sticking with old favorites, of course. What would a summer day be without a little Ben Folds 5 and some show tunes? At least one round of 'Dance: Ten, Looks: Three' has to make it into the mix.  School is starting so fucking soon. I've got to admit, I'm excited. I'll have an entirely different set of classes, set of teachers. I won't be a freshman anymore. I'll pretty much know my way around. I have G-Dogg to look forward to... I pray I have at least one class with him. I will be free of the bus! I'll know so many more people than I did at the start of last year. And I'll have an outlet for my OCD-- SCHOOLWORK! Isn't it sad that I'm looking forward to writing papers that exceed the limit of words? Re-copying my math problems even though I know the answers are still half-assed and wrong? Sticking my head so far up my teachersâ€™ asses that I won't see daylight until next summer? Yes, yes it is. I realize that. But it doesn't change the fact that I am totally looking forward to doing all those things.  Affectionately... Anna
