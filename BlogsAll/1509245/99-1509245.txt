         Card Robin made me today:   Dearest Anna, I love you so much sometimes I wish I was cool like you. I m grateful that we have become tha great friends and that we have gotten to talk about how fucked up/ slash not really our lives are/slash were! Anna, I [heart] you! You make my day great everyday. I hope you know how cool and beautiful and specail you are in my life. You Are so incredibly awsome and I don't know how to spell!  Robin/slash just kidding    The card was my "payback" for the card I gave her in September. She had just done a schedule overhaul and was stressed out to an unRobin degree. The "/slash" thing is something we say all the time now. It’s a very convenient way to shorthand a conversation. I suggest it.   I bought a new journal is October with Adrienne and now its nearly full. There are only a few pages left in it. So much heat went into it. I wanted to explain every bad feeling away when I first bought it. The first few entries are really sad, bittersweet ones. After I read The Perks of Being a Wallflower, everything was introspective and bleak for a few weeks.   Ever since I was a small, small child I have these out-of-body moments. I feel like I’m suddenly looking at my life on a higher plane. By definition, such a feeling is hard to explain. I told a friend about it once at Cataldo. Usually it’s right before I fall asleep or right before I get out of bed. I feel like I’m somewhere between now and never. How I feel like maybe there is no one else alive at that very second, and that for some reason I am really special and different for that moment. I don’t think she really understood what I meant, “Um, maybe that’s what drugs are like or something.”   Affectionately… Anna
