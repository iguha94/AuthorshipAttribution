         I just finished watching a great foreign flick, "RINGU". It's the original (Japanese) version of "The Ring". For those of you who haven't seen the ring, here's the basic plot: scare the shit out of Anna. I watched it in theaters with my best friend, Meghan, who is as uber sensitive as I am. We were literally crying and screaming and covering our faces. I'm fairly positive that this ruined the movie for everyone else within a 10 seat range. I kicked the guy's seat in front of me so much that he literally got up and moved! I also confess that I slept in my parent's room that night. It was a really good movie though, despite my abnormal reaction. RINGU however, was made in '97. I had to watch it with subtitles, but it was pretty good. If anything, it gave me a greater appreciation of the magic of Hollywood... Americans can seriously spice up a movie.   I'm sure you're all pondering how I spent my Friday night (or maybe your not, either way I'm going to tell you.) I want with Mary to a Christian-rock concert. To be perfectly honest, I was a little bit uncomfortable. I'm indivualistic when it comes to prayer and to worship, so I felt strange doing it with so many people. I like Christian music, too. Sure I don't really ever listen to it, but I like it. I can't fault people for praising God, so I won't. I will, however, regale you with perhaps the most hilarious displays of I-don't-know-what ever to be witnessed. After a rousing  sing  along to the Pledge of Allegiance, the arena went pitch black. After a few dramatic minuets of this, the singer was spotlighted with a huge American flag, which he began waving over the crowd and announcing "WE LIVE IN GOD'S COUNTRY!" "THERE'S NO OSAMA BIN LADEN HERE!" "GOD BLESSES AMERICA LIKE NO OTHER!". Hey- I love America too- but this display of patriotism was a bit over the top. I was trying sooooo hard not to laugh, people, but I couldn't help myself....   Affectionately... Anna
