         I wish we didn't live in a world where people like Good Charlotte and Beyonce existed. I really do.  The MTV VMAs were last night. And I watched. To be more adequate, I watched the VMA  Extravaganza!!! . Said  Extravaganza!!!  began with the Red Carpet Pre Show and ended only after the adorably sexy Gideon Yago bided me adieu via the Post Show. Highlights of the show include: Beyonce being hung by her ankles, a lifetime achievement award being given to Duran Duran, Jimmy Fallon and the Fab Five, and the Good Charlotte performance. God, I love those punk kids.... ha ha ha. Just kidding. I became physically ill during the Good Charlotte performance (and again:  they are not punk !)After they finished performing the Single Most Hypocritical Song in the Universe, they attempted to be punk by kicking over the sounds amps. My dad said "Ohhh, watch out! Make sure the equipment doesn't fall on your dancers!" Was he making a joke? No, they had fucking dancers. Will the hypocrisy never end?   It's been a while since I have posted a new featurette, so here we go. I've been writing a journal on and off since I was five, and a lot of weird things/thought/crap has bloomed from journaling. And wouldn't you know it; some of them are actually pretty amusing. And so, here is today's RANDOM EXERT FROM AN OLD JOURNAL THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE MILDLY AMMUSING:  December 12, 2002 My thoughts run through my head faster than I can think them. Figure that one out .  Affectionately... Anna
