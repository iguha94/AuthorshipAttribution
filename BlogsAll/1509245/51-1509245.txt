         Yesterday I got a really great pin from Value Village that from pre- child molester Michael Jackson. It has a faux-signature, which offsets the mustard-yellow suit he's wearing. I think it's either Thriller or barely pre-Thriller. I love it to death. I'm going to put it on my messenger bag next year.   I also dropped a ridiculously high amount of money at Nordstrom. Among the things I got: the pink cargo capris (they sounds tacky, but I swear they aren't) and this low cut wrap-around sweater. The sweater is unbelievably soft and slightly risqué. I can't wait until it gets cold again so I can actually wear it. I love sweaters and ear muffs much more than I like sandals and halter tops. Despite the great clothes, I really hate shopping at Nordstrom. I want to buy almost everything I see, and I usually end up getting pretty damn close. I feel materialistic and vain. At least it's not Abercrombie. I would rather wipe Saddam Hussein's ass than shop there. I vehemently oppose any and all items purchased there. It's this whole lame sub-culture thing at school. No joke, Heather has referred to tons of guys as looking "so Abercrombie!” To me the very word evokes nauseam.   This is all, of course, in preparation for the impending school year. Ugh. I am so far from looking forward to it. I mean, I miss school work, but not actual school. I miss lunch on the Third Floor, of course, and I miss seeing G-Dogg on a regular basis. However; I do not miss Pedophilic teachers, the permanent smell of pot in the bathrooms, my locker being vandalized, or being three floors from my next class while the minuet bell is ringing. I'm really not looking forward to next year. But unless I get some Divine Intervention, it looks as if I'm destined to go. Yuck.  Affectionately... Anna
