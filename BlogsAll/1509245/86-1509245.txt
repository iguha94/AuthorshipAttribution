         Kate, I am assuming you are the only person who will understand today's title.   I was in the girl's bathroom today after lunch, when my fellow females and I, in a word, primp. It's a sick trait of being female; every one primps. Especially if you are teenage are a lot of girls who may claim that they, "Oh my gosh, totally don't give a shit about how I look." They are lying. If not to you, then to themselves.  But that's not my point. My point is that I was wondering what everyone was thinking about. Aside from choice of pony-elastic and shade of lip gloss. What they were all thinking about in general. Like, what their morals are. And goals. And beliefs. And secrets. And dreams.   I bet you all the stars in the sky that if you knew me outside of your computer screen, you would not know that I blog. You just wouldn't. My closset friends don't know, and I tell them everything. Everything else, that is.  So, standing wedged between a freshman with a body glitter issue and a junior searching for her contact, I was overcome with a feeling of comradery of the human race. Why? Because Glitter-Fetish-Girl and Former-Four-Eyes had morals, they had goals, beliefs, secrets, dreams. Maybe they didn't type them into a Blog, or write them into a journal. But there thoughts were written in their hearts. It felt poignant. We were alike in our differences.   I make no sense, and I would try to make this post make sense except I love this song so much that I think Rilo Kiley is the best band ever and listening to "The Execution of all Things" seems way more important than trying to be prophetic.   "Soldiers come quickly, I feel the earth beneath my feet..."  Affectionately... Anna
