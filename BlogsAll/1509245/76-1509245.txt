         There is nothing like a Jewish, accomplished guitar and piano playing guy challenging some hip hop fools. Ben Kweller, I just might love you.   Here is an interesting question posed by my entire AP History class: what is the multiple thesis? Thesi? Thesis-es? One would not really think that something would entrance a group of overachieveing, college-anticipating tenth graders as much as that very question. I mean, Alexander T.G. you are awesome, and I have nothing against the Plebians... but how can I concentrate when I have no idea how to pronounce that damn, illusive word!   Guess who TOTALLY does not have an 'A' in math anymore? We all knew it would never last. I have to make up a test, and that might put me in B-range, but I will never see the likes of a ninety-seven percent again. I feel only slightly bad. And by slightly I mean not really bad at all.   Lately I have been annoyed with so many people. I am trying hard not the break. Leigh would not let up today in homeroom. We were voting for homecoming queen, and I decided that I would not vote for one canidate. Leigh would NOT SHUT UP:  "Why aren't you voting for her?  "Leigh, let it go."  "No, I want to know. Tell me."  "Leigh!"  "Tell me, tell me, tell me."  "I'm serious...!"  "I want to know, I want to know. Why won't you tell me? I want to know! Tell me!"   Leigh remains awesome despite her only-child syndrome. I should state that. She is one of my closset friends. And she is terrific, upbeat, and a genuinely good person. But really, sometimes she is so much so I feel like I may get a cavity.   Affectionately... Anna
