Windows XP Professional and Office XP update   Alrighty then.  Can we say HAVING FUN at the OK Coral ?  I thought that I would update my travels down XP udate lane for those of you that might be interested.    I took the time to submit my blog to MANY MANY search engines to widen my drivel horizons in cyberspace.  Right now I believe I have approximately 3 people that read this.  We MUST increase our readership.  I think......  The Office XP install went just fine EXCEPT for file location and load errors in Outlook 2002 (aka version 10).  When Outlook came up it had about 4 different .dll files it was thinking it was supposed to load and never found them.  Therefore it regurgitated while I hit the enter key 5 times.  After much fuss I finally figured out that the only way I was going to get rid of the software configuration nightmare was to log in as administrator on the local box and flush my user profile.  I did that AFTER uninstalling the application suite and cleaning out the registry for each file that was mentioned during the error process.  That did no good.  I even tried to wipe the application suite from my C drive and reinstall in D drive.  Office XP would NOT install to D drive no matter what I did.    Problem solved.  The only ugly part to this is that I lost all of my favorites and my Outlook Express e-mail.  Since I have all of it on my home network it is NO BIG DEAL.  The important thing is that everything is working correctly without errors.  :)
