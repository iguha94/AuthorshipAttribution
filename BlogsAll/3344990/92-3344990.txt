 Robert Half International   On Tuesday I registered with the "Office Team" division of Robert Half International.  I left the house at 8 am and arrived downtown Charleston at approximately 10:15pm.  My appointment was for 9 am.  I tried going down N. Rhett to 526 but ran into a parking lot.  At 8:45 am I finally turned around and took the Rivers Avenue route to I-26 towards Charleston and ran into another parking lot.  Gosh, it was almost as if I should have just stayed in bed.  I perservered and made it to Meeting Street downtown.  I took several exams.  Data Processing, Word, Excel and last but not least typing.  I did 85k keystrokes for Data Entry, scored basic skills for Word and Excel and 70 wpm with 97% accuracy for typing.  That all means that I qualify for a clerical position through Office Team.  Oh yeah, I am so excited about that.  LOL....  I received a call from RHI on Thursday stating that a company is looking for part time help two days a week to handle a company's Ebay business.  I can do that in my sleep so it looks like I atleat have a part time position on Monday's and Tuesday's.  The position is supposed to go permanent within 2 months so we shall see.   Robert Half Technology which is RHI's Technology division is located in Greenville SC in the Upstate.  Jennifer called me from the Greenville branch and told me that the client that has the asset inventory position wants to see what my qualifications are before they make a decision to let me take the 1 or 2 week contract.  I told Jennifer that I was probably WAY OVER qualified for an inventory job.    This is an employers market.  Too many people out of work and not enough jobs to go around.  That means employers can pick and choose the cream of the crop and they dont have to pay people what they are worth not to mention UNDER what the market could bear.
