We are passing through this world to enter into eternity.  Eternity can be a scary thing especially if what it holds for us is uncertain.  Fear is usually fear of the unknown.  Fear can paralyze us and keep us from knowing joy, happiness and contentment with who we are and where we are in life.   Life is a gift and we believe as Christians that God is the giver of this life.  Some of us would further define God in the person of Jesus Christ.  The Bible outlines a plan that God has given us so that we can walk in Abundant Life.   Lets examine some of the scripture that shows us what the bible says about Life and Death.     John 10:9 "I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.  10 "The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.  11 "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.   John 3:14 "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,  15 "that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.  16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.   John 4:14 "but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life."   John 5:24 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.   John 7:14 For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few.   James 1:13 Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one;  14 but each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.  15 Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin; and sin when it is full-grown brings forth death.     The bible is our guide to life.  The bible is our source of originality.  The bible is our authority with regards to the beginning and end of life.  The bible is our guide to living a life of abundance through Christ Jesus our Lord.  Some folks believe that our existence was an accident and that we have evolved from being a cave man to a higher form of life.    I believe that each of us belongs to a global community called humanity.  I believe that God created man and that we are to worship Him.  I believe that God created us to enjoy those things that He has provided us with.  God created us and provided us with everything that we need in order to have abundant life.  I believe that God defines what our needs are through the pages of our bible.   I also believe that we have gotten our needs and wants messed up and our life has gotten out of balance.  I also believe that the evil of this present world has drawn some of us out and separated us from our full potential as Christians.     In an effort to pursue God we have set up different religions and religious denominations with unique definitions of behavior and religious requirements that are necessary in order to find God and have abundant life.    What does life consist of on a personal level?    Eating Sleeping Emotions Thought life Sexual needs Intellect Physiology Religion Personal hygiene Entertainment Education Sports Hobbies Children Work Relationships Perceptions   As Christians we have entered into a personal relationship with God through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  I am not speaking of an emotional guilt or reflex that causes us to behave religiously.  I am talking about our coming face to face with God of the universe because He revealed His plan for us through the reading of His word or by listening to His word being delivered to you through a sermon, bible study or personal testimony of another believer.  When we become Disciples of Christ we move from one relationship into another.  The bible says that we either serve the devil or we serve God.  We have allegiance to either one or the other.  We make a commitment to either one or the other.  We cannot serve God and Satan at the same time.  We have to make a choice that will have eternal circumstances.
