As the old saying goes "When it rains it pours". We have been experiencing a torrential down pour at our house with regards to the garbage that has been happening.    Tuesday afternoon Katy received a call from her work telling her that they were terminating her employment.  Katy lasted two weeks at this job and we both feel as if they did not give her a fair opportunity to address the "supposed" issues.  Katy did the same type of work at MUSC in Charleston without any problems.  We just paid the deposit on a single wide trailer that is 10 minutes from her job and now that job is gone.  Maybe we would not have found the trailer if it had not been for the job?    Yesterday, after we were done with the flea market Katy and the kids took the station wagon over to the new location in Travelers Rest to verify the power had been turned on and the turn on the AC.  Angel, our lab , got loose and was run over by a truck.  Angel is alive but she is not doing that great.  Katy and Kristina were pretty upset about the whole thing.  Angel is like one of the children and is very special to us.  I believe that Angel probably wont play "chicken" with anymore vehicles for some time to come.    Today is the day we take our children to Camp Happy Days for a one week stay.  Justin and Kristina have been counting the days and hours until this week.  I am glad they are actually going to get to go.  While they are gone we will be moving our stuff from Simpsonville out to Travelers Rest.  One positive about this new location is that it is out in the country and is in a very quiet location.
