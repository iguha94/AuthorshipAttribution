Greetings   Slowly but surely we are rebuilding the Jesus Connect web site.  One of the additions that is ready for release is our private newsgroup server.  You can find the following instructions on how to join this private newsgroup server at http://www.jesus-connect.net/faq/faq_13.htm   Send an e-mail to help@jesus-connect.net Provide us with the following information.   Requested Login name and password Real Name Phone Number Address Brief paragraph on why you want to join the newsgroup server This is a private news server and we reserve the right to grant or revoke membership priveleges. Incomplete information will be deleted.   The content of our private newsgroup server will be Christ and family oriented.  There are approximately 20 different topics to choose from.  If you are familiar with the Usenet Newsgroups you will know that it is a wild free for all where anyone can post anything they want unless it is a moderated newsgroup.     Jesus Connect Ministries does have an unmoderated Usenet Newsgroup which can be found at  "Google Groups"  at alt.religion.christian.jesus-connect.  If you visit this newsgroup you will see that there are some folks there that post who love God and have good intentions of sharing the gospel of Christ and then there are those folks who are there to be totally disruptive.  If you are "thick skinned" and can wade through and past some of the ugliness then this would be a good place for you to flex your "apologetics muscles" but if not then our private news server would be the route to go.   God bless         James C. Moffitt Jr.  jcmoffitt1@comcast.net http://www.jesus-connect.net/jcmoffitt/index.html People dont care how much you know until they know how much you care !
