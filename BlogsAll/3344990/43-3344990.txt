Does anyone ever read this drivel?  Do you?  If you do please send me a short note at jcmoffitt@charter.net and tell me so.  If you do that will encourage me to continue my blathering in cyberspace.  :)  Is there such a word as blathering?  Sigh....  Well, week one at our new place in Simpsonville SC is almost complete.  We moved in our new place last Saturday and we are STILL un packing boxes and playing house.  :)  We have a fireplace, 2 bathrooms, a fenced in yard and a kitchen that Katy just loves.  You know what they say.  When mom is happy the whole house is happy.  Well, Katy is pretty happy about our new digs. So the rest of us are living in pleasantville for now.  :)  We really do live out in the country now.   It takes about 5 minutes to get to the ONLY 2 stop and robs down the street but other than that it is a 30 min drive into town.  Wahoo.  We love it!  My new job (contract) is on week number 5.  There were some bumps and glitches along the way but I think that things have smoothed out a bit.  Praise the Lord for that.  Whew.   I was starting to wonder what I had gotten into.  I went from idle to running at mach 3 with my hair on fire.  I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.    Today we will put together a new entertainment unit.  Tomorrow we will look for a new church home.  Actually, tomorrow just starts that maddening process where we go from church to church hoping and praying that we can find where we are supposed to be.  It took us 6 months to do that in Goose Creek and I literally had to wind up in the hospital to meet our new pastor.  Geeesh, hope that does not have to happen this time.  :)  I think that my tummy is calling me to breakfast and I know that I must obey or I will be severely punished.  :)
