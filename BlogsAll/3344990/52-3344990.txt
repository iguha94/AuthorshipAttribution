May 15th 2003 is upon us.  Actually, the day is almost half gone.  What have I accomplished?  Does mowing the backyard and returning consignment computer equipment to my distributer count?  What have you accomplished today?  Recently I upgraded my Gateway PIII 866 mhz workstation to a 1.1 gigglehertz motherboard and 640 mb of ram.  Can you say ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM??  How many people who are supposed computer geeks told me that I would never be able to upgrade my Gateway because it was too proprietary?  More of them than not.  My Gateway is housed in a typical ATX motherboard with a 300 watt power supply.  It was a simple as out with the old and in with the new.  The only problem we ran into was with the case and the front USB cabling.  To get around the proprietary wiring scheme we just put a USB card into an empty pci slot in the back and now I have four USB ports just like before.  The only change is that they are all in the back instead of two in front.  No big deal.    I LOVE how fast this new machine is.  It boots up 3x as fast and the applications are much zippier.  Wahoooo!  When was the last time you ran live update on your Anti Virus software running on your computer?  This serves as a reminder to you if you have not.  There is a new trojan horse virus on the loose and it could come visiting if you use Kazaa or ICQ.
