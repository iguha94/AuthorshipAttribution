How much JUNK do you get in your e-mail inbox??  This is one e-mail that I want to share with the world.  Yes, I am an American too and I am SO very PROUD to be one.  No, our way of life is not perfect and we have our own unique trials and tribulations that we have to work on.  Show me a culture, society or race of peope that do not.....  If you dont like what you see below let me encourage you to find a better place to live.  ______________________________________________________________________   If you want to be an American, then BE AN AMERICAN         After hearing that the state of Florida changed its  opinion and let a Muslim woman have her picture on her  drivers license with her face covered, I believe this is  even more appropriate. Read on, please!   This is an Editorial written by an American citizen,  published in a Tampa Newspaper. He did quite a job; didn't  he?   IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS, MUST ADAPT.   I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are  offending some individual or their culture.   Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, we have  experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of  Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely  settled when the "politically correct" crowd began  complaining about the possibility that our patriotism was  offending others.   I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge  against anyone who is seeking a better life by coming to  America. Our population is almost entirely composed of  descendants of immigrants. However, there are a few things  that those who have recently come to our country, and  apparently some born here, need to understand. This idea of  America being a multicultural community has served only to  dilute our sovereignty and our national identity.   As Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our  own language and our own lifestyle. This culture has been  developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and  victories by millions of men and women who have sought  freedom.   We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese,  Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to  become part of our society, LEARN THE LANGUAGE! "In God We  Trust" is our national motto. This is not some Christian,  right wing, political slogan. We adopted this motto because  Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded  this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is  certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our  schools.   If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another  part of the world as your new home, because God is part of  our culture. If Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't  like Uncle Sam, then you should seriously consider a move  to another part of this planet.   We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change,  and we really don't care how you did things where you came  from. This is OUR COUNTRY, our land, and our lifestyle.  Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to  express his opinion and we will allow you every opportunity  to do so.   But, once you are done complaining, whining, and griping  about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way  of life, I highly encourage you to take advantage of one  other great American freedom, THE RIGHT TO LEAVE.   Please pass this along if you agree.
