We have twelve days to move.  Our landlord informed us that his soon to be ex wife owns the rental property that we are in and that she needs to move in since they are separated now.  We cant really afford the house anyway and knew that we needed to move to something cheaper.  This is forcing us to do the move now instead of in October.  The search for a place to stay is in full swing.  Thus far everyone wants first and last month rent to move in.  My money tree is bare so that is not going to work for us.    We are having a moving sale and listing things on Iwanna.com to see if we can generate some extra income and lighten our moving load.  In August of 1997 we sold everything we owned and moved to Douglasville Georgia.  It took us almost 7 years to reaquire everything we sold.  I told Katy that this was the last time I am doing this.  No more working to acquire stuff that I am just going to have to sell anyway.    Our home phone is off and the cell phone and Internet connection will go next unless we can find the funds to pay the bills soon.  If that happens we should be back online within 4 to 6 weeks.  If you are reading this and we have your home phone number we will be in contact during that time to let you know how we are doing.    On the bright side of things Katy does have a job and I do have unemployment coming in until Feb of 2004.  Those two things keep us from being totally indigent.  PTL for that aye?    I know that we are not alone and that there are other folks that are in a pickle just like us.  All we know is that we need a rest from this constant barrage of life changing events. We are weary since everything seems to be happening all at the same time.  We need a break.    Come soon Lord Jesus come soon.  I think that this family is more than ready....
