I went to post a praise report this morning in the Praise Report message phorum on Jesus Connect and noticed the following.    Prayer requests has 219 messages Praies Reports has 17 messages  What does that mean folks?  That means that we spend more time asking God for help than we spend in thanking HIM for what HE has already done.  We need to remember to be just as quick to thank HIM for the many blessings that we get no matter how small or common we think they are.   Think about this.  Here are things that we take for granted in America  Food Clothing roof over our heads  (some of us have VERY NICE roofs) vehicle(s) to drive jobs to go to running water electricity sewage service gas service cable or satellite tv radio stations trash pick up Internet computers Home entertainment  Church building to go to for services Church events in non hostile environment our health our families and being able to see them or talk to them via telephone US Postal Service Our governmental services that we whine about all the time  What am I forgetting here folks?  I am sure there is something that I forgot but you are getting the point.  We need to be just as excited about praising God as we are asking Him for assistance.  We need to feel the same amount of urgency to tell Abba Father and ourselves about GOOD stuff that happens in our lives.   Why do we horde all the cool stuff to ourselves and share all the junk in our lives?  Think about it for a second.     What are you thankful for?  You ask for prayer but you never report back about God's provision and answer to your prayer.  Yes, God sometimes says NO.  God tells us NO because sometimes HE teaches us through patience that we ask things foolishly.  We should be thankful that God does say no.  What IF we did get EVERYTHING that we do ask for?  That would be a very scary thing indeed.   Lets determine to have an attitude of gratitude in the year 2002 and increase our praise reports to match our prayer requests !  God bless
