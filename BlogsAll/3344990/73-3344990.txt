 Blog Speak author requesting donations   If you click on the above link you will see the e-mail that the author of blogspeak sent out to his subscribers.  Here we have a software programmer who is apparently quite talented that does several things.  He creates this service called  Blog Speak  so that folks like you can  add comments  to online  web logs .  He also provides the service free of charge to all of us.  He states on his website that the service is free but donations are welcome.  This software author actually pays an ISP to co host this service on one of their servers for a specific fee which he pays out of his pocket.  Now that Blog Speak is becoming more popular and the activity has picked up the ISP has taken notice and either wants this guy to upgrade his subscription for the service or they are going to shut him off.    I had $1.19 in my PayPal account this evening.  I have been out of work for 7 months and even though I dont have much I feel that if those people who benefit from this program will donate only 1.00 that he will be able to raise enough money to upgrade his service.  The PayPal e-mail address to send donations to is blogspeak@bighar.com.  If you can spare some extra change for this service I am sure that he would appreciate it.
