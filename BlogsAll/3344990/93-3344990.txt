Have you recovered from gorging yourself full of Turkey and all the trimmings yet?  Maybe you are still slumbering and have not awakened yet after collapsing into your recliner or favorite couch yesterday afternoon.  Our family went to the Meritage Restaurant in downtown Charleston SC yesterday and were blessed by the owner and his staff who volunteered their time, talents, food and facility so that our group from Happy Days and Special Times could enjoy a fabulous Thanksgiving dinner and fellowship.  There were approximately 45 people who attended and the family that traveled the farthest was from Pensacola Florida.    We came home after filling ourselves with some wonderful food and settled down in front of the television to watch the Miami Dolphins feed the Dallas Cowgirls to the sharks. Can you say OH MY GOSH.  What about those Cowgirls?  The Dallas defense who is ranked number one (not any more) in the NFC East acted as if they could not stop the run or the pass.  The score (cough) was 40 to 21 in the Dolphins favor.  Now the Cowboys are 8 wins and 4 losses which I believe takes them out of first place in the NFC East (2nd place perhaps) and Miami is now 8 wins and 3 losses which puts them in a good standing for a wildcard position in the AFC.    This weekend will find us at the Happy Days and Special Times reunion that is held the weekend after Thanksgiving every year in Charleston.  This year, since we moved back we wont need to stay in the hotel so we can show up for the festivities and then come home and sleep in our own beds which will be nice.   If you were like most Americans you were out shopping at Wallyworld or one of the malls in your location at the wonderful hour of 5 or 6 am as you went toe to toe with all of the other shoppers trying to cash in on the early bird deals.  As for me and my house we were fast asleep with the visions of James finding a job some day soon.  Our Christmas will be so wonderful if we can just manage to pay the bills and not have anything cut off or canceled due to non payment.  As a matter of fact I just got off the phone with a recruiter who is searching for a Network Administrator in the SC area.  They want a 4 year degree and certifications but perhaps if I pass their online screening and telephone interviews they might waive the educational prerequisite and trade out for years of experience and knowledge.  We shall see how I do on the online screen test first.   In lieu of fighting with holiday shoppers for this or that we stayed home and managed to get our Christmas tree up along with most of the other holiday trappings.  I have SEVERAL pictures to show you but for the complete list of pictures you can go to   Thanksgiving Pictures for your enjoyment  and there you will see the entire list of 30 + pictures that I took in the last day or two.  If you click on each picture from that web page you will view the picture in your web browser of choice.
