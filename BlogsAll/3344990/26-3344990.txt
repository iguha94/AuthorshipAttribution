Ding Dong the SPAM will DIE!!   If you traipse over to     you can download a 30 day shareware version of Spam Killer.  I installed the application at  home and LOVE IT.  Here are the instructions I gave out to our Jesus Connect Help Desk phorum last night. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  If you are as sick of SPAM as I am check this application out. Here is what I have learned thus far.  A. allow the program to import your contact list into the "Friends List" B. set up all your e-mail accounts with appropriate user name, server names and passwords C. go into Friends List and cull out the ones that you dont want to come through automatically  D. go into your Email client and TURN OFF automatic checking.  Spam Killer automatically checks your pop3 server for new mail.  Spam Killer applies included "filters" to determine IF this is spam or not Spam Killer will ALWAYS allow any email address in your friends list Spam Killer deletes suspected spam off the pop3 server BUT saves the email to the Kill folder so you can restore it if you need to. Spam Killer allows you to create your own specific filters on the fly  You will have to MANUALLY check your e-mail from your E-mail client to get the e-mail off of the pop3 email server.   Spam Killer is shareware to be used for thirty days. If you like it, register it on their website for 29.95.  Enjoy !!
