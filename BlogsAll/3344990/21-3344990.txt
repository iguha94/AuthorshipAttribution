We have a married man message phorum on Jesus Connect which is in the Battle Plan Ministries Message Group.   The men have started a conversation about pornography addiction in this Married Men phorum.  I told them that we have specific message phorums for that type of conversation already.  I outlined ten categories for them to find something else to talk about.    In an effort to give you a better picture (word) of who I am here are my answers to these categories.  A. our children  Jeremy Moffitt, age 15, lives in Houston Texas with his mom Kristina Lynn Moffitt, 9, lives with me , home schooled for now Justin Matthew Moffitt 6, lives with us here, home schooled for now Jessica Ann Moffitt, would have been 11 on September 11, 2001, with the Lord now   B. our career  LAN Manager for the Public Works Department on the Charleston Naval Weapons Station.  I have been here in this job since October of 2001. Before that I was the Network Administrator for the local newspaper in Charleston called The Post and Courier.  I have been in the IT industry for about 12 years.  I love working with technology.  Before that I was in law enforcement in Texas and owned a small mom and pop cleaning company with my wife.   C. our education  I have a high school degree, some college, some hands on training.    D. our church activities as married men  Pulpit ministry Audio/Video  usher parking lot attendant when needed punching bag for the pastor when he needs me to be.    E. our relationship with our wife  Happily married for 12 + years. Very much in love with my wife Katy.  She is my best friend and an awesome person to have put up with me all this time.  We are like peas and carrots.  Not sure who is what though.   We have been through some things that would have blown most relationships wide open.  Having God in our relationship and a serious committement to the marriage has made us stronger.     F. our hobbies  I love to fish.  I go off shore from time to time on the East Coast. I love photography.  I love to read, my favorite fiction author is Tom Clancy.  I love to read and study God's word. I love to preach and teach God's word. I spend a lot of time online in ministry when I am not doing something at the church. I am learning how to bowl.  I just recently got serious and bought a new ball that hooks. My average is 117 on a good day.  :(  I love astronomy.  We got a telescope for Christmas.  I love to play spades and a domino game called 42 and chess.  G. our OTHER addictions  FOOD.  FOOD.  FOOD.....  I have an ongoing battle with learning how to change my life habits with regards to eating.  We are going to sponsor Weigh Down Workshop at our church so that we can loose weight.  I did this before and lost 40 lbs.  H. our FEARS  Going through another divorce Loosing another child to cancer Not seeing Jessica again should Christianity turn out to be not true loosing Katy to illness   I. our DREAMS  To be content in every day living.  To become debt free.  To loose weight so I can have more energy and feel better.  To see more and more people come to the Lord.  To be a good dad to my children.     J. our EXPECTATIONS  I hope that my faith in God is for real.  I expect my wife to be faithful to me and to always be by my side I expect my children to be relatively obedient  I expect my children to be attentive to the lessons that I can teach them about life I expect to be real with people so that they can see Jesus in me I expect my friends to be totally honest with me and never lie to me I expect my relationship with Christ to grow on a daily basis I expect my relationships to be good ones        James Moffitt Jesus Connect Ministries http://www.jesus-connect.net jcmoffitt@jesus-connect.net
