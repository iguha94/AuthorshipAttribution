Can you believe that it is already May 1st 2002?  I for one can not.  Where oh where is time going to?  When I was younger I heard that time flies by faster and faster the older you get.  At the age of 40 this is really coming true in an alarming way.  If you are older than me then you know what I am talking about.    On May 5th we will have been without our Jessica for 9 months. Walking through Grief Year 1 is an article in response to that milestone in our lives.  Maybe I should call it a month stone instead of a mile stone.  Is there such a thing?  Katy has been working at MUSC now for about 2 weeks and today is her first paycheck out side of the home in approximately 7 years.  On May 12th of this year Katy and I will be celebrating 12 years of marriage and on May 4th of this year our Kristina will be turning 10 years old.   Justin and Kristina seem to be adjusting to public school ok.  We agree with the teacher that Justin needs to do 1st grade over again since he will be turning 7 next year.  This wont hurt him at all.  We are planning on going back to Texas in June for the first time in two years.  It will be good to see the relatives again.  We will go to Seguin Texas which is just outside of San Antonio to see Katy's sister, Lisa.    We are planning on finding a house to rent between now and July 1st of this year.  We are ready to move from where we are at and find a bigger place with a fenced in yard for the children and our dog angel to play in.      James Moffitt http://jcmoffitt jcmoffitt@jcmoffitt.com
