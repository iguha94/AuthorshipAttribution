Marlon Brando & Eccentricity                            Just finished reading a book called Naked eye by Desmond Morris. Naked Eye is an interesting study in Human Behaviour. Found this piece interesting. Morris writes about his strange meeting with Brando. The eccentricities of Marlon Brando are Legendary. Arguably one of the Greatest Actors of 20th Century , he has had more than his share of Controversies.                                                                                 Desmond Morris here writes about one of the eccentricities of Brando "Brando says he has no sense of time. Time means nothing to him. Once , he told me , he was buying drinks at a liquor store and had to pay by cheque. He did not know the date , so he said to the man behind the counter : 'It's the 12th? ''No," replied the man, 'it's the 5th'. 'Ah' , said Brando , 'the 5th April , thank you' .'No,''replied the man , 'the 5th of March.''Could you check the price of that bottle up there on the top shelf?'asked Brando . While the man climbed the ladder , Brando was able to sneak a look at the newspaper , lying on the counter , to find out what year it was.
