La Vita e Bella (Life is Beautiful)                                                      Watched the amazing movie "Life is Beautiful" today . A wonderful tale of Romance,Humor & Nazi Concentration camps. The first half is refreshing with humor and attempts by Roberto Benigni to woo his girlfriend. Humor forms a part of the second half too against a grim backdrop of Nazi Concentration camp. Benigni's charm,optimism and his vow to protect the soul of his son pervade throughout the movie. The Background music score wonderfully complements the stunning Roman visuals. The movie is a stark contrast to most of the Jewish Holocaust movies since it uses Humor & Optimism to portray a poignant tale. Its tough to decide whether Roberto Benigni outshines as an Actor or Director (Although he got an Oscar for Best Actor , I would say the directorial touch was excellent) . The Kid is cute and Nicoletta looks ravishing.                                                           I saw this movie a few years back in Italian with English subtitles.However today thankfully saw the dubbed version which made me understand a few nuances which I had missed earlier. Would highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it . Please do see & realize what good Cinema is all about.
