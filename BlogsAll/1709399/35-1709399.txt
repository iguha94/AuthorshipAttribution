INDIA - The Next Superpower ?                                          Suddenly the nation is filled with an overwhelming optimism. The Stock markets are at a all time High, Business are doing extremely well (Both Old & new economy) , The rainfall has been good this monsoon , Service sector jobs have seen a tremendous growth . So are we now what Japan was in the 60's & 70's ( On the Threshold of Superstardom) ? Here is a Quick analysis by me :   1. IT , ITES , BPO : There never has been a greater time to be in this sector. Every MNC wants to outsource to India and the Indian talent is being glossed over by the Western Media & MNC's. In spite of the nascent backlash in the US , things look quite upbeat . The best thing about IT jobs is that the quality of work is amazing in India these days ( TI,Intel,Oracle, Motorola ) .    2. Pharma : The Indian Giants are spreading their wings Globally . Ranbaxy,Dr.Reddy , Sun Pharma , CIPLA , Wockhardt all are fighting for a share in the Global markets & competing with low cost drugs . Even on the R&D front we aren't far behind. More than 50% of revenues are from Global sales.   3. Automobile & Manufacturing : City Rover is Tata Indica. M&M tractor sales in the US are impressive. TVS Group is the only second non Japanese company to win coveted Deming prize twice. Moser bear makes optical discs which are used by 11 of 12 big manufacturers. GM,Ford,Chrysler are looking at outsourcing parts worth $1.5 Billion from India .   4. Textiles : Arvind Mills and other Denim successes and Reliance in Polyester & yarn.                                              The list goes on & on & on(Oil , Cement , Entertainment) ............ So can we make it ? What are the Hurdles curtailing India ? More on it later.
