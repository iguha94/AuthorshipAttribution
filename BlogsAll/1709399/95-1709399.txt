Time to Kill - Hitchcock,Pyaasa,John Grisham                       My medical test results are coming only on Friday (I can proceed with my immigration only after this) and hence had a lot of time to kill yesterday & today.Most of which was spent on reading the latest John Grisham novels - The Summons & King of Torts.Also read the Autobiography of David Ogilvy and few Travel books on Singapore & South east Asia.                    My uncle has a great collection of movies.Saw Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope" day before yesterday.Saw Guru Dutt's " Pyaasa" yesterday.   PYAASA :  What a movie ! Dark,poignant and mesmerising like his personal life "Pyaasa" is an immortal classic and one of my favourite movies.The heart-wreching story of a young,poor poet "Pyaasa" is Guru dutt's whip to the Social Hypocrisy that exists in Indian society.Waheeda Rehman is ravishing and Johnny walker plays a commendable cameo role.The pulse of the movie is its immortal lyrics by Sahir and music by S.D.Burman.Be it the Chirpy " Jaane Kya Tune" or the funny " Sar Jo Tera" or the haunting " Jaane Woh Kaise" , " Yeh Duniya agar" Dada Burman reigns Supreme.The Vocals of Mohd.Rafi,Geeta Dutt and Hemantda ( Jaane Woh kaise - What wonderful singing) add great value to the music.                   But the film belongs to Guru Dutt , the director and Sahir , the Lyricist.The narrative style is excellent and perhaps way ahead of its times.Sahir has poured his heart with lyrics like " Jinhe Naaz hai hind par woh Kahaan" , " Humne tho jab kaliyan maangi thi kaaton ka haar mila" , " yeh duniya agar mil bhi tho kya hai" . The movie is a Classic and easily rates as one of the top ten Hindi movies of all times.
