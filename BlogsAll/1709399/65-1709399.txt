Corporate Social Responsibility                                                            Here is an article that I wrote on Corporate Social Responsibility for my company's in house Magazine.    SSC - Corporate social responsibility   "India is Shining" proclaim the newspaper Ads.The knowledge workers from India are transforming the Globe and the Services Sector is booming at an incredible rate. As India strives to emerge as the next super power, it still reels under the weight of its 260 million people living below the poverty line. The greatest challenge for the nation going forward is to abridge the deep chasm between the rich and the poor. Vision 2020 is not merely the statement of the President , its an oath worth pursuing for every Indian.                     Corporate Social responsiveness is emerging as a beacon of light in India as companies endeavor to work for the under-privileged & poor. CSC India has been doing a wonderful job in contributing its mite to the upliftment of the under-privileged through its Social Services Committee (SSC).                    At SSC , we have :   1. Helped Schools with Infrastructure & materials.  2. Organized Blood Donation Camps 3. Participated in Pulse Polio & Hepatitis-B vaccination drives. 4. Donated Clothes to the poor  5. Raised awareness on safe driving  6. Conducted health check-ups in slums                             As Gandhiji Said "you must be the change you wish to see in the world".Social service starts at an individual,extends to the family,then to the society and ultimately to the Nation. Let us all redeem our tryst with destiny and pledge our support to social causes to uplift the nation towards its goal of economic & social prosperity.                                                                      At SSC , what we have done till now is just a drop in the Ocean.However , with all your whole hearted Support & encouragement we hope to achieve more and catapult our nation towards prosperity.  As Robert Frost said " The woods are dark,lovely & deep. But I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep,and miles to go before I sleep".
