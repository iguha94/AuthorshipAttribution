IN DEFENSE OF GOD                                                                        One of the fwd mails that I received. But this one caught my attention & is thought provoking.   An atheist professor of philosophy speaks to his  class on the problem science has with Krishna.  He asks one of his new students Gopal  to stand and.....  Professor: You are a Hare Krishna  devotee, aren't you, son? Gopal:  Yes, sir.  Prof: So you believe in  God? Gopal: Absolutely, sir.  Prof: Is God good? Gopal:  Sure.  Prof: Is God all-powerful? Gopal:  Yes.  Prof: My brother died of cancer even  though he prayed to Krishna to heal him. Most of us would attempt to help others  who are ill. But Krishna didn't. How is this Krishna good then?  Hmm? (Gopal  is silent.)  Prof: You can't answer, can you?  Let's start again, young fella. Is God good? Gopal:Yes.  Prof: Is Satan  good? Gopal:No.  Prof: Where does Satan come  from? Gopal: From...God...  Prof: That's right. Tell me son, is  there evil in this world? Gopal: Yes.  Prof: Evil is everywhere, isn't it?  And God did make everything. Correct? Gopal: Yes.  Prof: So who created  evil? (Gopaldoes not answer.)  Prof: Is there sickness? Immorality?  Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things exist in the world, don't  they? Gopal:Yes, sir.  Prof: So, who created them? (Gopal  has no answer.)  Prof: Tell me, son. Do you believe in  Krishna? Gopal:Yes, professor, I do.  Prof: Science says you have 5 senses  you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you ever seen  Krishna? Gopal:  No, sir.  Prof: Tell us if you have ever heard  your Krishna? Gopal: Yes , sir.  Prof: Have you ever felt your  Krishna, tasted your Krishna, smelt your Krishna? Have you ever had any sensory  perception of Krishna or God for that matter? Gopal: No, sir. I'm afraid I  haven't.  Prof: Yet you still believe in  Him? Gopal: Yes.  Prof: According to empirical,  testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your Krishna doesn't exist. What  do you say to that, son? Gopal:Nothing. I only have my faith.  Prof: Yes. Faith. And that is the  problem science has.  Gopal: Professor, is there such a  thing as heat? Prof: Yes.  Gopal:And is there such a thing as  cold? Prof: Yes.  Gopal: No sir. There  isn't.  (The lecture theatre becomes very  quiet with this turn of events.)  Gopal: Sir, you can have lots of  heat, even more heat, superheat, mega heat, white heat, a little heat or no  heat. But we don't have anything called cold. We can hit 458 degrees below zero  which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing  as cold. Cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot  measure cold. Heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir just the absence of it.  (There is pin-drop silence in the  lecture theatre.)  Gopal: What about darkness,  Professor? Is there such a thing as darkness? Prof: Yes. What is night if there  isn't darkness?  Gopal: You're wrong again, sir.  Darkness is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light,  bright light, flashing light.....But if you have no light constantly, you have  nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? In reality, darkness isn't. If it  were you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?  Prof: So what is the point you are  making, young man?  Gopal: Sir, my point is your  philosophical premise is flawed.  Prof: Flawed? Can you explain  how?  Gopal: Sir, you are working on the  premise of duality. You argue there is life and then there is death, a good God  and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something  we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a  thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully  understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant  of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the  opposite of life: just the absence of it. Now tell me, Professor. Do you teach  your students that they evolved from a monkey?  Prof: If you are referring to the  natural evolutionary process, yes, of course, I do. Gopal :  Have you ever observed  evolution with your own eyes, sir?  (The Professor shakes his head with a  smile, beginning to realize where the argument is going.) Gopal : Since no one has ever  observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this  process is an on-going endeavour, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are  you not a scientist but a preacher? (The class is in  uproar.)  Gopal : Is there anyone in the class  who has ever seen the Professor's brain? (The class breaks out into  laughter.) Gopal : Is there anyone here who has  ever heard the Professor's brain, felt it, touched or smelt it?.....No one  appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical,  stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain,  sir.  With all due respect, sir, how do we  then trust your lectures, sir? (The room is silent. The professor  stares at the student, his face unfathomable..)  Prof: I guess you'll have to take  them on faith, son. Gopal : That is it sir.. The link  between man & god is FAITH. That is all that  keeps things moving & alive
