Rukmini Devi Arundale                                          I was fortunate enough to attend a lec-dem on Creativity by Bhartanatyam dansue Padmashri Leela Samson last week. She was a very eloquent speaker who was Humility personified & attributed most of her success to her Guru Rukmini Devi Arundale.                                                         This year is the Birth Centenary year of the Multifaceted Iconoclast Rukmini Devi Arundale , the founder of Kalakshetra (The famous Dance School at Chennai ). Read about some of her towering achievements in the recent issue of India Today and was amazed by her versatility & achievements . Here are a few to list :   1. Was offered the Presidentship of India in 1977 by Morarji Desai which she resolutely refused.   2. As a Rajya Sabha Member was responsible for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal Act & Montessori method of Teaching.   3. As a 16-year old Tam-Bram Girl she breaked the tradition by marrying George S. Arundale , a Brit 20 years her senior.   4. Started learning Bharatanatyam at 29 ( a very late age ) but pioneered the Dance drama Genre & gave respectability to Dance . Founded Kalakshetra , the Dance School which is the cradle of the modern Dance movement in the South.
