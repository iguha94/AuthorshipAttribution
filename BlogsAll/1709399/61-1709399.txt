MyDoom - Worm                    Internet these days is a dangerous place. The Mydoom virus has now officially been declared as the most destructive Virus ever,causing Billions of Dollars in Loss. The Variant A caused the SCO Site to be shut down on Monday due to Denial of Service Attacks. The Variant B targeted Microsoft website today but petered out due to inferior code. However, the most worrying statistic is that 20% of all emails circulated on internet were Mydoom emails (During its peak infection period) . As someone, who has worked as a Security Admin warding off Spam & viruses , I have had my fair share of fire-fighting with the Viruses,worms & spam and know how virulent they can be.                                       To think that an Hacker could Blackmail SCO and be successful ( SCO couldn't ward off the attack though they knew a few days before the day of attack) , proves that Internet could have finally met its nemesis in itself. Both Microsoft & SCO have announced $2,50,000 as reward for anyone helping to catch the Hacker responsible for this attack. For those wondering why SCO & MS have been targeted , the answer is, right now these two are the biggest enemies to the Open Source movement ( MS becos of obvious reasons & SCO becos of Intellectual property squabble with IBM over Linux Licensing ) .                                        The Spam is still thriving & continues to grow. Out of the 100 mails I receive in a day in various mail accounts almost 95 are spam. Unless we rein in Worms,viruses & spam,the internet will continue to remain a murkier world where anything is possible.
