CLEAN,GREEN DELHI                                                         That is the motto of the DDA (Delhi Development Authority) . This weekend I got to see the good side of Delhi (The one sans pollution,Traffic Jam) . After the NDTV Shooting on Saturday ,  Venkat & I headed to a South Indian Restaurant "Nayvedhyam" in Hauz Khas , Delhi. The restaurant had great ambiance filled with Tanjore paintings & wonderful south Indian Thali served in authentic Plantain leaf .                                      We then headed to the Deer Park. The Deer park was  recently in the news for its overcapacity of Deers (The authorities were considering Sterilizing the deers to control over-crowding) . The park had hundreds of Spotted Deers , a few Nilghais & plenty of Rabbits and ducks. We crossed over to the Rose Garden which is a dream spot for joggers & walkers. The Roses were in all colors and in full Bloom . I took plenty of snaps with my SLR camera. The trees and the gentle breeze make this place a must visit for any nature lover.                                             We then drove to the "Garden of five Senses"in Mehrauli (near Qutab-Minar) . Its a park dedicated to the five senses of Humans viz Sight,Hearing,Touch,Smell,Taste. It had tastefully ornated gardens , Cacti,Bamboos and Solar power units. Its a very quiet place far from the chaos of Delhi and a great place to spend an evening.                        Already DDA has done a wonderful job by quadrupling trees in last 5 years and with such gardens Delhi truly has the potential to regain its status as the Metro of choice to the tourists.
