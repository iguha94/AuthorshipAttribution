US Democratic Presidential Candidates                                                        John Kerry has won it. Almost . The Iowa & New hampshire results have given a surprising win for Kerry which he has further consolidated in the last few days. Howard Dean , surprisingly has done rather badly in the elections with Joe Lieberman & Wesley Clark now distant in the race. Al Gore's VP Nominee , Joe Lieberman , had he won would have been the first Jewish to contest the US Presidential polls. (Had it happened , a rather unprecedented surprise even bigger than JFK , a Roman Catholic winning the US Elections) . Afterall the US President is one of the most powerful man on earth and hence this Elections is of immense interest to everyone & also let us see if Saddam's capture can save Bush from Defeat.                                       On a Humorous Note, its been a great time for the American Late Night shows with Dem Elections . Here are some quotes from the Tonight show with Jay Leno :   1. Today in the "L.A. Times, one critic wrote that the problem with John Kerry "is he looks like he thinks too much. Well you won't hear anyone accusing President Bush of that.  2. Today Dennis Kucinich vowed to stay in the presidential race. "Stay in? How about get in?   3. Howard Dean was out talking about health care today it has nothing to do with the campaign, I think he realizes he is going back to being a doctor real soon.   4. You all excited about this big Democratic race heating up? In his big victory speech the other night, Senator John Kerry said he wanted to defeat George Bush and "the economy of privilege." And then he hugged his wife, Teresa, heir to the multimillion-dollar Heinz food fortune.   5. General Wesley Clark has spoken out both in favor and against the decision to go to war with Iraq. In fact, this weekend in South Carolina, he'll be debating himself.  6. Lieberman did well in the exit polls. Every poll said he should exit.
