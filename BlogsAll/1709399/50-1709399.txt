The Futility of War                                                          A Confession first . Seeing a Bollywood War movie gives me no expertise to comment on what happened at Kargil or on what war is all about . But there is no denial about the Futility of lives being lost because of enmity & hatred.                                                       Saw the Movie LOC - Kargil yesterday . It was an epic movie spanning four Hours . The movie leaves most Indians with a feeling of Patriotism & exhilaration . The Locations are terrific and most of the Star Cast ( Its almost a who-is-who of Bollywood ) has acted very well particularly Ajay Devgan & Saif Ali Khan . But on the downside it has portrayed the war as a one-sided story with expletives thrown liberally all over the movie.                                                       I have always had great admiration for people in the Defence forces. I like their immense self-confidence & discipline and their patriotism in serving the Nation.                                                       If you allow your Head to rule your heart , you start wondering why the heck are so many people fighting over something which if given the right initiatives could be solved peacefully. Mutilation , maiming , Torture all is fair in war . Is that what a sane thinking individual would resort to ? Consider the Billions of Rupees which India & pak would have spent on these wars which otherwise could have been used for their country's Development . War is never a solution .                                   I remember this Classic War Quote by Benjamin Franklin  "There never was a good war or a bad peace".
