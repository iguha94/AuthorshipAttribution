Frasers Hill - Malaysia       Its a beautiful,quiet little Hillstation with pristine beauty & unspolit environs.Fraser's Hill is about 105km north of Kuala Lumpur. It was built on seven hills, just like the ancient city of Rome. Its unbelievably quite &amp; calm with a variety of Outdoor activities to offer.        When to go ?  Any time of the year, but best times are between March and September.       How to go ?  Overland via Kuala Kubu Baru (TR 55) and then take the junction at the "Gap" for Fraser's Hill. The last 8 kms from the Gap to Fraser's Hill is a regulated road allowing only one-way traffic, uphill (odd hours) and downhill (even hours), by daylight (It is not advisable to make this leg of the journey at night).        Attractions :  Trail walking and treks, bird watching, photography.There is also a Golf Course (9 Hole),Horse-riding & Waterfalls.The annual International Bird-watching contest attracts large number of tourists during the month of June every year. The Silver park apartments (Where we stayed) also offers facilities like Archery,Trekking,Nature Walks etc.        Personal Experiences :  I have never seen a more quiet town than this.The Trails are exciting and offer you a glimpse of the famed Malaysian Rain forests.The Tall trees and thick shrubs are densely populated, creating one of the thickest vegetation I have ever witnessed.I was unlucky not to spot much birds .The Jeriau Waterfalls is a great place where the water gushes at a very high speed (I felt as if stones were falling on me under the falls ! ).Visit the WWF office in the Market place and they help you a lot in planning your treks.On the way back we drove through Kualalumpur downtown &amp; saw the famed Petronas Towers (The Tallest building in the planet until recently).        Afterthoughts :  Perhaps I should come back to Frasers Hill during the Annual Bird Watching contest. That should be fun.Also KL(Kualalumpur) was just a fleeting visit and I shall try to go back there sometime before the end of this year.
