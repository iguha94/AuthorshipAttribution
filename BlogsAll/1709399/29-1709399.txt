Peter Principle                               A few weeks back I was having a discussion with a friend of mine about Work profile in US & India. In US we have colleagues who have been working as Tech Support guys for 25 years , pretty much doing the same thing over the years . Most of them do not want to get promoted and like what they are doing.                                       Whereas in India once someone has more than 6 + years of experience in IT he either becomes a Team Lead or PM . Now where is the justification that a good techie will make a Good Manager . Because in most cases these guys hardly know the nuances of Management and end up getting disparaged for no fault of theirs ( Most of them never asked for a manager promotion and would have been happy being a Techie ) . We rarely see people who still write Code at the age of 40 in India .                                                             Reminds me of Peter Priniciple " In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence " Here is a concise   article  on it.
