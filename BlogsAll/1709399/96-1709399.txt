PERSONAL EXPERIENCES  : I was on a casual one day visit from Munnar (90 kms) and hence didn't get much time to trek.But the boat ride was awesome and perhaps one of the best I have ever had.I spotted a big Indian Hornbill & numerous grey herons,cormorants,kingfishers,mynahs .I also saw lot of Deers,a group of otters,turtles,Bisons.I was also lucky to get a very close photograph of a giant Malabar Squirrel.Thekkady is a great place if you love wildlife .
