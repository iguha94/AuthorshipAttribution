SAHIR                                                              This is perhaps my first post on one of my favourite topics - Music & Ghazals . Was Listening to the Song "Kabhie Kabhie " the other day & once again much more than the wonderful music of the song , what struck me were the Lyrics of the Immortal Sahir . I have always founds his Lyrics to be Straight & Direct , which means that the lyrics hit at you and you could feel the bitterness & anger behind them .  He minces no words in expressing the Decadence of social values or in the Flagrant displays of the Rich & wealthy . He was a very proud man & remained a Bachelor throughout his life.  ( It was rumoured that he insisted on getting one Rupee more than what Lata Charges to sing a song because he had so much faith in himself & his lyrics )  .                                               Here are a few of his songs which rank among my favourites & the lyrics as usual are mesmerising :   1. Jaane Vo Kaise Log the Jinko Pyaar ( From the movie "Pyaasa"  - Its a combination of Geniuses at work Guru Dutt - SDBurman - Hemant  & Sahir ) . I particularly like the Words " Humne Tho Jab Kaliyan Maangi Thi Kaaton ka Har Mila ( Whenever I asked for flowers , all I got in return were the Pricks of the Thorns ) . This Movie & song is almost a Auto biographical sketch of Both Sahir & Guru Dutt.  2. Kabhie Kabhie -- As much as he is known for his hard hitting lyrics , he has also penned some wonderful Romantic numbers . " Tu ab se pehle Sitaron main Bas Rahi Thi Kahin , Tujhe Zameen pe Bulaya Gaya hey mere liye ".   3. Abhi Na Jao (From Hum Dono) -- One of the best Duets I have listened to with both Rafi & Asha reigning supreme. The Lyrics are mesmerising as usual.   4. Yeh Desh hai Veer (Naya Daur) -- Patriotic Lyrics . This one is an ode to Bharat Matha.   5. Yeh Raat Yeh Chandini (Jaal) -- Hemant Kumar's soothing voice & wonderful lyrics of sahir . Listen to this "â€™laharon ke honThon pe dhiimaa dhiimaa raag hai bhiigii havaaon mein ThanDii ThanDii aag hai is hasiin aag mein tuu bhii jalake dekhale zindagii ke giit kii dhun badal ke dekhale "  6. Zindagi Bhar Nahin (Barsaat Ki Raat) -- One of Rafi's best Solos. Madhubala's looks ravishing but its Sahir who finally rules.                     And many many more. Will try to post more on such topics later.
