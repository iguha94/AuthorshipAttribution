Indian Legal system ?                                                     The Delhi High court in a judgement today acquitted all public servants including Rajiv Gandhi from the Bofors Scandal. Most of the prime Accused in the case are already dead. I am wondering how the judge felt announcing a verdict acquitting a person who has been dead for 13 years now. How ridiculous is that ?? The Indian Legal system with its Lakhs of pending cases needs a complete overhaul. Imagine a Judge sitting in the Chair and announcing in 2004  " I pronounce as Guilty Mr.X for the Theft he committed on August 30th , 1987 in the Y case " . Come on , give us a break.                        When Arun Jaitley , an eminent lawyer himself , took over as the Law Minister a few years back there were lots of expectations that the legal system would be modified to deliver swift decisions which are of chronological relevance. But nothing much seemed to have Changed.                                         It is said "Justice delayed is Justice Denied" . Hope the Indian Legal system gets a much needed breather of fresh life. Found an interesting   article  by CVC (Chief Vigilance Commissioner ) on the same & also here is the   Chronology  of  Bofors events.
