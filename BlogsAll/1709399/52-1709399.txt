Brand Loyalty                            Most of us are Brand conscious . We buy a particular brand of Paste / washing powder / soap / TV regularly and are proud of it. Was thinking about it today and discussing it with my brother & came up with a list of my Brand favorites :    Toothpaste -- Colgate  -- For ages I have been buying Colgate . Can't think of having ever used another Brand.    Bath Soap -- Pears --  Though I have changed this brand occasionally , on the whole I seemed to have used Pears most often than others .    Washing Soap -- Rin  -- Never used any other Soap Bar than Rin.    Hand Wash -- Dettol  -- Its always been there beside my wash Basin.    Health Drink - Horlicks  -- Since I neither drink coffee nor Tea , Horlicks has been my favorite drink for years.I love that taste.    Music System -- Phillips  -- Had a Phillips system at Chennai , bought one in the US , Bought a Phillips TV at Chennai , Bought a Phillips Boombox at Delhi . I have been a very loyal fan of Phillips.    Shaving -- Gillette  - Once again both the Foam & Razor has always been Gillette .    Headache reliever -- Amrutanjan  -- Its always there in my Medical Kit .
