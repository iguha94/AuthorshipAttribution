A TALE OF TOO MANY CITIES - MUMBAI                                                The second in a Series of articles on Cities where I have lived (first one was on Madras) .I lived in Mumbai for two years . First one Year at Andheri and later one year at Ghatkopar.     LIKES :  I just Adore Mumbai. Its a city brimming with life & vitality and definitely one of my most favourite city . Its a Great city for working people with a professional Outlook and people in General are very nice & friendly in Mumbai. I love the Crowds & the Trains of mumbai . The trains are the lifeline & I used to wander all across Mumbai from Borivali to Andheri to Dadar to Chembur to Thane in those crowded trains. South Mumbai is spectacular with its beautiful seaface & Marine Drive. The Food in Mumbai is Great . From the Vadapaavs/ Bhelpuris / Paani Puris / Lassis to Magical South Indian joints in Matunga & Chembur , mumbai has it all. Whenever I see the ad of Citibank saying "The Citi Never Sleeps", I think of Mumbai.Great Infrastructure with 24 Hr Power Supply , No water/Road problem & perhaps the best public transport I have ever seen in the world.    DISLIKES :  Cost of Living , Exploding population , Big gap between Rich & poor .    PLACES TO SEE :  Gateway of India , Juhu & Chowpatty beaches , Mahalaxmi & Siddhivinayak temples , Queen's Necklace  , Elephanta Caves , Sanjay Gandhi National park ,  Crawford market , Powai lake.    Strengths :  Financial Capital of India , Gateway to the West , Home of Big Business houses , Professional Work Culture , Great Transport system , Wonderful amenities (power,water) management , Cosmopolitan Population , Natural Harbour , Biggest inflow & outflow of International Traffic , Entertainment Capital of India (Bollywood!!) .    Weaknesses :  High Real estate costs , Exploding population , More of an old-age than a new age city , Traffic Jam nightmares.    Oppurtunities :  Areas of Banking & Finance , Financial Outsourcing ( Investment Banking Analysis & research) by Wall street firms like Merrill Lynch , Lehmann Bros , Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan etc , Entertainment (Globalisation of Bollywood ) , Healthcare , Retail Trade , IT/ITES ( Has a few big names like Accenture, EDS but got to promote its English speaking population more) .     Threats :  Mafia & underworld , Poor State govt support & performance (The earlier Mumbai detaches itself from Maharashtra the better it is for the city ) , Need for quicker management of Roadways ( Flyovers to grapple traffic mess), New age Cities like Hyd,Blore attract chunk of FDI , High cost of Living.                                             Mckinsey & co has submitted a 32 page Report for Turning around Mumbai . If the Govt doesn't want Mumbai to become a Dead city I guess they need to take most things in that report seriously.  Bombay is Bombay anyday its the face of India.
