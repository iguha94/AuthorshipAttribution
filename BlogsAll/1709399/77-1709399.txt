Same Lyrics , Different Tunes                                                   Was listening to the Song "  Chupke Chupke Raat Din  " today morning , when it struck me the Same song had been sung by two different singers in two different tunes. The Jagjit singh's version is much more slower in his patented style but the song sounds wonderful by the Man who made it his signature - the inimitable Ghulam Ali .                                                   Also is the Ghazal "  Babul Mora  " sung by Jagjit and its famous cousin sung by the Idol of all - K.L.Saigal .                              In Tamil the songs which fit this genre are many and most of them are surprisingly Bharathiar songs . Be it "  Manathil Uruthi Vendum  " ( Sung by Yesudas in Sindhu Bhairavi & in the film by the same name ) .  "  Kaakai Sirakinile " - Beautiful composition by L.Vaidyanathan and sung by Yesudas in " Ezhavadhu Manithan" and composed by KVM in ' Thirumaal Perumai'. Other songs include " Nallathor Veenai Seidhu" , " Chinnanchiru Kiliye" & " Theertha Karayinile" .
