SARISKA - TIGER RESERVE                                                The onset of Winter in Delhi is the start of the Wildlife season in the north where Most Sanctuaries open post monsoons. We ( I , Aravinth & Durai) Decided to try Sariska Tiger Reserve located 200 Kms from Delhi near Alwar in Rajasthan. We started on a Saturday morning & inspite of the bad roads managed to reach Sariska by 11.30 am . Sariska Tiger Reserve lies 35 kms from Alwar . It is one the Project Tiger Reserves & has 35 tigers and 65 Leopards.                                                 We were lucky to spot a young Doctor couple who agreed to join us for the Open jeep Ride inside the Sanctuary . The Open Jeep ride lasted 3.5 Hours late in the afternoon and we spotted Plenty of Peacocks , Hanuman Langurs , Nilgais , Spotted Deers , Sambhars , Wild Boars in their Natural Habitat . We were also lucky to spot a mini chase sequence Between a couple of Jackals & Nilghais . I was extrememly luck to Spot a leaopard stealthily following a Nilghai . There was considerable excitement in the park after that but we never spotted the leopard in the open after that . We thoroughly enjoyed the Trip nevertheless spotting plenty of ungulates & peacocks all over the Sanctuary.  The Doctor couple decided to join us for the rest of the Journey and it was wonderful having them since they were great company.                                      We then headed to Talbraksha Sulphur springs which lie 20 Kms from Sariska. The place was extremely serene & pristine (There is not even electricity in this village) and the Sulphur springs were very hot emanating from the earth . There was some excitement there too when the Hanuman langur started yelling panic calls after spotting a leopard but once again our long wait didn't yield a leopard spotting. We made some bonfire , sang songs & had a nice Dinner (Maize & bajra rotis which were very tasty ) and went to sleep.                                      Next morning we got up early & took some good sunrise photos amidst flying pigeons and made a short trip to a closeby Jheel where we saw some Turtles & aquatic birds. We then took bath in the Hot Sulphur Springs in the Temple ( These springs are supposed to cure Skin ailments ) and then started for Silserh Lake.  The Silserh lake is located 15 Kms from Alwar & is spectacular. Its easily one of the biggest lakes I have seen set amidst the backdrop of the beautiful Aravalli mountains. We also visited a Place called Garhwaji , which is located 8 kms from Silserh & is a place far away from Tourists. It had a small waterfall & wonderful hill views . Boating was pleasant in the Silserh lake & we also had a rather expensive Lunch at the RTDC Hotel there . We came back to Alwar where we saw the Ruined fort. The alwar fort is completely in ruins , the only existing structure is the spawling Fortress wall.                                  The Palace is just closeby , but is maintained in a very poor state. The Tank of the palace sadly is inhabited by pigs now . The Palace I am sure would once have been a magnificent structure because it has a huge hall of public audience & wonderfully ornate carvings. We then went to the main market of Alwar where we bought some Milk sweets ( From Thakur Das sweet Shop in Hop Circus which is reputedly famous for this ) and then dropped the Doctor Couple at the Railway station and headed back to Delhi. We found a better road route this time via Daruweria & reached Delhi by around 10.30 pm.                                   The excitement of seeing wild animals in their Natural habitat is an immensely exciting & satisfying experience. The people of Rajasthan are one of the most Courteous & tourist friendly that I have ever seen.    TRAVEL TIPS  : The best time to Visit any Wildlife sanctuary is November - January & March - June. During the Summer the thirsty animals come to the waterholes and hence its easier to spot them ( But then Delhi during Summer is terribly hot too at 42-45 c ) . Make sure you book the Jeeps in Advance during the peak periods. Always carry a Binocular & a good camera . Observe utmost silence & keep your eyes trained to spot any movement. Most Sanctuaries have very good guides ( or in most cases the drivers themselves are good guides) & always take either an early morning trip or a late afternoon trip becase thatz when chances of spotting wildlife are high. But then at the end of all this , you have to be extremely lucky to spot a Tiger & hence pray to all your favourite gods before venturing out !!!
