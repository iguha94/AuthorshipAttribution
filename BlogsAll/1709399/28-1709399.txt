KASAULI                      My Uncle & Aunt have come down from Mumbai to Delhi and we went to Chandigarh & Kasauli this weekend. Since I have already written about Kurukshetra & Chandigarh earlier , I will not cover much about them. But every time I visit Chandigarh it seems to me the most beautiful city in India .                                      Kasauli is a quaint little town located 50 Kms from Chandigarh on the Chandigarh - Shimla Highway . Its a small town with pristine beauty far away from the madding crowd. We stayed at the HPTDC Hotel called Roscommon . It just takes a little more than 3 hours by walk to cover the entire town of Kasauli ( 5-6 kms) . According to Legend , when Hanuman was carrying the Sanjeevani hill from Himalayas to Lanka his foot touched a mountain peak here in Kasauli. There is a Hanuman temple built there ( ooff , its a steep climb !!) . The Mall road is littered with a few shops and offers some wonderful views of the monutains. Life is very quiet & peaceful in this litle town far away from the chaos of Delhi. The Kalka Mail at 23:45 is a good train by which one can return to Delhi early morning.                                      Kasauli is an ideal place for travellers who want to avoid the crowded Hill stations like Shimla or Mussorie.
