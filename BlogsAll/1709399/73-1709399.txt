Crystal Ball Gazing - The FORTUNE Way                                                                          This must be the icing on the cake. Its just not our Self-belief , now the Globe believes that this century belongs to India & China. The FORTUNE issued Dated 12th April , is a special edition on the Golden Jubilee of Fortune 500 Lists (The Lists commenced in 1954). An article part of that issue was a futuristic prediction by Peter Schwartz ( Former Royal Dutch/Shell Executive & Creative consultant to movies like Minority report) about the Top 10 Fortune companies in 2054 . Here are some vignettes from that article (I am just posting some excerpts which are of relevance) :   Top 10 Companies in 2054 :   1.  AmazonBay  (Formed by Merger of Amazon & e-bay ) :  the first 500 company to break $10 trillion in revenues. AmazonBay, the first and largest, came into being when Amazon and eBay merged in 2015, then bought Ask Jeeves a few months later. Over the next few years AmazonBay bought a bank, a credit card company, and an insurance company to increase the services it could offer.   2.  Indosoft  :  Computers woke up in 2043. But revolutionary change in the software business began years earlier as the U.S. giants began to be dominated by their Indian talent. Over time the network of global Indian clans moved their center of action from the U.S. to India. So in 2020, when Microsoft and Oracle merged, it just seemed natural to change the name to Indosoft and move the headquarters to the new Gatestown complex in Mumbai.     3.  Pattelco  :  Communication technologies and the companies that deliver them help shape their eras. The telephone (Bell), television (RCA), the Internet (Cisco), and mobile phones (Nokia) all defined their moments in time. In 2054 the technology that is redefining our lives is telepresence, and the key company is Pattelco.The Indian software giant, originally a software startup of the Patel clan, bought the remnants of AT&T in 2025 and incorporated the long-distance company's initials in its name when it launched the telepresence (TP) industry.                                                         There are only four companies from the current list that figure in the 2054 list and they are IBM,Toyota,News Corp & Nestle .
