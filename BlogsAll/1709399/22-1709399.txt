SULTANPUR BIRD SANCTUARY                                                                                    Its the start of the Delhi Winter which means that its one of the best time for Bird-Watching. Though its a little too early , 4 of us decided to catch up on some Bird Watching at Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary which is located 60 Kms from Delhi in Haryana.                                                              We started at 5.30 am from Noida and reached Sultanpur by 7 am. It was still chilly at 7 am and we were greeted by a Deserted parking lot at Sultanpur. The Sultanpur Jheel is a wonderful Bird Watching spot and the total walk around the Circumference of the Jheel is around 6.5 kms. We saw a lot of Birds like Cattle Egret ,painted Stork , King fishers , eagles, parakeets , Ibises , Spoonbills,Herons etc. I made some good use of my SLR camera . It took us around three hours to walk through the entire Circumference and it was a Pleasant walk thanks to the Weather and cheerful friends . There is also a small museum near the entrance which has some good photgraphs & description of the aquatic birds there.                                                 From there we headed to Sohna ( Its 25 kms from Gurgaon) , which is famous for its hot springs. We visited the Shiv Kund where hot water was springing from the ground and pilgrims take bath in the temple . The Hot spring water is supposed to be a curative , curing you of all your skin ailments. We then reached Gurgaon and spent a few hours in the malls. They were all Glitzy & the parking system there is very well organised reminding me of the ones I have seen in the US Airports.                                            We visited the Qutub Minar in the evening and took some nice snaps. Started by Quub-ud-din Aibak , it was completed by Iltumish later. Constructed 800 Years ago it still stands tall and is one of the most important landmarks of Delhi. The incomplete Alai-Minar is right next to it.                                                It was a nice one day outing & we were glad to have covered so many places in a day and returned by around 6 pm to Noida.
