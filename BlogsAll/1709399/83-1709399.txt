Indian Politico Speak                         The Netas have Hijacked the Media . Be it Print or Television you find them everywhere spewing out Jargons. We repeatedly keep hearing words like "Secular" , "Anti-incumbency" , " High Command" , " Political Swing" etc thrown at us. Here is a little humorous piece on what Politicians speak & what they mean :   1. Secular Front -- Whovever supports me is Secular and whoever opposes me is unsecular .   2. Anti-Incumbency -- An high profile word used to blame one's defeat due to non-performance.   3. High Command -- (Particularly in Congress) Means Sonia Gandhi. When a Congressman says the Congress High Command will make a decision he means he is awaiting Sonia's words .   4. Political Swing -- A Geographical phenomenon created by Bogus voting,Booth-capturing and bribing the voters .   5. Stability -- An agreement to be fooled for a long period of time between the Parties and the Voters.    6. India is Shining -- The Urban areas are full of BPO's,Malls fully lit even during night whereas Rural India is languishing in Dark.   7. We will Cross the Bridge when it comes -- We will indulge in Horse Trading after the results are announced.   8. Post Poll Alliance -- I am ready to fall at anyone's feet for power.   9. In the Nation's interest -- In my personal/party's interests .....  10. Jai Hind -- God save the Country
