Blogging Tips                                    The Second most searched word last year on Google was Blogging. I Started my Blog thanks to my friend  GBS  (  Chaotic Solitude ) . Four of my friends have since started blogs,after seeing my Blog. So what makes a good blog ? Here are a few Blog Tips which I culled from the internet :   1. Frequency, good writing, and personality - a mix of all those is critical.  2. Use correct grammar, no misspellings, and make sure all punctuation is in the right place.   3. Remember that whatever you publish will be found and archived by Google and other search engines and Web sites. So really think carefully about what you are putting out there before you do it.   4. Avoid today I did this posts, unless what you did was extraordinary.   5. Don't worry about who is reading, and just write about what is interesting to you.   6. Before you begin blogging, figure out your boundaries. Decide how much or how little you are comfortable with disclosing.  7. Don't try to please an audience, and don't post simply because you feel like you ought to . only post when you have something to say.   8. Photographs liven up a blog and, if they are good, can really be worth 1000 words.   9. Retain your sense of self and style - don't constantly emulate and copy those around you.  10. Last but not the least , Know your audience.
