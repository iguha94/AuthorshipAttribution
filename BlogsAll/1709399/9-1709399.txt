TELECOM TALES                                                     It was with incredible surprise that I read the TOI Article which claimed that Delhi now has more Mobile Phone users than Fixed line users . The Transformation in the Telecom Industry has been amazing in the last few years ( This is inspite of Muddle over ever Changing prices & TRAI Vs Operator Wars & CDMA Vs GSM Battles !!) . Telephone has always been Considered as a Luxury & STD/ ISD a bastion of the Rich & famous . But Today on my cell phone a Mobile to Mobile Long Distance  Call costs the same as a Local call , a drastic change from the 90's . In a Country like India with a Huge Population and a Burgeoning Middle Class its always the volumes which will tilt the Revenue equation in favour of the Operators than the premium. This is further corroborated by the fact that Mobile Phone is no longer a luxury but a Necessity & Call Volumes have increased multi-fold in the last few years.                                                      The Future looks exciting with the Govt recognising the potential of VoIP & the Country starving for more Bandwidth & Sophistication. So the cost of saying a sweet hello increasingly looks to be getting more inexpensive .........................
