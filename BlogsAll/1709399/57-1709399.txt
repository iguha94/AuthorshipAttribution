Khakee                     I saw the movie Khakee on Sunday. A very taut , action-paced screenplay with great visuals and some wonderful acting . AB,Ajay Devgan,Akshay Kumar in particular had acted very well. The first half just zooms past at an incredible speed and though the second half is typical hindi cinematic , it still not a bad movie. Rajkumar Santhoshi's Dialogues are very good. However , the songs are unwarranted and mar the pace of the movie.                          The movie somehow to me seemed very similar to L.A.Confidential (*ing Kevin Spacey,Russel Crowe). Apart from being a story of three cops, the other coincidence is the nature of their characters & a top official sending them on a wild goose chase.                       Hindi Cinema is caught in a transition these days. They want to improve but still want to satisfy the front benchers ( Item numbers ?) and end up satisfying neither . Mr.Santoshi , People would have liked the movie a lot more without those meaningful songs . The audience you are trying to satisfy do not come to such movies . So why such songs ?
