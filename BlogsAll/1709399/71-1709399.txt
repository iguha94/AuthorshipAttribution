Quality Control                              Quality is the mantra across boardrooms these days. ISO:9000/1, CMM Level 5, TQM,Deming,Six Sigma  etc are heard across the corridors of every organization as they strive to achieve Quality in all things .                                        If there is an Industry where Quality is the hallmark , then its the Food & Beverage Industry. Today one of my colleagues left the company and gave a Treat at Saravana Bhavan in Connought Place,Delhi.Well for all those uninitiated, Saravana Bhavan is as strong a Brand as Deming/Six Sigma when it comes to Quality. Though the Hotel Chain's owner got on the wrong side of the law , the food chain is still the ultimate food heaven for a madrasi. I am amazed at the way they maintain the Quality of their food. The reason why I am saying this is I have had saravana Bhavan food in Chennai,Delhi,Singapore & USA and all of them taste almost the same , which is no mean achievement.Quality doesn't just come only through Big five consultants & army of MBA's/engineers , Quality can be achieved even my modest people with the right intentions.
