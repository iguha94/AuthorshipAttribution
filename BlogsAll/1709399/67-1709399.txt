LAMP - Is it the future ?                                           Techies love Acronyms and here is one more to add. Was reading FORTUNE Mag which had an  article on the Open source movement and its growth. LAMP - Linux,Apache,MySQL,PHP(OS,Webserver,Database,PHP is used to write custom apps). These four are posing a considerable threat to Microsoft,Oracle,Sun & IBM . The Greatest thing about Open source is its constant innovation and ability to improve.They have also been responsible for the falling software prices thanks to their free/low fee models. To quote Mickos the founder of MySQL " Software has been overglorified for 20 years.you've been able to overcharge for underperforming software" .                             With Big players like IBM & Novell adopting a push towards the Linux movement and recent instances in Germany & India where Federal support for Linux has stunned Microsoft , we could assume that Linux has finally arrived. I interacted with Novell India yesterday and was surprised by their suite of products which includes a strong Suse Linux push (which they had acquired recently) . Fry's Electronics recently started selling low cost Linux PC's far as low as US$199 .                            LAMP might be beacon of light for low cost computing and in making PC's affordable to Billions of people across Asia & Africa.
