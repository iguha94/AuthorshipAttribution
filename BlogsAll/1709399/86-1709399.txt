Van Gogh - The Irony of a Genius                                 Read this harmless piece of news yesterday " Picasso's 1905 Masterpiece  Garcon a la pipe   set a new world record when it was auctioned for $104 million overtaking the previous record of Vincent Van Gogh whose Portrait of  Dr.Gachet  sold for $82.5 million a few years back " .                                                                I love reading Biographies & Autobiographies. One of the best biographies I have read has been the Biography of Vincent Van Gogh. Hailed today as one of the Greatest painters , his life was a tragic one. Here are some glimpses from his life :   1. With No one to support him except his Brother (towards the end of his life ) he was a loner most of his life.   2. Cuts off his ear in disgust after a Fallout with a fellow painter .   3. Gets admitted to a mental asylum since the locals consider him a madman.   4. Sold his only painting during his lifetime, for 400 francs.   5. Shoots himself , takes 2 days to die, alone in his little bedroom.  (at the age of 37)                                                               Could there be more irony than someone's painting selling for 82 million dollars when all he got during his lifetime was just 400 Francs ! Life is strange , ironical and sometimes cruel .
