Pulse Polio Day                                 In co-ordination with UNICEF & Rotary we took part in the Pulse polio drive today. We set-up booths at various sectors in Noida and administered the polio drops to the kids. At the end of the day we had administered Polio drops to around 1,250 kids (most of them from the Slums) . I was part of a Mobile Polio unit and drove all around Noida to most of the slums and administered the drops. We gave free pencils to all the kids which worked as magic. It served as a motivation for most of the kids to take the drops in the Slums. To think that more than 50% of those kids have never been to a school made me really sad. If Noida which is considered to be a affluent suburb of Delhi has 50% illiterate kids in slums then I shudder to think of Rural U.P & Bihar. There is so much that needs to be done at the grassroots level to spread the need for literacy.                                        Once again as the Chariman of the Social Services Committee at my workplace , I learnt a lot during this event. Right from co-ordinating with UNICEF,Rotary, Getting volunteers from our employees , managing these booths, Doing a write-up for our Intranet,Meeting with the Press etc etc...its been one roller-coaster of a management experienece. I also realized community service can be great fun apart from being emotionally satisfying . Gandhiji is perhaps right. India lives in its villages & Slums. If we can educate all these kids at the slums all around the country , we are the Superpower.God bless our country.
