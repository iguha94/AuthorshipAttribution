Okhla Bird Sanctuary                                        It all started yesterday evening during the Dinner. Was having dinner with a few friends at the office and then the conversation veered towards Wildlife/Bird-watching & Travel. A friend (Shouvik) of mine mentioned about the Okhla Bird Sanctuary situated right below the Delhi-Noida DND Flyover and we decided to explore it . I had heard of it through my BNHS (Bombay Natural History Society) newsgroups .                                       Today morning armed with Nikon Camera,Binocs we started at 5am for the Sanctuary. It was such a non-descript place with hardly any people . We had to search and travel across kutcha roads before finding a small board proclaiming " Welcome to Okhla Bird Sanctuary" . The sunrise was beautiful amidst the tall grasses and we spotted a lot of water birds like Cormorants,Partridges,White Herons,Ducks,Egrets. The Salim Ali's Book of Indian Birds was a great help in spotting the birds.We were the only two people there and spent more than two hours photographing & sighting birds.                                        Unfortunately the place is heavily polluted with Plastics & garbage. People travel all the way here and dump the garbage in the water which is very sad. Hope the Govt declares the place as a protected site and prohibits trespassers.
