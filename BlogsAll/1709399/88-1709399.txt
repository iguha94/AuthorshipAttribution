IITans                 Just finished reading the book " IITans" over the weekend . I was lucky to grab a copy autographed by Sandipan Deb ( The author of the book , Alumnus of IIT-Kgp,IIM-C) from a friend. The book talks about the incredible institution that IIT's are and discusses among other things how IIT's were formed,Successful IITans,The future for IIT's,The college culture (Midnight puri parties,ragging,inter-hostel rivalry),Absence of research and the Characteristics of IITans.                             Sandipan has a very light,lucid style of writing which makes an interesting read. The Book covers a wide canvass and the author has tried to do justice to them all . Though some familiar names like Vinod Khosla,Vinod Gupta,Rajat Gupta,Nandan Nilekani keep cropping up throughout the book the author does have some interesting obscure IITans profiled.                                  Most of us would have had IIT Dreams during our childhood and some of us never made it to those meccas of Techincal education . Probably there is a tinge of regret one might feel after reading this book , wishing one had put in a little more effort during those school days ( To have entered IIT ! ) . Its indeed a marvel that a nation which has millions of illiterate people has churned out the most brilliant minds in technology too .
