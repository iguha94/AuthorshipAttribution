Martyrs Day - Gandhiji                          Today is the martyrs day - the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. A man who stands as the epitome of Honesty & simplicity . He is definitely the most famous Global Indian and inspiration to millions of people worldwide for his policy of non-violence. He is also the most misunderstood soul inside India , where half-baked historians & politicians have blamed him for the Partition of India . In fact most of the youth of today have grown on this diet of misinformation . I remember reading his Autobiography "My experiements with Truth"a few years back. Its a great book because its a candid & brutal confessions of all his mistakes and it takes a great soul to accept one's shortcomings. Also my views on Gandhi very considerably influenced when I read "Freedom at Night by Lapierre & Collins".                          His message that India lives in its villages is the basis for Kalam's Vision 2020 and the Country realizes that Rural India means a lot to the nation as we strive to become the next superpower. My thoughts go to what Albert Einstein said about Gandhiji  "Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as [Gandhi] ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth."
