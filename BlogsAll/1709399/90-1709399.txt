John Lennon - Beatles                 Perhaps to most people the name conjures with a persona next to god (Is that why John Lennon infamously commented at the peak of Beatlemania in 1965 that " I think we (Beatles) are more popular than Jesus Christ " ? ). I was at the BCL (British Council Library , Chennai) and was fascinated by a Photo-book on Lennon which I promptly borrowed.The Book contains more than 500 Spectacular photographs of John Lennon & the Beatles ( All in B&W which makes it more appealing).The Photographs are Outstanding with texts inter-spread about John Lennon. There are some rare photos like the Beatles with Muhammad Ali (Cassius Clay then) proclaiming " We are the best" & Beatles upclose during their concerts & picnics.                  The book also traces the rise of Beatles,the ensuing mania,the dope culture,the break-up of Beatles,their quest for spirituality in India,John's controversial marriage to Yoko Ono,the long hair culture,his role as an ambassador of peace and his untimely death at the hands of a mad fan.                  John was shot dead when he was just 40 but his music & legacy continue to mesmerize the world.For all his controversies,we can't deny his importance either in the world of music or as a prominent figure of the 20th century.
