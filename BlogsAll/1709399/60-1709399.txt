Battle at a Different Terrain - Airtel Vs Hutch                                                They are the most fierce competitors in the GSM Arena. However , the battle off late has shifted to a different terrain Viz Advertising. I am not a GSM user and hence have no idea about their Quality of Service. However, Their Ads are awesome .                                                    The Hutch Ad is already the rage of the Nation . The Cute Boy & the dog which follows him everywhere with some great music has caught the fancy of the Nation. O&M Once again proves itself as one of the most Creative Ad agencies. The Sale of pugs (the dog used in the commercial) have skyrocketed .My personal favorite among the different versions is the one where he is seen writing the exam and the pug is seen cutely sitting beside.                                                   The Airtel Ad too has a nice Concept - Express Yourself. A picture can say a thousand words. The ads based on the entire gamut of Human emotions urges people to express them . The Visuals are good and the concept in itself is much more intellectual & stimulating. Rediffusion & DYR has done a great job.                                                    Hope both Airtel & Hutch improve their service to match up to the Quality of the Ads.
