Stupid Questions Techies can (will ) ask !                                           After having attended / conducted numerous technical trainings in my career , I am always fascinated by the repeated(Same old stupid) questions people ask during Tech Trainings .I am not sure if these are mandatory questions a techie should ask ( someone should publish such a book ! ) but makes for wonderful amusement. I have nothing against techies ( Technically speaking I am one too ) , but its just some humour at someone's expense . No offence meant to any person / company , living or dead :-)   FAQ by Techies (and the answers are by me :-) )   Q1. You told this application works on this port number by default . Can i change it ?  A1. No . You can't.God has pre-ordained that this application will work only on this port.How can you change God's rules ? (Hey every damn person knows that this can be changed. why the hell ask the Q ?)   Q2. Is this version 1.1.3.1 or 1.1.3.2 ?  A2 : This is actually version 1.1.3.1.But since it was feeling alone , they cloned the software and released its brother who is 1.1.3.2 .   Q3. What are the additional features when compared to the previous version ?  A3 : Give a long list of things most of which hardly work and the rest is hardly useful   Q4. I have worked with a similar application before which does the same things .  A4 : No . Its not possible. we obtained license from the God for the Intellectual property of this entire segment. Please tell us the company , we will sue them .   Q5. How stable is the application ?  A5. This application is the most stable & robust available in the market. In fact at one of our client's site which runs this application on a PC  , the application has been running continuously for the last 25 years , in fact even before the PC was invented !   Q6. Do I have to pay for the License ? Is there any Trial period available ?  A6 : Our endeavor is to make the world a better place. In fact we give money to you to run our application .
