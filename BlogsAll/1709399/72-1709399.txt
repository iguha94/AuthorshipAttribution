Fairchild Eight (Traitorous eight) !                                             The Boss isn't always right ( Ha , I am not trying to Dilbert you on this ! ) . I left my earlier job when I found that my new manager was impossible to work with .                                                        Great inventors not necessarily make great bosses. Was Reading the story of the Fairchild eight ( The Eight bright people who found Shockley - Inventor of Transistor , impossible to work with ) and left to found Fairchild Semiconductor.The eight men were Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Gene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and Sheldon Roberts ( At least three names ring a Bell - Gordon Moore,Robert Noyce,Gene Kleiner).                               Gordon Moore,Robert Noyce later co-founded Intel,Gene Kleiner founded one of the biggest VC firms (KPCB - Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers). The other 5 amongst themselves co-founded Teledyne,Xicor . Wow . What an achievement for a group which was referred to as traitorous eight !    Here is their Photo :    .
