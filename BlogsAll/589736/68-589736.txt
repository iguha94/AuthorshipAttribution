Okay, guys.  I know it's been a while, but I have been trying to catch up here and I just ran across Mir's comments about the Iraqis' looting situation and "we knew about the culture and history and all we protected was the Oil Ministry.  What does that say about us?"  It says we follow through on our word.  President Bush warned the Iraqi soldiers to not attempt to sabotage the oil reserves because it belonged to the Iraqi people not Saddam and his regime.  The revenues the oil can create would be neccessary for the Iraqis to rebuild their country.  This said, there was a plan in place to protect the Oil Ministry and the oil fields for the benefit of the Iraqis.    Alternately, there was not neccessarily a plan to protect other specific places, because who knew where the certain chaos that was to follow would erupt.  What were they supposed to do anyway, shoot the unarmed civilians?  That would have been all they could have done to stop it.  The crowds were enormous that were taking part in the looting.  The Liberals would have been screaming then that the innocent, unarmed looters had been shot!  Unfortunately, the looting happened, but it was bound to happen.  But, I'm sorry, protecting a museum was probably the last thing on the minds of the soldiers as they were watching there backs for remnants of the Republican Guard or the Fedayeen...
