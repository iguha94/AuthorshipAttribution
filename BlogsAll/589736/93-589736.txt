I thought Nick's post was clear and well stated.  As for my agreement regarding his take on the protest -- well, yes, I agree it was his take, since it was his protest, not mine, and those were his reasons.  They seemed valid grievances to me.  I don't really have a response to his suggestions, except they sounded like valid options for debate.  And yes, there certainly are many things that can be done now -- that was my point.  I was just wondering what others thought those should be, as most of what I hear in various media amounts to complaints rather than solutions.  As for handing Iraq over to the UN -- sounds to me like a swift Islamic Fundamentalist state in the making.  Which is what it wants to be, anyway.  All choices being equal, an uninformed populace will take the path of least resistance.  Either the UN's bureaucratic incompetence will set up a fast-track to that result, or the US will spend lots of money, resources, time, and lives on delaying it as long as possible.  The choice, in my layman's opinion, seems not in the destination, which appears predetermined to me, but rather in the journey that gets us there.  Note that I do not consider this fate permanent.  It is merely this generation's path of least resistance.  Revolutionary change takes generations to ripen.  Until then, a populace will suffer any inhumanity in exchange for bread on the shelves and trains that run on time.
