The anger within disturbs me far more than the anger without. - I feel that the notion of God making Man in His own image is one of the most egotistical and, ultimately, tragic inventions of our species. - I think we misname our Founding Fathers by not going back far enough.

In that sense, space exploration and colonization is the only available evolutionary path.  Everything else will forever be violent variations of existing themes. - Love is not what someone does for you, or what you do for someone; it is persistent and mindful engagement in another's spiritual growth. - I wish to be the citizen of a nation; not the subject of an empire. - Women have a right to be angry at the media's pervasive images, but I don't know what they can do to solve it.

This is why it is not foolish to open the refrigerator when  you need the microwave.  Both have doors and handles; you are acting on the premature matching of an incomplete pattern. - It seems everything I see is an advertisement. - Music is humanity's greatest artistic achievement. - I am grateful for cinnamon toast.
