As I posted a week or so ago, I am not a huge cat person.  That being said, when Julie and I started dating, she had a cat named Shadow.  It was very much a love me, love my cat situation.  Well, it took about half an hour.  Shadow was a very affectionate cat.  She would generally come when called.  She would even deign to play with us from time to time.  When she was about 14, she became listless and uninterested in eating.  I even tried tuna.  Previously, whenever we would even pop open a can of tuna, eShadow came flying in and loudly meowed and rubbed agains you to let you know what she wanted.  She was still uninterested.  She to stopped using the litter box.  We took her to the vet and she was diagnosed with renal failure.  The vet told us that one of her kidneys had atrophied, and the other was giving out.  We left her with him for 2 days to flush out her system with IV fluids.  For about a week after the treatment, she was fine.  We had switched her to a special kidney friendly food.  But, she eventually started sliding again.  I had the difficult task of coming home one afternoon to find her dead.  It was one of the most upsetting things that has happened in my life, even though I knew it was coming.  That one cat has made me open to the possibility of having cats in the future.  We have opted to wait until the children a older to introduce a kitten.  The bottom line is that I feel for you Mir.
