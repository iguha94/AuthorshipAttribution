My point is not that the Ten Commandments are old, but rather that they were traditionally authored by Yahweh, the god of the Hebrews in the Old Testament, and to refer to them as a starting point in our legal theory is to make inseperable our society's laws and the aforementioned deity.  Such a link would be quite alarming to citizens who do not worship that particular god.  Unlike many other countries, America is not a nation of culture, religion, or kin.  It is a land of immigrants, regardless of who got here first.  Any attempt to establish a connection to a single, unifying religious tradition immediately excludes hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others, and immediately weakens what I consider one of my country's strengths.  The history of human thought is rich and vast, and is more than capable of providing all the justification necessary to hold a society, or a nation, together.  I see no need to choose one artifact from one religion to serve as a back-up for already existing laws.  It is every family's right to display that artifact -- any artifact -- in its own home, or, alternatively, in any private gathering place.  Such an artifact can inspire as much or as little thought or dialogue as the private individual sees fit.  But to place it in a government courthouse suggests, to me, that our laws and the god of the Old Testament are inexorably connected.  And I just can't find a compelling historical, philosophical, or, for that matter, religious reason that it must be so.  Note:  My argument is focusing on the suggested *connection*; I do not feel the judge in question was directly prohibiting the exercise of any particular religion.  Though I doubt he'd mind very much.
