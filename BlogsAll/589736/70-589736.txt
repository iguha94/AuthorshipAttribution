my cat, sam, who i have had for 12 years, was diagnosed today with renal failure, and i will have to put him to sleep tomorrow.  i cannot express how horrible this is and how painful it is to not only to see him suffer, but to be the one who has to decide that it is time for him to die.   i could let him survive for a few more weeks, but he would just be in pain - it would not be the way he would want to live his life.  he was always a very strong and intelligent cat. now he is basically unable to walk more than 5 steps, unable to use the litter box, (he was, before this, a very fastidious animal), covered in his own drool and urine.  i have tried to brush him and to clean him, but he does not seem to know what it's going on. i don't know if he knows me but he still does respond to his name.  i want to believe he knows me - i want him to know that i tried to save him.   but i couldn't and i feel guilty but i know, logically, that i cannot save him. i have held him, rocked him, placed his almost limp body on the bed next to me, my head against his, and i don't know whether to pray for a quick death in his sleep so i don't have to euthanize him tomorrow - so he won't know what has happened.  i have cried so much today and i know in the next few weeks that it will happen again and again.  i love him - i love him as much as someone can love a cat.  and it hurts, damnit.  it hurts so much.  btw, i just wanted to express this - don't feel it would be rude to post a political or satirical or silly comment after this. i know life goes on - i just wanted to get it out.
