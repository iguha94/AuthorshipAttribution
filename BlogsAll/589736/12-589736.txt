the whole thing was a dupe, engineered by palpatine/sideous to take control of the republic, with a now tried-and-true army to back up said control.  jango was working for dooku/tyrannus, dooku/tyrannus was working for palpatine/sideous.  dooku had orders to let the whole thing unfold roughly the way it did - give the republic an enemy to fight, and then step in to fight it, proving to your constituents that they need you to protect them.  classic empire building - divide and conquer, from within.  i had indeed thought of the seperatist / rebellion connection - i think they're one and the same.  anyone in the republic who had any sympathy for the seperatists will have to accept the fact that they almost wiped out the jedi council under dooku's direction.  many will side with palpatine as a result, and support his use of the clone army to make them pay for what they did.  the separatists will slowly become the rebellion that we're familiar with in episode 4 as the roots of the deception become clear.  for now, dooku will continue to serve as the lead "boogey man" for the jedi and republican troops to focus on, while the real threat slowly arises behind them, as palpatine gains political power.  eventually, dooku will be exposed and/or killed, leaving the seperatists in chaos.  meanwhile, the peaceful republic will continue to transform into the empire, as the noble jedi knights are swept away to make room for the soulless cloned soldiers.  episode 3 should be quite the laugh riot.
