Black was probably a respect for the war/soldiers thing, I'm thinking.  Halle Berry's dress was a bit unflattering...and it's hard to NOT flatter that body.  I kind of liked J Lo's sea-foam mumu.  It was very 70's and fun to me.  I liked that Nicole Kidman and Susan Sarandon had dresses with similar necklines...it was so faux pas, and it made me laugh to think that they might have seen each other and said, "Shit!" when they got there.    Yes, I'm breaking up with Johnathan and moving to wherever it is that Adrian Brody lives, a location unknown to me, as I have never actually met him and I am totally kidding.  That's just sort of the Angie way of saying that I really like him.  Kind of like how Liv Tyler and Angelina Jolie are my girlfriends.    Oh, and by the way, I've decided that I did not like the color that Julia Roberts had dyed her hair.  It didn't do anything for her skin tone.  And Kate Hudson's hair, skin and dress were all the same color...she looked like a walking tan with lips.  It was a little strange.  I thought Diane Lane looked fabulous though.  And I think Catherine Zeta-Jones is just so cute when she's pregnant.  The only acting I've ever seen her do that I really liked was "Zorro" and "Traffic," so I'm not like a huge fan or anything, but she makes a darn tootin' cute lil pregnant lady.    I worry that Julianne Moore will suffer from Meryl Streep Syndrome and be nominated a jillion times and not win (although Meryl did win two, but that was 20+ years ago, and she's been nominated MANY more times since).  I really hope she gets one someday, because she's just really first-rate.  This was going to be a short post that turned into a long ramble because I'm avoiding doing my task at work, i.e., labeling and taping brochure mail-outs.  Blah.  Save me.
