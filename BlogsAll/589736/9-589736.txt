welcome, chummers, to the new and improved   circle of irony  .    join us as we blather on with a sense of relevence and self-importance about an endless array of topics:  politics... science... religion... politics again... yes, this is hard electronic proof that i (and now you, apparently) have one or more of the following:   1.  no life 2   too much idle time 3.  a job with a computer (those fools think you're working - you'll show *them*!) 4.  an idiot in your life named ben   sooo, with those qualifiers out of the way, let the posturing and mindless chatter commence!  this way, there's no need for us to clog our inboxes with meandering discussion threads - and if you no likey the thread, you can simply not visit the site for a few days.  it's beautiful, man...  now get posting!  if you've replied to the "blogger invite" that i sent, you should be able to post by now to the special "publishing" site.  the page that you add posts to (or "publish", as blogger describes it) gives you an entry screen at the top.  once you've "published" whatever bit of wry writ you've come up with, you can then go to  http://yelahneb.blogspot.com  to check it out by clicking on the "view web page" link.  in other words, the site you enter your rant on isn't the same site for viewing everyone else's. if you have any questions, give me a holler.  if this seems like more trouble than it's worth, go back to sleep.
