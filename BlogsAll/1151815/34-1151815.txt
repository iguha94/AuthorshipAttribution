         Eaton Centre - Northern Wing(#579RJ)       Upon entering Eaton Center you are struck numb by the awesome size of the  place. Bright light shines from the glass domed ceiling, casting dazzling  reflections off the tiled floor. It is four stories of commerce, complete with  the dominant mall subculture, White Trash. You can't turn your head without  seeing kid leashes, mile high bangs (you estimate that the hairspray it would  take to make hair defy gravity like that would create a substantial hole in  the ozone layer), and prepubescent boys and girls waiting to be picked up by  their mothers.      A rent-a-cop sleeps on a chair directly next to the information booth  where an old lady reads a copy of the latest Danielle Steele romance novel,  looking anything but helpful. Directly behind that is an island of payphones,  all with gummed receivers and bathroom poetry etched on the plastic surfaces.      Many stores bespeckle the mall landscape, but all are under the  impressive wing of Eaton's department store. Eaton's stands as a direct  contrast to your first impression of the mall. The patrons are all well  dressed, the sales people amiable, and the wares are exquisite.                               This is a DAYZONE                               It's midmorning, and the Centre is /packed/ with last minute holiday shoppers. Poor husbands too busy normally to do any shopping, are now zipping around trying to find the 'perfect' gift for tomorrow morning. There are some frantic women, and teens and people of all ages. Politeness and courtesy, have melted away because of the last minute hysteria. Ah ... the holidays.  Penny wouldn't normally be in a mall but she's a woman on a Mission (from God, totally another story). She's one of those people that hates the holidays but loves the presents and has come to this nexus of Hell & Beyond prepared. In one hand is a list and the other a fist (pocketed of course). She walks with purpose through the burgeoning crowds and carries a look that moves gravity as  a force away from her. She's here to shop, don't mess with her.  That seems to be the attitude a lot of people have. There is a tension in the air, that seems only aggrivated by the stupid piped musical version of 'White Christmas' that is sung, poorly, by the Toronto City Chorus. Or maybe it's just the recording that sucks. And yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. His fat ass is sitting right over there, with a line of kids two miles long waiting for the $25 a pop opportunity to sit on his sore lap and beg for presents. Some are lucky enough to be able to afford the photograph too.  Penny's got skills. And the advantage of looking like she'll punch people in the mouth for that tie or those cufflinks. In one of the normally tastefully appointed men's stores she's elbowed her way into, the holiday-temps have festooned the mannequins with santa hats, pierced the suits with ornament-hooks and lined the walls with blinking lights. This wouldn't be a problem but for the simple fact that the lights have started to strobe and blink out of sync with the timer - and it's started to look more like the inside of a club than the local version of Brooks Brothers.  There is constant background noise as well, of registers, ringing in purchases, spitting out receipts, the dialing of credit card machines ... ah ... you have to love capitalism. Some of the stores have gone above and beyond, and are circulating, giving out free sweets of sorts, but mainly, most are just too busy. Shelves are left unstocked, and the cases containing the merchandise sit nearby, since the help is just too busy to unpack it. That doesn't stop customers from helping themselves to the materials inside however.  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" at diff 5          For a total of 2 success(es).  //.etro: Penny rolls "dex" at diff 5          For a botch!  Boxes and boxes. And so many people. Penny starts perusing quietly and with limited movement. Any casual observer would say she's a little stiff and tense, even for a last-minute shopper. A clerk with a straightrazor comes around toward a mess of sweaters and oxfords half-ripped out of the cardboard and she stands aside with a woman clearly harried and ready to get out of the stores already. Penny's hand moves to the small of the woman's back and gets tangled in the cord of her purse when they get shoved by another group of rabid customers.  About thirty seconds later Penny goes "..shit" under her breath and tugs her hand away, gets more stuck and hey, isn't this awkward.  The woman who's purse your hand is caught in turns around, and yanks on her purse, hard, "ExCUSE me," she says, loudly. Loud enough for the clerk to hear. And you know, most stores these days have electronic survalliance. How much do you want to bet, security saw your bangled up attempt too?  All at once and without pausing, she hunches her shoulder inward and gasps "Oh my god, I think he cut me" and looks at the woman with wide, frightened eyes. Look over there? The clerk with the box cutter looks terrified and confused. Her posture screams 'lawsuit' and he immediately positions himself with the straightrazor in the Other Hand, trying to nonchalantly go back to his job. But there's so many people, like so many trapped animals circling and diving for the kill. "Help," quietly to anyone. It's building, this hysteria.  Christmas eve, the perfect time to get all those last minute presents. Or, in some cases, all those presents. Snow glinting on his furry coverings, the unlikely christmasophile saunters happily into the shopping center, rosy cheeks and serene smile in hand. Sidestepping casually he avoids being bowled over by happy happy children, screaming at each other in their endless joy. Reaching into a pocket, he draws out a handfull of change to drop into the carol singers basket while he scans the shops for likely candidates.  Follow the strobing lights and the generalized distraction and you'll find Penny. Maybe. The locals are getting hostile, jabbing items with senso-tags at security guards; waving receipts like white flags in front of them "I paid for this! I paid!" Little children screaming and crying because that's what little children do. Mothers and fathers with more bags of wrapping paper than actual gifts, with boxes, with ribbons and bows. Colors block out the patterns of the mood swing - gargantuan red bows there signal overwhelming feelings of helpless frustration, flashing gold lights in their centers. Gigantic wreaths and streamers of green keep the consumers moving into the stores and buying buying buying. Green goes in, green comes out.  There is chaos, and there is the furry island of calm, standing next to singers who gradually become more and more distraught as their small fence barrier is jostled. Flicking in and out of tune. Pobble begins to drift through the crowds, patient and zen. He stops, waits for openings and slips forward. Eyes scan for the least populated shops. Even masters have their limits on patience. He chuckles at something, shaking his head with a last glance towards the singers before they're lost in the heaving sea of frantic proles. He makes his way towards a flight of stairs, and stops next to it in a  small lull in the shifting tides. Reaching into a pocket, he pulls out a bright blue flip phone and idly taps in a number. Days like these, one needs a shopping partner. Or a mainline injection of coffee. Of all the shopping malls in all the cities, Pobble had to pick this one to walk into. There's madness here; a fever pitch brought on hour-to-hour and minute-to-minute. Walking, talking holiday memes: Santa Claus is coming to town - anticipation, he knows when you're awake - paranoia, jingle bells - cashier noises. You Must Buy. Spend money, appease the seasonal gods. Spend money, everyone will thank you. Spend money, there's love for sale.  Penny is carefully extracting herself from a difficult situation down the doomed corridor. Burdened with bags, the flashing christmas lights in the men's store have become too much holiday for her. Doubled over, she sinks to the marble floor outside and pokes around her tied-on bag to make the ringtone stop. "What, I'm losing the fight. Oh god it's awful," she says into the phone.  "Most unlike you dear." states Senior Pobble into his phone. Nearby someone blurts out, "A blue phone! Where'd you get it. I want it. Hey, this guy has a blue phone."   At first ignoring the lanky shrill toned man, Pobble interjects as the creature-of-impulse reaches for his phone. Pobble puts a hand out, and pushes his bloody palm towards the monster. The sight of the wounded and oozing hand coming for his face is too much for the shattered mind of the last minute shopper, and the man looks about frantically while backing off. A new thing takes him, clutching at straws and he begins crying out again, "A coat, that man has a green coat! Hey, look!" and he runs off, to paw at random man's old green coat. A must have this christmas. "Why are you so calm," Penny stays seated underfoot and out of sight with the phone pressed to her ear "Did someone just try to rip you off?" She sniffs and there's a rustle of paper-and-plastic bags "Everyone here's going crazy. I think I just got slashed" says this thing casually "I don't wanna look."  "You're here?"  In the background are the sounds of the Salvation Army Band. A group of four players and one nun with a bell. It's unending noise jangles nerves and keeps everyone far away, not tossing coins into the metal bucket. Find them and you'll find her.  "Of course." Pobble smirks, "God wishes he could be everywhere else but here. I think he's starting to forgive you." His voice is calm, controlled and continuing the pattern of the past week. The sounds of the chaos through the reciever attest to the fact that yes, he is in the same hell as you. "I'm at the bottom of some big stairs." Turning slowly, he looks about for a better landmark. "Think you can make it to the information booth?" That sounds like a plan, everyone is too busy to ask for information. Information erodes shopping time. Everyone knows that if they stop to ask for direction, the bargain that had their name on it will be bagged and taken.  "I can't. Go left and you'll see a dancing banana," a landmark if ever there was one. "I'm afraid."  Penny seems to not have moved an inch since putting the phone to her ear. People are walking around her now in and out of the store with the strobing lights.  "There's a guy in a bearsuit, fu.. Pobs?"   Pobble stops and twirls gracefully. Spotting said Bananna he smiles beautifically. "I see.. I'm not far away." Waiting for a space, in a manner not unlike a game of Frogger, he moves towards the victim. "Never fear, Dr. Steve is here."  Surely enough, he isn't far away. The connection goes dead, phone slipped back into pocket, and the furry chemist eclipses the strobes over the prone woman as he crouches down behind you and puts an arm over your shoulder.  Whispering into your ear he says quietly, "Be not afraid." A slight smear of blood graces the purple leather where his hand sets down before it moves, so that his fingers touch your cheek. Another hand reaches into his pocket once more.  But Pobble your hands,..." she cautions and fails to mention what big eyes he has (the better to see you with), what strange things in his hair (the better to hear you) and those things marks, those marks on his forehead (and never you mind about that). This is something that no shopper wants any part of, that no shopper wants to see. Perhaps they confused the color combinations - that red wasn't on her coat, it was on the wall behind her. It was in a poster, an advert on the wall. It wasn't in his hands. Penny must've mis-spoken, she must've seen wrong. She must be on drugs.  The hand emerges from pocket, holding something. What it is, lost in the shadows and blocked perspectives to any that would be watching the couple out of sight huddling at foot level.   "Shh.. You trust me right Pens?" he says looking into the woman's eyes with that zen smile. The hand fidgets at Penny's side, before gently pulling up her top just a minute ammount. Shielded in the crevase between them, and still with his fingers touching her face, Pobble eases a syringe into Penny's side. Silver serum out, syringe vanishes.   The chemist closes his eyes for a second, twitching almost imperceptibly before leaning in further to kiss Penny's forehead. "Happy christmas."  Penny looks upward past the Judas kiss; consider the ecstatic having a visions, collapsed then into a fit. The woman weeps; she must be crazy. The cellphone tumbles from her hand and gets kicked away by a thousand pairs of feet. A child notices but so, too, does his mother and tugs him away from them; from the trouble she knows them to be. The little boy still reaches for the phone, its color and size toy-like and attractive. A lost cause.  The security guard that was looking for Penny might find her now, bleeding from the side as she'd suspected when she slipped past him. Her blood moves quickly and spreads across the tiles.  The serenity has cracked on the furry man, and with a weary face he moves to stand, attempting to bring Penny up as he does so. A tear runs down his face as he begins the ardurous task of leading Penny towards the exits and out of (in to?) hell. He moves slower, his expression a Frappe of sorrow and a McFlurry of wearyness. Opening his coat he wraps it around Penny, big enough as it is. Glancing to her as he waits for an opening, he smiles. A very old, very tired smile. There are no words. Just a break in movement before they continue on out. The phone lost in the forest of feet, and the blood just another pitfall in the Temple of Doom, waiting for an unwary hurried automaton to come crashing down on its slick surface.
