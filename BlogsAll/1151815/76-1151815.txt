         You turn up the side street, as the businesses gather together; just past a dry cleaning store and just before a four-story apartment building, the courtyard opens up and you step in.  Tourist District - Courtyard of Shrines          This small courtyard is perhaps twenty feet by thirty feet, open to the street on one side and blocked by buildings on the other three. A dry cleaner is on the first floor of one building, but its upper stories and the other two buildings appear to be residential. The one that forms the back of the courtyard even has small balconies on the upper two stories, and first-floor windows peering right into the courtyard. Near the street are two stone benches, freestanding, and a discreet stone-exterior trash can.         The courtyard itself is mostly paved in cobblestone-style, the stones a diverse lot of shapes, but set well and pleasing enough to look at. Between the paths and the wide central areas are a few flower beds with flowers or even small bushes, and set against the walls along the courtyard are a variety of shrines, all constructed to survive the weather since they will be exposed to it. Here is a stone Buddha statue, and there a figure of Kwan Yin; each shrine occupies a small area, leaving space for the diversity of its neighbors, though they are spaced so that it is possible to face any one without facing its neighbors, at least if you are close.  Contents: Cash Rai Obvious exits: Out    Rai sits cross-legged in front of a statue of the Indian God Hanuman, and nearby Cash leans against a statue of Buddha. The boy gives the older man a disappointed look, though gets distracted by the sparklers in the statue's stomach going out. "Perhaps placing them in the rain was not wise," he opines quietly.  "Well... shit. Yeah, thanks for that. Nobody likes.. a smart asss... fuckin'... smart ass." Take that Asian youth, Cash stands open arrived before the fat man's statue looking into the rain with scrunched features.   To his left, the sogging remains of what once was an offering straight from T.J. "Nobody makes sparklers like Mexicans. They use dog shit ya know."  Under the hood of a large, dark golf umbrella are a pair of long, skinny legs swishing open the sash of a wrapped raincoat. Moving fast through the courtyard, she's sure-footed - clearly a she - the umbrella hefted by the wind. This way. That way. Can see her face. She touches the bronze of a statue, an absent gesture of balance coming up slow behind Cash. He'll notice the shade and she'll say "De nada" quietly then if it's possible to take that down a notch "Supposed to make ourselves scarce til Piggy gets the gr-" Penny looks at the boy "dogs settled in."  Rai blinks slowly at Cash, and doesn't look like he's quite sure how to respond to that. An uncertain, "Oh," is the eventual reply. "Does that burn well?" He looks about to add something else, but promptly goes quiet as Penny comes into his field of vision, looking at her curiously.          This young Chinese boy stands at four foot two, a little under average for his age, and whipcord thin. A strong breeze probably wouldn't blow him over though, there's sinewy muscle there, but it's a highly athletic figure with no excess muscle or fat on him at all. Even as the slimmer average builds of Asians tend to be, this boy is exceptionally lean, lending him an almost starved look. His features are typical of his race, hair so dark a brown it may as well be called black and slanted brown eyes in a flat face. Though not much of a looker, he really does exude a hefty amount of 'cute' in that way kids often do, despite - or perhaps because of - his usually quiet, withdrawn manner.          His clothing shows that he likely comes from a poor household. Baggy, worn black cargo pants that look like they belong on a kid a year or two older than him, dirty old black sneakers and a dark gray zip-up hoodie that's also starting to look worn. He's usually got that layer of general dirt and grime on him that children accumulate, as well as frequently sporting the various bumps, bruises and scrapes of an active kid. When he talks, though his pronunciation is clear, he has a heavy Hong Kong accent that marks him as foreign-born.  "Where are we... again?" The question for miss come lately. Cash shakes his head, nose squinting to match his eyes. "I dunno where the hell we got off." He wields no protection from the rains, his hair smelling like a wet sofa as it soaks in. The answer's not waited upon; Cash gestures back towards Rai with his nightly liquor thermos. "Thasss... Wha' was yer name again? Said it's bedder I dunno." Penny tilts the umbrella into the rain, the noise and bounce echoing in a way that makes Cash a little bit hard to hear. Or did she do that on purpose? She spins it again, repositioning herself to Cash's right, "You know," a look on her face - ponderous "I have no idea. Eva just gets these," picking fallen leaves off her coat, irritated - taking the weather personally "ideas. She get's these great big ideas and runs with them and never tells us anything. She's probably still pissed off at us. Did you see any signs?"  Rai offers Cash a small, almost patronizing smile at the question, but apparently takes Penny's replying to the man as an excuse not to actually respond himself. He reaches up long enough to slick his wet hair back out of his face, but otherwise continues to watch the two of you quietly and as unobtrusively as one can when sitting, well, right there.  "Well, wha' whas' the... thee, uhhh." Cash's thoughts get lost in the rain for some time, though he's sure to cover the neck of his bottle to guard against contaminant. "Fuggit." He waves it off and lifts his haggard form the wet fat man. "I dunno. I don' care. But... I kinda want some chicken. This rain sucks azz...anywayzz." Back into the pouring weather, he peers up a single eye.  The road weary marks of foot traffic have left their stains on this man. An aura of abandonment radiates in a ten foot circle around Cash. It is perhaps the strongest sensational quality about him. His unkempt hair and attire enforce this visage. The man himself stands no more than five foot seven, and that's generous. But a wide little bugger he proves to be. Shoulders set squarely apart from one another. And arms decently adorned with a squat brutish quality. Though his modest beer gut says this isn't a formed build. It's probably genetic. Cash's eyes are usually obscured by wavy dark locks; he's been growing that mop for at least a year or so. In no particular style, really. One day he just stopped going to Super Cuts and it grew with an alien will all its own. Muddy brown eyes peek out occasionally from below the curtain of hair that falls barely below them. This man's a Caucasian, that's obvious. Probably in his late twenties. He's got a large nose to, most probably Jewish or Italian in origin. There's bowed lips below that and a cleft chin. Cash is sporting a good three or four days worth of facial hair, with badly groomed 'burns reaching down ether side of his jaw line sharply.           His clothes are a tad low end. It's typically referred to as a 'Puerto-Rican' suit. Really though, it's just a lot of denim. Faded blue jeans frayed at the cuffs, and a spiked rocker belt with a metal buckle. It's inscribed with flowing letters that read 'Grandpa'. He walks on Chuck Tailors, a pair that've seen better days. They were probably 'white' at some point. Though now they're more of a dingy off-white, showing off black socks through the holes in their heels. To complete the suit he wears a denim jacket. Beneath it, there's a white T-shirt with a picture of Alice Cooper's face. A small golden Star of David about in his neck dangles from a modestly thin necklace. The last notable detail pertaining to Cash, a smell associated with whiskey if you happen to be downwind.   Penny mutters to Cash, "... so... saw... place?... artery-hardening slop... in... then as an aside, lower... we in Michigan?... I... I knew.." she links arms with Cash - her's across his back and vice versa - "..used to know... guy... Nods.... a... you... there's... seven... jails... like... go... Says something,... it." Penny looks over her shoulder at Rai... friend?"" You whisper ""Wait so you saw a chicken place? I seriously doubt it's that artery-hardening slop you found back in Michigan," then as an aside, lower "..are we in Michigan? Fuck I wish I knew.." she links arms with Cash - her's across his back and vice versa - "..used to know this guy Frankee Nods. Heard he did a stretch and a half up around there. Did you know there's eighty seven county jails in Michigan? It's like they expect half the population to go bad. Says something, doesn't it." Penny looks over her shoulder at Rai "Who's yer friend?"" to Cash.  Rai shifts his feet under him, standing up and giving himself a small shake to lose the excess water. Rather ambitious, since more just falls on him again. The two of you are presented with a small bob that's a bit much for a nod, but not quite enough to be a bow, and then he turns and takes off quickly towards the street without another look back.  "Yeah." Cash nods, ducking for a slight reprieve from the rain. "No." Then immediately he denies it. "I dunno who tha' kid is." The bottle that's helping him make a mess of himself, is nudged into Penny's chest for her benefit. She could use some dirt. "Weird though. Lil'... weird lil' freaky monkey boy." The pitch of his voice is raised so he may shout a departing word over the downfall. "Later... man...."  Cash waves.  Penny finally catches on, trades Cash the umbrella for the bottle "Fuck me, what day is it? Tuesday already?" Penny swigs and immediately gets confused "When is it? I need a watch or something. Something Eva won't like enough to steal. I always thought those cushions had no seams, but there's a lot of loose change," sloshing through puddles, she waves to Rai too.  "A lot of loose change."  There's no response from Rai, he doesn't even look back, and is soon out of view as he leaves the courtyard and hangs a sharp left. Rai leaves the courtyard, heading back down the street and out of sight. Rai has left.  "Drink tha' 'n less get outta here. I don't wanna get all dunked by Bhudda. I'm all... farblondzhet." The exchange is forced again, Cash takes the whiskey bottle back for a damp jacket and starts down the path.   Each collar propped like the Fonz, he'll cool it all the way down to the little people. "I cou' /really/ use some chicken though. We gotta get some kinda airline food up in her or somethin'. Maybe... a... a lil' thing a' peanuts. Salted, ya know."  "Salt peanuts? With Eva?" Penny keeps walking, but unevenly - as strangely poised as her words "Not unless you get fat, turn black and start playing the trumpet." She swipes at the corner of her mouth, phantom alcohol and the damp making her fingers twitch.  That's it for a while from her. She's entering her s.o.p. for new places - easy to catch once you know what to look for - a long walk, loaded to the gills, for as far as she can go until the roads divide the landscape into well-groomed and doomed.  "Find me somewhere quiet - I need to," trails off.
