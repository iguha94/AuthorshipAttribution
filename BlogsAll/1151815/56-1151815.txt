         [Ed. note: Penny plays pool. Really well. Impresses locals and makes a new friend.]  Pandora's Box - Pool Hall       The ceiling is set high with churning metal fans. The blades churn a thick haze of smoke from cheap cigars and the pungent aroma of sweat mixed with stale spilt beer. The bar runs the length of the far wall much like a saloon in an old western. A polished brass foot-rail gleams in the fading light of the occasional dropped match and guttering cigarette butt.       Many of the patrons watch each other with looks of a cautious calculation. Not only are those opposite the pool table viewed with suspicion, but also the few one might mistake as a friend. A darkness of nefarious deed reigns within the shadows as the lighting illuminates from the mouth down. It is as though the dark conspires to hide the intent deep within the eyes from the light of revelation. Then again the windows to these souls only come up black.

Contents: Pool Table Chuck Obvious exits:  Devros moves past the usual drunkards, taking a quick stop by the bar and casting a glance over Chuck. "The usual, Chuckie.." He doesn't bother taking a seat, merely leaning his back against the counter and settling his gaze on the 'crowd', checking for familiar faces.  There's a table toward the back that's been left in mid-play, cues crossed over the felt as clear indicators. One of the two players is off in the corner counting out singles and the other, Penny, is just lighting up returning from a bathroom break. Taking a 'fuck it, I'll stay' approach to the game, she unties the sash of the trench she wears and throws it at high stool where it lands, crumpled.  "Oi," beckoning with two fingers to the shark counting out, she takes a drag and fingers down a stick "s'finish, hey?"  The guy's amused. He thinks she's funny. "Yeah a'right sweetheart, double or nothin'?" It's obvious he's winning. Five stripes, one solid left. And the eitghtball.  Devros soon takes his eyes from the ranting beggar in the corner, his gaze drifting to the pool table, an exciting spot to peep at, as always. The bartender returns a few moments later, handing Dev a bottle of beer. "Thanks. Put that to my tab..", he calls, coming a few steps closer to the table, not making the fact he's overhearing the chat very subtle.  Winning but not confident or comfortable in the least, his bravado lacks sincerity. This guy - let's call him Greg, Greg has a look about him, like he's out of his element. He gives any casual spectator the impression, given the sweat beading on his upper lip and forehead, that he's about to lose a great deal of money.  The chalkboard behind them shows Penny as three up on him.  "C'mon, it's your shot" she leans back to a post, tall enough that the shadows linger from the nose down, her smoke curling ever upwards, the cut of her smile terrible.  You don't really have to be much of a skilled pool player to realize the guy will have a hard time topping his opponent and getting the jackpot. Devros takes another step forward, slipping a gloved hand down the side of his trench and pulling a pack of cigarettes. As if the bar weren't foggy enough. He watches the rest of the game intently, glancing between Greg and Penny.  Making a fist of his left hand, Greg knuckles down to the felt. Somewhere under the din of voices at the bar there's music. His brow wrinkles but it's clear he can't concentrate, not with Penny watching so smug. There she is, breathing easy. Isn't she? He looked away for a second and she vanished but the door to the back hallway's still swinging shut so he picks up and rests heavily on the cue, asiding to someone sympathetic "That's like the hun'eth time she done that, yeah?" "Yeah. Fucken girls man." "Whadaya think's up with that?" "No idea man, don't ask tho' ..chicks hate it when you ask."  It was only five minutes, maybe six that Penny was gone and as she comes back, her hand's smoothing down the right side of her shirt, tugging at it. Picking out a stripe from the left corner pocket, she rolls it back out to the table - some weird house rule, maybe? But it does explain a lot.  Smoked down to the filter already, she goes "So?" laying down a coin on the edge "let's go."  Ready for it, Greg hunkers down to the tableside again, lines up behind the big white ball and scratches.  Devros pulls a cigarette, replacing the pack for his white lighter. His gaze only leaves the table to follow Penny on her way to the bathroom, and then back to Greg. He curls his lips into a thin smile, shaking his head at the poor guy, aware of his defeat. As soon as the girl returns and the game is resumed, Dev moves towards the closest wall, resting his back against it.  Six stripes on the table, one for each pocket. Penny rolls the blue square across her stick, stalking the felt. Elbowing down to the ledge, she calls out every shot and procedes clockwise to make them in quick succession like she'd set it up and arranged it this way. Except for the eightball.  Poor Greg, he never had a chance. "Oh t'hell with it," his hand rolling the eight into the side pocket, standing there slack-jawed, pissed off and much poorer than when he started off the night, the bowl full of coins and bills going toward's Penny's end of the table. She has no hangers-on, no one's asking her to buy the next round - this isn't that kind of place, these aren't that sort of people. As she counts out, the coins go one by one into the pocket of the trench and the bills get folded up into her back pocket.  Hana comes in, smoking. She pauses near the door to finish her cigarette, which she ditches in an abandoned glass on the nearest table. Time to start staking out the place. All the regulars know her by now, sometimes irritation in their eyes, sometimes pleasure, as they glance at her wandering form. She walks through the tables, looking slowly from one to the next.  Catherine opens the door and walks into the pool hall. Catherine has arrived. Aaron opens the door and walks into the pool hall. Aaron has arrived.  Aaron smiles to Catherine and follows her gesture to the pool table, 'Sure...but what will the stakes be?"  Hana decides none of the current games are worth it, and starts for the door again.  Devros casts a glance over Hana as she enters, recognizing her face from a few nights ago. His attention soon returns to the pool game though, being held between a drunken local and Penny. It's another casual night at Pandora. More strangers follow, deserving another glance by the shaven-headed freak. Not much of a surprise there either, since there's always someone new to join the fun.  Catherine blushes and gives Aaron a look. She then heads towards the bar, pointing to something on the menu.  Aaron nods to Hana as he passes and moves to join Caterine, nodding to her as he settles down  Hana opens the door and walks out onto the stoop. Hana has left.  Catherine orders a beer. Chuck grunts towards Catherine, then brings the order she ordered. Chuck sends the Catherine's order sliding to the end of the bar, where is sits an waits for Catherine to pick it up. Aaron takes a seat at the barstools. Aaron orders a Hard Cier. Chuck nods and fixes the order for Aaron.   Aaron says "OK..I give up spelling tonight" Catherine picks up the beers, seeing that Aaron made an order himself. Oh well, she heads towards the table.  Watching Penny's display with the cue, Dev has to face she's actually good. Good enough to beat him, perhaps? As the poor sob wanders out to drink his sorrows, the shaven-head wanders towards Penny. Hands are slipped on each side pocket of his trench, and a weak, somewhat half-assed smile is open. "That was a good game..for a newbie, I mean.."  "So buy me a drink, I'll letcha school me" nodding back toward the empty table. Clearly she was good - good enough that all the locals scattered; nobody wants to play her. Still busy rifling through the pockets of the coat, Penny refolds the headphones inside one of the pair of pockets, half looking over her shoulder at Devros "Go on, hey? Something girly," she stresses, at once laconic and louche "with an umbrella."  The business of setting up the table again is Penny's alone. There isn't even one empty mug or bottle for her to bug the waitress about.  Aaron blinks at Cathy and gets up from the tbar with his drink. He smiles, 'Sorry , love...can't stand beer..'  Aaron gets up from the barstools. Catherine takes a seat at the barstools. Catherine shrugs She says something in a language you don't understand.  She sits so she can watch the game that seems to be starting She says something in a language you don't understand.  Aaron takes a seat at the barstools.  Devros blinks in surprise after her first statement, caught somewhat off guard. "..well, that was..straight forward.." He grins, flicking the cigarette butt aside and placing his bottle on the table in front of him. "Oh..right..something girly..with an umbrella..Ok.." He nods to himself a few times. "..I can offer some beer..Cuz, you know..We're out of umbrellas..and girly drinks..." He casts a glance over his shoulder, sizing the couple of strangers briefly, and then gesturing to Chuck, ordering the usual. "..Just don't mind the funny taste.."  Catherine looks after Aaron as he heads into the the bathroom, sitting alone on the chair, swaying her legs and sipping the beer. A blush and a smile as Devros looks her way, then just waits.  Penny racks up stacking in some obscure and arcane numbering order, rolls the triangle forward a few times then finger-tightens the group; no room to move. While she waits for Devros to get back with the drinks, chalking her cue again Penny reaches back into the depths of a corner pocket for the cue ball. She polishes it against her thigh, grime twisting off it in her hand.  Chuck actually makes his way to the pool table, fetching her a pitcher of good ol' Canadian beer and a glass mug before wandering back to his dirty bar. "So, let's just go to the standard questions..", Devros asks, taking a sip from his own bottle. "Do you come here often?"  Perfunctory and effective enough to keep Penny interested, she nods "..but not enough to make a living at it," and she smiles. It's true. Chuck knows her, gives her a hey-what's-up but not much more. Chuck also knows she's dead-serious most of the time. She picks up a mug, wipes it out with the edge of one of her shirts and pours "Next?"  Catherine stays on her stool, but starting to watch the exchange by the pool table more intently.  "Hey, that's good to know." he says, although his tone of voice doesn't make it obvious he meant it. "Hmhmk..Lesse.." Devros looks upwards, thinking to himself. "Okies then, how about your name? Or alias..I don't really care..Just want to keep track of your tabs..", he shrugs lightly.  Drinking while Devros ponders, Penny rounds the corner of the table sweeping out stray bottlecaps from underfoot. "It's Penny." She says that with a kind of telling finality - that it's entirely possible she doesn't care who he is and won't be offering more than that.  "Well then Penny, it's good to meet another face to our humble shithole..", he smiles, brightly at first, but that rapidly fades. "..and lacking any sort of originality, that's pretty much all I have.." Devros chuckles, slipping his hands back down the side pockets. "Next time you're around, bring some cash..I'm sure ripping off these idiots is a profitable side job, but I mean, where's the fun in that?"  Well, since Aaron seems to be gone like, forever Cathy slips off the chair. Sipping her drink.. "Now's the part where you offer me a cigarette," pouring herself another mug "and tell me your name. And then I tell you 'I'm really not in it for the money, it's how I get my kicks' and then we play." Threading the needle of her stance, she's remarkably still. Lower to the table, bending and leaning just so, Penny focuses down the stroking line and exhales, shoots the cue and the loud crack of a clean break splits out.  Still narrating to Devros, Penny watches the balls roll and knock into eachother "And then you tell me 'I don't know if I really feel like playing now' and then I kinda give you this look and wait for a light and I ask 'So why is it I should bring cash?' And you say.." leaving the opening there.  "...Because..of my good looks..? C'mon, that's a tricky question.." He quirks a brow, grabbing the pack from his pocket and tossing on the table. There are only two cigarettes left. "You can keep some greens in your back pocket. A couple of hundreds, maybe? Then whenever I'm around, we play..I'd be more then willing now, but it was a long day, and the kids must be missing me, so..Will have to bring the extra cash on a later occasion.." Devros sighs heavily, turning and making his way across the room, back to the entrance. "Oh..right..Name's Devros..", is said along the way.  Penny fishes out a cigarette, picking off a lighter from someone else nearby. Sure, that was normal. "Pussy," she murmurs around the smoke with a hard glare at the path Devros' parts, tossing the stick to the table.  That about sums it up for Penny. She pulls her things together, headphones go back around her neck, trench gets remantled and sashed gingerly .. for whatever reason.
