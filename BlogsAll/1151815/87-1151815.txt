         Pool Hall - Back Room          The walls of this room were possibly once white, but are now stained nicotine yellow with yet dirtier splotches in places. The dark red carpet seems newer and less obnoxious than the one found in the main hall. Tall lamps stand in each corner of the room, shaded so they cast their light upwards giving the room a certain ambiance.          The central space is occupied by a trio of well used couches with newish slipcovers in dark shades - One green, one red, one blue. Arranged into a vague triangle, a low table sits between them with a black ashtray sat upon it. Against one wall is a stocked mini-bar sealed with a padlock and next to this a rack has been mounted on the wall containing poker chips and cards, similarly locked. The mood of the room is shot to peices by what sits squarely against the far wall opposite the door: The porcelain goddess. One shiny clean toilet with a wooden seat and lid, sitting next to a washbasin. A little way down towards the right corner hangs a payphone. A noticable thing is that it is overly quiet in here, perhaps the walls have been soundproofed as none of the sound from the adjacent hall carries over.  Obvious exits: Door [O]  You paged Quiet with 'Hey'. You paged Quiet with 'Listen, can I talk to the dead girl?'. [waiting... waiting... waiting...] Long distance to Quiet: Penny shakes you. From afar, Quiet is shaken. Wha? You paged Quiet with 'Dead girl.'. Quiet pages: Which dead girl. There are lots. You paged Quiet with 'I wanna talk to her. Can I talk to her? The one we were looking for. that one.'. Quiet pages: How did you wanna talk to her? From afar, Quiet shakes you. You paged Quiet with 'Hi, I'm back. Sorry. SO yeah - wanna contact her. Just a sec'. Quiet pages: Just gotta gimmie the how and I'll be glad to give it a try. :)   You paged Quiet with 'I want to summon her, if she's open to it (spirit 3/corr 1)'. Quiet pages: You don't need Spirit 3. Just spirit 2. May I join you? You paged Quiet with 'I knew that. Honest. Join away.'.  Quiet will be joining you in three seconds. Quiet has arrived.  OOC> Quiet says, "I knew you did. Otherwise I'd have to take your magick license away. ;)" OOC> Quiet says, "Go ahead and pose what it is you are doing."  Penny has a bad photocopy of the girl. The girl in question. It's upside down on the table and she's trying to make it levitate, trying to make it stand up on edge and turn around to face her. Penny says to the photocopy "Look, your parents .. /and/ your mentor were worried sick. We know you're over there so just come this way. Come over here and tell us who got you. We're all really sorry.."  OOC> Quiet says, "Extended ritual?" OOC> Penny says, "If you wouldn't mind. With a wp spend first?" OOC> Quiet says, "I don't mind. How many rolls?" OOC> Penny says, "3 - one to get her attention, one to bring her across and one to send her back." OOC> Quiet says, "That would actually be two different effects. attention/bringing across would be one. Sending back would be another. How many rolls for the first effect?" OOC> Penny says, "we get a reduced diff here in the sanctum, too so.. whatcha think - diff 5? // 2" OOC> Quiet says, "werks for me" OOC> Penny says, "Right on."  [Ed Note: TOTALLY forgot I wasn't actually IN The sanctum, perhaps A Sanctum... props to Quiet?]  OOC> Quiet says, "Bombs away. Fire off the dices."  [Willpower] Penny spends a Willpower point.  Penny rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:  5 8 5 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  Penny rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:  10 4 8 Achieving 2 successes, resulting in a moderate success.  OOC> Penny dances! OOC> Quiet says, "Woot! Very nice." OOC> Quiet says, "Go ahead. Make one more pose and then I'll come in." The paper tilts up.  Even Penny's surprised - she's never attempted something so basic this sober. "The thing is, if you were rubbed out by the same people we're semi/quasi hiding out from? We really need to know, so could you come talk to me?"  The paper tilts up and then it falls off the board. It flutters to the ground where it lays for a moment. Then it trembles and the girl's eyes blink. She gazes up at you. "Who... who are you?" The soft, spectral voice seems to echo oddly from where the picture lies.  Penny pivots the chair and plants her feet on either side of the paper. She leans over, elbows to knees and says in her nicest, most convivial voice "Aw sweets, I'm Penny. Your mentor sent us chasin'after you but you were way ahead of us, weren't you."  "I... I can't be here." She says softly. "He'll know! And he'll find me." The girl sounds fearful. The paper flutters and sweeps along the ground a few steps. As if she were trying to run. "What... what do you want from me?"  "No one can find you if you come on out," she coaxes and offers her hand "Come on out. It's safe up here with me. Come on up and tell me who did this to you, that's all I want you to do - just come up here and talk to me." Penny kicks the chair back and gets down on the floor where the paper is. "I /can't/ leave. I'm bound... I can feel it." The paper shivers again and then she says, "What do you want?"  You say, "Who bound you? Who put you there? WHO? Are you alone?" She's furious and kinda freaked out. Why won't she come out? Penny's actually breaking a sweat. "Who put you there?"  "The dark one... the wax man." The girl responds, her voice still has that hollow echo. "There are so many here... hundreds.. I don't know for sure..." She sounds really scared, alone. "I'm with the Frankenstein... he killed me." Penny seethes, hands fisted "And there's no way to get out? None at all? No door? No window? Hundreds?" Piecing in together, Penny shrieks "He put you inside the figure? WHY? What is it making you do? Does..." and exactly what was she going to say. She's lost her ability to talk, just gaping at the talking piece of paper.  "We are all trapped here... we hear dark whispers from those who have been there from the beginning. That we shall be consumed... burned up. A ritual of some dark purpose... I don't know. But I'm so scared. Dying is one thing... but this means I will never..." Words trail off and the paper quivers a bit.  You say, "Okay, okay. Don't.. I'm coming to get you." Somewhat bravely, Penny declares this with a voice not entirely forceful "Okay? I'm coming. We're coming and .. just .. don't tell anyone. Is there anything you /can/ do?"  "Nothing... there is one here... a little girl. Somehow she got free... but she stays behind. Because if he knows, he'll replace her." The paper trembles again a moment. "I'll see if she can find you... oh no... I hear him... he's coming..." The words trail off and she screams. And then the paper bursts in to flames.  Penny reaches to put out the flames - you never know what Pobble's left laying around. Or that fucking monkey. Who is cowering behind a chair to Penny's left. She takes it out on him "Couldn't you be the least bit helpful Dave? You could've TOLD me. That fucking creep from the record store. And ENID, .. Daisy'll be so disappointed. Dave, get out here. You're on recon. Don't even START" when the Monkey starts to disappear "you know what's going on here," she points to a nebulous space between herself and Pobble's lab "so don't even pretend like you're just working for him, okay?" Penny, she's hysterical.  Pobble opens the door and enters from the main room. Pobble has arrived.  Okay so like, this is how it is:  Penny's out of sight but her hat and jacket are draped across the back of that first couch. Get a little further into the room and there's Penny folded up in some medatative state. Nearby is a pile of ashes. Dave's still chittering in a corner some kind of crazy-sounding shit about Penny torturing spirits.  There is the sound of a key rattling in the lock, one.. two.. three. Click, clock, clack. The door creaks open, the motion coinciding with the exhalation of noxious smoke from the entering individual. Haloed in the barlight-through-drugsmoke haze, Pobble strolls into the back room with a bottle of beer in his non-smoke holding hand. He stops, peering across at David L with eyes that would be curious if they weren't struggling to focus through the haze of potent narcotics. "Whots going on 'ere then?"  You say, "Your monkey's got no balls." A declarative.  Penny's eyelids flutter and her posture slackens. Her spine cleaves her to the couch and she hauls herself up with an elbow climbing into the cushion. "Went a little astral to check it out. We have a little problem," she goes on, not missing a beat "the kid we're supposed to be returning to her Mentor is not-quite-dead and I don't really know if it's responsible to return her ghost to her Mentor or not! I mean.. if something had happened to me I know I'd want to be with you guys in whatever unfinished form. It totally beats an eternity of lonely wandering y'know? All pathetic and unresolved but impotent at the same time?"  "You what what?" Pobble wanders over and plonks himself down next to you on the couch. The motion causes him to expel another little burp of intoxicating fumage. Thin silver topped fingers proffer the black smokestick in your general area as he swigs from his bottle. "That hermetic wench is dead but not forgotten? Where'd you find her?" Putting the bottle between his legs, Pobble extracts a small baggie of white powder from his pocket and throws it at Dave. Dave grabs it and burrows his way into one of the couches. There are sounds of sniffing.  "Mr. Dark put her in the Frankenstein statue.." indicating with pointed finger that she is not in fact having you off "..it's what she said. And there's hundreds more like her. And it's Mr. Dark's doing. Scared the shit out of me when I couldn't pull her through to me. But we have to get her." It isn't nobility or anything like it, in Penny's voice has crept a familiar note; greed. "We're getting paid to and should live up to expectation if not legend." Penny unfolds her legs and pulls the bottle out from between Pobble's. She swigs "So go find that map in Hiro's mess and we'll be on our way."  "Ha ha." exclaims the good Dr sucking down a hearty dose of narcotic bliss as a metaphorical pat on the back. "So I was right. Crazy fucker Cornelius was up to no good the whole time. Can't fuckin' make a wax crowbar my ass." He makes a little wave, "Don't need a map, I knows where that place is well enough." The far couch makes a snorting noise then chitters quietly. Pobble purses his lips, reacing forward to ash into the central cigarette-waste disposal container. "Intrestin'.. Interestin interestin intrrestingg." Repetition causes slurring. Steve lies back lolling head lazily against the back of the couch. Something registers and his noggin rolls to one side - your side - and he asks dazily "You want to go now? Like.. right now right now?"  "No, I want to go when I've had time to think about how stupid it would be to steal a spirit from whatever jail it's stuck inside from really what amounts to an unknown enemy. Keene would kill me for thinking so no, I do not want to wait and /think/. I want to go right now, right now." She was saying all this as she was getting off the floor, getting her jacket, picking up markers from the pen/cil jar. Penny's ready.  Pobble says, "Joo yoo think he's a neffanzi?" The smoke between his lips waggles up and down spuriously as he queries. A hand lazily pats pockets, checking for supplies in the face of unexpected action. Drugs, check. Weaponry, check. Monkey under sofa snorting cocaine, check. Inclination to elevate one's position from couch, absent. Pobble closes his eyes for a moment, "Not later later?"  You say, "Now now, right fucking now. Get up, get that fucking monkey and let's get in the car and drive. I don't know shit about what he is but I want him to know we can't stand that kinda shit. Not a fucking minute of it." She checks her own pockets; nothing but lint. "Look I don't wanna kill the guy, I just want to get the kid so you got a gun or something? Just in case?"  The chemist nods, and seems to concentrate a moment. Dave saunters out from under the couch and moves to Pobble's side as he stands. The smoke is stubbed out and he stretches, yawning. "Fine fine.. I just hope you know what you're doing since I have no fucking idea what's going on." Moving towards you he wraps an arm about your shoulder, "If this all goes town the shitter," A solemn nod, "It was good." Dr Steve's face melts to one side, making it hard to choose in favour of these words being serious doubts as to the survival of the dastardly duo this evening.  [Ed Note: Then, speak of the devil... ] As Pobble steps out...  Keene comes in from the main hall. Keene has arrived.  Smells like something burning. Dark in here but not as dark as it could be.  So Pobble just stepped out for a smoke or maybe to find something to lock Penny in the office with. Either way he's not here and she's making notations in a glossy unfolded map of the Wax Museum. "Ready?" manic, crazy look in her eyes "Oh. Steve." What she says, what she calls you when she's disappointed.  Keene comes in from the bar, spritzing his coat with a little Febreze bottle as he closes the door behind him. He looks over at Penny with his usual unreadable expression, continuing to spritz himself while making his own assessments of the situation.  "Hello, Penny. What are you up to?"  Penny says, "See this is exactly what I was telling Ste" confused a minute "-Steve. .. STEVE!" So annoyed, she grabs the map up in a fist, not realizing. "This is just what I said to him, I JUSt said it to him. He wanted to go later and not now and I knew YOU'D agree with him" accusing Keene of something clearly apparent to her "I hate it when you gang up on me." Like the pout could last long. "The point is she's not quite dead and her Mentor's still paying, right? He didn't say she had to be in one piece, right?"  Long distance to Quiet: Penny is scening out some more of the preamble. You're welcome to watch. Quiet will be joining you in three seconds. Quiet has arrived.  "I was told," Keene says, after a moment's consideration of Penny's incoherent rambling, "that he wished to know what her disposition was. We had no power to prevent her death, since we were informed of this well after the fact. Or so I believe."  Keene fishes a cigarette out of his pocket and rests it between his lips, digging in his pocket for a lighter. "How dead is she, anyway?"  Penny says, "So what, you think he was fishing for info she was actually more dead than alive? Like ..maybe he sent her off on purpose? I never even thought'a that." Her fidgeting paused for a moment, she comes back to life pulling at her clothes - she knocked something over, a paper cup rolls and bumps into an arc on the floor. Inbetween wiping down the wet, Penny looks up at matches hanging off the edge of the table, indicating with a nod "You got anything we can put her in? Like a spare Ronald or something? She got bound once so we can throw her in something til we get back to the loft... y'know, so we don't lose track of her."  As always, what Keene chooses not to answer is more telling than what he actually decides to acknowledge. He walks over to the table, picks up a match, strikes it against something convenient and lights up. The cigarette soothes the turbulence within, at least for a while.  "Does it have to be particular?" asks Keene. "A particular size, a particular shape, a particular color?"  "Nah, anything really" Penny seems sure of it but adds "Bigger than a breadbox? Duffle sized? The thing is we gotta go now and get her and find out what he's doing with the other hundred or so he's got stashed there." She's just about packed up and ready to go.  "Charming," Keene says, completely deadpan. He puffs on his cigarette, turning to head towards the door. "Off we go once again, to our imminent deaths. I'm going to make sure this is on my expense report. I probably have something in the car."  OOC> Penny shakes Quiet OOC> Quiet wakes up. Eh? Wha? Ya need me for sumpin? OOC> Penny says, "Yeah. We're leaving (with an invisible Pobble) for the Wax Museum." OOC> Quiet says, "Okay. My alter evil is there already." OOC> Penny doesn't want to scene with him; unless he's somehow bugged the pool hall's office and knows who I am and why I'm coming. OOC> Quiet says, "He's always there unless he's out for some reason. Whether or not you see him." OOC> Quiet says, "Cornelius lives there." OOC> Penny says, "right so. off we go, non-chalant to unbind a spirit."  -= Jones and Greens =-          There is a mixture of various ethnicities and social backgrounds within this small area, a melting pot all come into one. The very businesses appear to take a culturally diverse avenue of theme. Many smaller stores here can be found selling foreign foods and other rarities such as special health items. Besides the consumable goods, other fine import stores are littered about as well, making this small area more interesting for those that enjoy window browsing.         The nickname of 'Tourist Lane' has been placed upon the area, proving that out-of-towners often stay at a small cluster of higher class hotels. Both those visiting for vacation as well as business reasons can be found in almost equal amounts. Small stands of maps, newspapers, and novelty items can be found down the lane to take advantage of those visiting the city.   Contents: Phineas Obvious exits: Dark Horizon DH  OOC> Penny lets Keene set.  Driving in a black luxury sedan -- an Infiniti of some variety -- Keene and Penny take a trip from the bad part of town to another bad part of town ... the tourist district. The vehicle rolls into a nearby parking garage, where it makes its way to a certain part of the structure that is statistically unlikely to be disturbed by most car thieves or homeless people.  Climbing out of the vehicle, Keene sets the car alarm and begins walking towards their destination. Across his shoulder is his messenger bag's strap, with the bag itself having weird dents in it from an over-large object within.  "This is an exceptionally poor idea, you know," Keene says, deadpan.  Phineas has disconnected.  "Pobble thinks so, too. Don't worry." Penny's a bit keyed up. Sugar-high of a variety unknown to even six-year-olds. She's putting on a pair of wire-rimmed glasses as they walk down the block toward the Wax Museum. The pair look strange among a vacationing crowd, "I wouldn't do this with your approval anyway." She chews the cap off a marker and tips it felt-side down in her back pocket. When it bleeds out, it'll just add to her urban hippy look.  "You realize," Keene says, reaching into his coat, pulling out a hip flask, and taking a swig from it before holstering it once again, "that you need me alive to collect on whatever boon he'll give us for this job."  He puts his hands in his pocket, watching traffic idly as they grow nearer to the museum. "Because I would rather not get Chased."  "Shoulda parked closer."  Penny's head is now in the game. Because when questioned, witnesses usually describe how the angry young person elbowed and shoulder their way through the crowd. So she throws her shoulders back and affects a pleasant, if not sunny, air. She takes a hold of Keene's hand, fellow tourist and tugs him as they close on the doors to the museum.   "Subtle," Keene says, being tugged along. He keeps at least one hand on his bag throughout.           A very nice, plastoral looking building in the busier part of town. Recently rennovated, it has a pleasant facade to it, completely with a large hedge around the property, manicured lawn and topiaries of animals.  You enter the waxworks. The large double doors swing open for you. Dark Horizons Waxworks - Main Room(#1957RJ)          This room is not particularly large. Just an entrance room, really. Heavy black curtains hang over the windows in front, shutting out almost all of the ambient light from the world beyond. The room is lit only by real candles and gas lamps. The air carries an old, almost must scent to it, giving you the sense of walking in to a building centuries old, even though it is a relatively new rennovation.         The walls are mostly wood panelled but not in any particular order. Chaos seems to be theme of the decor. The ceilings are high. Ridiculously high seeming, as if they extended far beyond human vision, in to the pitch depths up above. Something may be lurking up there, even now. In several spots there shelves are set in to the wall. Each shelf is empty. The books themselves appear to be sunken in to the walls, giving the room an even odder feel. The floors are completely bare of any sort of coverings. Just finely polished stone. In the center of the main room is a series of ten chairs. The really nice kind, with deep seats and thick velvet cushions. There is a circular table in the middle of them with two books displayed.         Off to the left side is a smallish office. In the back center of the room, you can see a pair of doors, oaken. One door has the face of a smiling demon, a brightly polished brass nameplate under it says Fiction. One door has the face of an angry, almost leering demon, another brightly polished brass nameplate under this one says Fact. There are no visible handles, just a hole in each open mouth with tongues sticking out.                                 +views available                                  Contents: Cornelius Obvious exits: Fiction FI  Fact F  Out O Keene enters from the street. Keene has arrived.  OOC> Cornelius says, "Please, pose entry. I will be Quiet's extension for scening until otherwise notified that the NPC Cornelius has shown himself." OOC> Keene says, "K."  "Wow look at the doors," she whispers, pretending awe. Convincing. And when she thinks no one's looking, Penny grins at the table and chairs, mutters something under her break to Keene and steers him toward the doors "So which shall we check out first, fact or fiction?" Some kind of open-ended joke, they stare.  The museum is empty. Or so it seems. It's extremely quiet and the lights are extremely dim. It would seem that no one is home at the moment. Keene has a messenger bag over one shoulder that has weird bulges in it. It contains something larger than the bag really ought to contain. He acts the part of a tourist perfectly, having a true gift for deception. Everything from his eyes to his body language reads `sucker' rather than `terrorist'.  "Fiction sounds neat," the suited man says.  Penny was headed that way anyway. But the word 'neat' coming from Keene is enough to stop her mid stride. Puts a bounce on it, heel to toe "But Tommy I heard there was one of *the president* in Fact - can't we go there first?" She blocks the door and handle to the Fiction room; full-on - vamping it up horror-story-style. The door swings open and she leans backwards into the tilt. It even creaks.  Keene generates a put-upon expression as Penny whines at him, moving to intercept her. "Jen-Jen," he says, generating a cutesy name on the fly, "if we go see the President now, it won't be as special as if we saw it last. Hey, be careful --"  He jerks forward into the Fiction room, as if to try to pre-empt her from a spill. Keep moving, Keene.  You enter the door marke Fiction. Dark Horizons Waxworks - Fiction          Welcome to the hall of Fiction. The hallway is filled with a series of scenic wax sculpture of infamous men, women and monsters from literary history. Each one of these is done up fantasically but with enough of a sense of reality in them to create an air of true menace. This hallway breathes life in to dark figures in fiction, the grand literary tradition of horror, both modern and gothic. Each scene seems to be worse than the last. The gore. The expressions of agony, of torment. It's a difficult thing to look at for long. Unless you like that sort of thing.         This hallway is fairly long, wrapping around to the side, probably heading back the way you came. The floors here are rough, unworked earth it would seem. The ceiling here is extremely high, invisible to the eye. Very dark up above. Occasionally you can hear a menacing sort of scrabbling noise in the rafters. As though something were following you as you move along the displays. From somewhere in the darkness, light fog trickles down. It leaves maybe a foot worth of cover on the ground, hard to penetrate.                                  +views available                                  Obvious exits: Out O  Cornelius enters from the main room. Cornelius has arrived. Keene enters from the main room. Keene has arrived.  Penny who is Jen-Jen (Jenny jenny who can I turn to?) makes a grab for Keene on his way past her, slips onward expecting the door to swing shut. Did it? The noise was absent and it's lack settles down into the pit of the stomach. She scuffs her boots down the hallway, commenting as she goes along "Poor Lizzie, doesn't she always get a bum rap.."  The hall of Fiction is extremely quiet. Silent like the grave. Your voices echo strangely in this place. With it's foggy bottoms and large, open tops. Everything here feels... wrong. In a very subtle, difficult to define kind of a way. OOC> Penny says, "awareness rolls?" OOC> Cornelius says, "Yes. Awareness + Perc, diff 7 for the moment."  Keene rolls perception+awareness vs 7 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 0:  8 4 10 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  Penny rolls perception+awareness (7 dice) at a difficulty of 7:  7 -1- 2 5 3 5 3 Achieving 0 successes, resulting in a failure  Keene grabs onto Penny, trying to keep her upright. Once they're through the door, though, he releases her and adjusts his messenger bag strap. "Wow, this place is creepy," he says, the master of understatement.  OOC> Penny says, "You'd think MY odds were better."  "Jeepers Freddie," she elbows him and laughs in a pretty careless way "You should hear yourself. I bet it's just the temperature change - all that dry ice in one place tends to get a little on the stale side a few hours in." On the whole Penny's pretty blase. Or good at faking blase.  Penny's good. Keene is better. He laughs in that overly loud American way, making an exaggerated `spooky' face. "But bad ventilation is spooooooky," he says, like Count Chocula.  +view of Frankenstein's Monster: Dark, dreary gothic village setting mayhaps provide you with some sense of where this takes place. Several small vllage huts are in the background. A moon hangs high in the sky. Apparently some of the fog generators must be above this display because it is foggy also, excess spilling to the walkway. In the scene you can see Frankenstein's Monster in all of it's terror and pity provoking grandeur. It stands there, face weirdly illuminated by a greenish light. In it's arms is a small, broken body. A young girl with a wilted daisy still clutched in her right hand that hangs out loosely. Her eyes are glassy, lifeless. She seems to stare out at you, jaw broken and hanging. The monster itself has a mixed expression of horror at its actions and savage triumph.  "Come this way," sounds cheerful and curious about what's around the next corner. Penny turns in toward the dark, gothic village setting. "Now is that what they're paying to see?" She looks at the broken kid-statue, arms folded, head tilted - judging. She walks to it's side - not to get a closer look but maybeb to keep out of it's direct line of sight.  Keene, meanwhile, blunders forward and transposes himself between Penny and the statue -- reading her body language, knowing how this game works. He stares at something inconsequential off to the side of the statue, doing his best cow-eyed tourist impression. "This reminds me of that movie, with the guy," he says. Keene works for Clear Channel. He knows all about inane banter.  The display of the Frankenstein's monster seems almost brooding. The girl's vacant eyes quite oddly seem to follow Penny's movements. You don't see them move... but wherever she is standing, the eyes seem to be looking.  OOC> Penny says, "I'd like to do another roll. Matter/Prime myself - raise my body temperature the better to melt the statue's two pair of eyes." Cornelius pages: How do you mean, exactly? Not sure how that effect would work. You paged Cornelius with 'As a foci-related effect: Wax melts at 138 degrees so via foci: Penny can write 138 degrees on her hands with the magic marker and radiate body heat of that temperature, using prime she can hurry along the damage to whatever trap is keeping the girl's spirit lodged in the figure.'. Cornelius pages: Mmm. You would need a lot of successes for body heat alone to have that impact. Unless you were very close to the statue. Like, right next to it on the display. Long distance to Cornelius: Penny intends to put her hands on it. Cornelius pages: Okay... then pose the action first and then I'll call for rolls.  Concealed briefly, Penny backs up into Keene and casually writes all over the backs of her hands. The Sharpie stink is strong. New. "Open the bag, just unzip it" Penny's turned Keene around to explain with brief gestures and in some other language what it is she intends to do. Melt the eyes, break the cage, catch the girl and run. Really fast.  Keene unzips the bag casually, making it look like he's looking for something. "Shoot, I should get a picture of this for Leroy," he says, but unzips the bag too far -- a box-shaped object falls out, sliding onto Penny's feet. It isn't very heavy. Meanwhile, various papers also fly out, causing Keene to chase after them and gather them up in his arms. "God damn it!" he says, fumbling with the various sized press releases he gathered off the fax machine for this purpose. Nothing like a klutz to draw attention away from a peyote-soaked maniac.  You paged Cornelius with 'this is where I'd turn and hit the statue.'. Cornelius pages: As a formality, please do me a favor and pose stepping on to the platform to do this. Long distance to Cornelius: Penny didn't see a platform in a desc. You paged Cornelius with 'Did I miss it?'. Cornelius pages: I am sorry. It's nothing specifically statted. And unneeded really. Don't sweat it.  When Penny steps close to the display and she passes the area where that is the boundry of the scene, the air ripples slightly and she simply vanishes from sight.  Cornelius pages: When you step across the boundry, you feel a faint tingling of your skin. Then you find yourself standing in a forest at night. In the distance is a small gothic village where the lights are lit. The air is extremely chill and there is a breeze blowing. In the distance you hear the sounds of an animal.  Keene continues scrambling around, picking up papers around him. Something in the back of his mind warns him something is wrong -- and he turns, seeing (or rather, not seeing) Penny. He keeps picking up the papers, putting them all in the bag and zipping it back up. For a few moments, Keene considers the situation. What to do?  He decides to try something -- Keene picks up the box-shaped object he'd left on the floor (actually, a very small hamster cage, complete with wheel) and eases it past the threshhold of the boundary of the scene with his shoe, waiting to see if anything happens.  You paged Cornelius with 'You think I'd be able to tell if I just stepped into the spirit world? awareness roll?'.
