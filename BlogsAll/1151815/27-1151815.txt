         **Went out and found some more work for us. Don't get to kill anything, but have an IC excuse to rough up a Wraith called Tia Sharpe. Could tie in with the Mary plot... Also go to mouth off Connelly. Generally got ignored. Funny how timid the RP can be if you come on strong.**  You walk out of the cave, your eyes adjusting to the bright sunlight. Entering the grasses of the field, you walk for a ways, until you have reached the highest peak. Rolling Fields          It's a gorgeous sight, even in the dark of night, the brilliant yellows and greens of tall grasses waving in the chill wind, rolling hills stretching off as far as the eye can see. Pure, white stars shine in the breaks of the thick, dark cloud cover above, bringing a mild, yet still chilled, warmth to the vast expanse of land.         As you reach the peak of one of the highest hills, you are able to survey the land as the scent of life washes over you. Almost ninety degrees from the hill with the huge, gaping hole, and far off into the distance there is a massive forest, several deer darting into the trees as you spot it, as if sensing your discerning eye. Immediately opposite it is a large body of water, from which the cave stream flows. Ninety degrees from it, directly opposite the cavern entrance, there rest the ruins of a large stone complex, resting atop another hill, one lone tower being all that remains of the once-majestic structure.         A little off to the northeast (assuming the ruins are north), a small, metallic-bowl structure sits. Long tethers sometimes stretch into the sky from beyond it, connecting to a marvelous airship docked above the bowl. The slender curves and high-tech metals used on the small building are a stark contrast to the ruins just fifty yards away, and it easily gives away who is responsible for such a building.                                  >                                  Contents: Standingwater Cally Viktor Paksenarrion Connelly Obvious exits: Novus Valnastium    The Living Forest    Clear Lake    Hole in the Hill    High-Tech Workshop     Compton tromps out of the cave. His pants all soggy and sodden from his inter-dimensional splunkering to get here. As always, he looks right pissed off having to do it.  Connelly smiles and shakes her head, smirking a little.."So..Viktor...did you go on the rescue mission? I mean..no-one has told me exactly who all went.."  Viktor leans his head to the side so Connelly can see him past Cally and says, "Yeah. It was very interesting... It reminded me very much of a strange science fiction movie. I regret I could not do much, but  I helped transport our party through the natural diasters of the shaken Realm."  Cally looks to Viktor and smiles.. "I'd like that too,.. she walks over to the note Standingwater wrote and hmms.. "what sort of Expert you looking for?  Standingwater hitches his pack up a little on his shoulder. "Can you track down a dead chick? Maybe make her hold still while I put an arrow through her heart?"  Cally hmms.. "dunno if I can, but.. I's sure like to try and be assistance./. this been oked with Jonah? the removal of tia I mean?  Compton flattens a path of grass with his loafers as me marches his way down the hill. A direct line from the 'hole' to the gathering being made.  Standingwater spits to one side before he replies. "I really don't care what El Queso Grande wants. I'm answering to a higher power here. Though I'm sure he'll approve since the Spirit Council met with him about it."  Connelly frowns, and looks at Standinwater.."Standingwater....Why don't you go ask a Euthanatos? They deal with the dead all the time..."  Cally looks at Viktor.. "how about it? Want to join us on this?  Compton stops short of barreling in to anyone, but his bristling demeanor and direct approach leave little to guess as to why he's come. "Got the message." he states blankly, obviously only intended for one person. "My cabal specializes in controlling or eradicating what you seek." he says in his gravelly voice. He's practiced this opening.  Viktor looks between the big group and then finally, back at Cally... How can he resist? He looks to Standingwater and says, "Tracing, tracking, and finding, are my specialty, but I'm afraid I know nothing about the spirits 'ere what my library can tell me. If I work with someone, I could indeed track her, and possibly slow her, or stop her with the power of forces."  Standingwater pinches the bridge of his considerable nose. "Where was all this help when I needed it to deal with that spider beast? Which is still at large and likely babbling our secrets, by the way." Nose pinching done, he eyes Compton. "And you are...?"  Cally smiles.. "well I'm not quite an adept on the paranormal world but.. I do have more then a slight knowledge.. " she looks up at Standingwater. "so how about it? Can you use us?  "I, er, Compton... Invisible College." Compton falters a little, having run out of his predetermined lines, "Keene, as usual is... busy."  Standingwater pinches the bridge of his nose again and mutters darkly under his breath in one of the dozen or so languages he speaks that no one here is likely to know. What was that all about?  Connelly frowns at Compton,"I thought the Invisible College specialized in causing car accidents?  Cally shrugs at the foreign tongue.. of course to her even french is foreign.. "so how about it? Can you use us?  Viktor stifles a chuckle at Connelly's comment and studies the newcomer for a moment. He then looks at   Cally and smiles, seeming happy that shes a persistent gal. He stands closer to her and whispers something to her.  Viktor whispers to Cally.  Compton shifts his gaze sideways at Connelly and stiffens more, "Shuddup bitch." he says with all the grace of someone verbally sparring with a baseball bat.  Standingwater gets this pained expression, which he mostly wipes away with a longsuffering sigh. "Any help will do. There's no grand plan. If you can find her, find her. Grab me by the hair and drag me off to where she is. I'll put this arrow through her and go back to my life of leisure."  "This all pro-bono?" Compton asks, already assuming the answer.  Paksenarrion coughs and looks at Compton as he comments to Connelly, "Beg pardon?"  Connelly frowns,"Paksen...let it go...when they get shot up or something...I will just let them treat themselves..By the way..which of them went with you to Doisettep?  Cally uhms.,. "find her.. well I may need some assistance. I mean I barely know the story Viktor nods. He looks between everyone and says to Standingwater. "If I have someone that can locate spirits, then finding a way past our unique focis, we might stand a chance of locating the ghost. Is there anything else about her as far as looks or personality or anything that might help us locate her?"  Standingwater shakes his head. "Not a clue. She's dead. She's the daughter of a Marauder. Her name is Tia Sharpe. Maybe Abel can tell you more. He met her."  "All you need is the name... A spook is just a spirit... that's all you need." Compton explains in an impatient deadpan.  Paksenarrion makes a face and settles back into a sitting position  Cally looks at Paksen.. "what do you think? think we can do this?  Connelly looks at Paksen quietly...not looking like she likes what is being talked about....  Viktor looks at Standingwater quizically all of sudden. "So what exactly happens when the chair is sat on again? I think you failed to mention that."  Paksenarrion glances over towards Cally, "Do what exactly? You'll forgive me but I was a little distracted at the time."  Standingwater spreads his arms to indicate the realm around him. "All this goes bye-bye. Big boom. Then nothing."  Compton, after many silent moments watching the group in seemingly quiet reflection or murmuring private conversations pipes up with, "Right then. Spook on a stick. We'll be in touch." and turns to lumber back up the hill. Obviously places he'd much rather be, most likely involving a beer and naked jiggling flesh.  Cally says, "well? you wanna help us find Jamaia's spook?" she turns to Jamaia.. "By the way, how she die anyway?""  Viktor pages: what a perverted old hipster...  Standingwater shrugs helplessly, "I haven't had a chance to ask her."  Connelly frowns.."I know someone who could maybe help you, Standingwater...."  You have just received a +recc from Viktor.  Who +recc'd you  When        Why ---------------  ----        --- Viktor           Tue Apr 15  For mini-intro and an insight into /what/                               the Invisible College does  Paksenarrion shakes her head, "I don't think I would be much help in that endevour.."  Standingwater scowls at the sky. "At this point I wouldn't care if the guy with the most iron teeth and plastic bones helps. I just want to get this job done so I can go back to the forest where I belong." Viktor mutters something along the lines of, "I'll get started right away in that case..."  Connelly nods..."Standingwater..do you know a local artist named Mary? She...sees ghosts...."  Compton huffs his way up the hill, his form growing smaller in the distance, but that gaudy shirt keeping him well within eyeshot if one cares to look. Q: Where does one even find things like that to wear any more? A: The Toronto enigma, Value Village.  Heading down the hill and up the other, you enter the cavern's dark entrance.
