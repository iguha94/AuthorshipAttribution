         Rolling Fields                               Contents: Alex Tal Alexandre Jennifer Connelly  Connelly frowns,"And you would rush in without even considering that risk? If you are planning to kill something...then...Plan..oh..wait..that is right...only the holders of the seats are allowed to participate..."  Pobble tromps on out of the ruins, followed by Dave Monkey who has his cigar gripped tight between his teeth as he pulls a 4' square cardboard box along behind him via a length of string. Said monkey does not look terribly pleased at his predicament. Dr Steve however has a slight smile on his face, tapping his cigarette so that the ash floats onto the monkey in a calculated manner.  Alex snort and waves a hand in front of Connelly's eye,"Hello in there... Like I said, Lelio has been a problem for months, more than a year even. I think that alot of consideration has going into this decision."  Alexandre looks between the four of them, then shakes his head, saying, "Well... I pass on the rest of this conversation and will head on out. I believe that this has devolved." He directs his floating ball of soft light over towards the fields and the cave exit. "Good eve..." And then he walks on off towards the exit.  Tal nods in agreement with Alexandre, "I too. I'll go and see how Jesyca and Abel are getting on... or perhaps not." He turns and starts walking off in the direction of the ruins.  Alex shakes his head and turns to head in the direction of the ruins as well, since that is where he was going when he stopped to join the conversation. "No plan is fool-proof. But if we only act on fool-proof plans then we will never do anything."  Pobble stops at the edge of the little gathering, waiting for his companion to catch up. He scans the departing figures, taking a long slow pull on his cigarette and brushing stray ash from the edge of his dress.  "Evenin' awl." he murmers in a sterotyped british policeman manner.  Connelly frowns,"I thought Hermetics could not make plans that could fail?"  Tal has left. The dress wearing blue haired man with the monkey snickers quietly at that.  Alexandre strides across the fields and to the cave. Alexandre heads down the hill and up the other, disappearing into the cavern's darkness. Alexandre has left.  Alex begins down the hill and toward the Ruins. Alex has left.  "Wot's going on 'ere then?" says a tired sounding Dave Monkey, dropping his string and taking a leisurely draw on his cigar.  "I dont know Monkey boy. Seems to be some manner of discussion." replies Dr Steve. "Oi." he continues, pointing at Connelly. "Piker." He calls over. Something seems to dawn on him, and he frowns at the womman, as if trying to remember something. Her name maybe.  Connelly looks at the Monkey,"Oh..just a bit of debate...." She looks at Pobble,"So...when are you planning on fully transitioning before SRS?"  Pobble quirks a brow, looking mildly confused. The relevance dawns on him shortly however and he offers a wan smirk. "I have the right to wear a dress should I feel the need, without it threatening my sexuality in any way. Leaves me free and easy."  "Free and Easy." repeats Dave, smirking in a way that only a monkey can. "You Twat." it adds.  "Pobble reaches into his pocket and pulls out a note pad with a pencil tied to it with string, flipping to a blank page he begins to jot something down, glancing up at you mid way. "Whom intends to attack whom?"   Jennifer is looking at you. Jennifer begins down the hill and toward the Ruins. Jennifer has left.  Connelly ums..."If I tell you, are you going to report it to Daisy? And if she knows...is she just going to take all you guys out to try and take the thing out before anyone can do anything about it?"   Pobble traps his cigarette, then draws, taps, draws the last and tosses it to the side. A step forward quashes it into the earth. "By 'the thing' I'm assuming you mean this Leilo spider critter thing.. Daisy isn't going to take us anywhere. She isn't our leader,." he pauses, continuing his scribbling. He looks between you and the paper a few times. "To be honest, I dont give a shit if this thing is murdering sleepers. Euthies do it all the time and no one says anything."  Connelly nods,"Well..that is what the debate was about....apparently the actual instructions are to mind-wipe this Lelio...kill only if mind-wipe is impossible...but..apparently the decision that it is impossible has already been reached..  Pobble stops his task. Looking down he scribbles one more item, then drops the pencil, letting it hang by its cord from the small pad.  "Mind wipe it whyfor exactly?" he asks. Dave Monkey nods, pulling on his rather short end of cigar. Taking a step back, Dave leans against the cardboard box. "Yeah." he says.  Connelly wells.."Because it knows about Mages, and has threatened to tell the technocracy...."  "It's going to tell the technocrats that Mages exist? That'll be interesting new developments for them eh.." says Dave Monkey.   Dr Steve looks down with an attempt at a silencing glare, ruined by the barely suppressed mirth. "This is the same spider that managed to unawaken that bird right?"  Connelly frowns,"I do not think it was the SPider...I think....she rejected her Avatar....and...in this case, it is the fact that the spider would be telling the technocrats about us, specificly...."  "So, since the mage that went AWOL and decided to reject her Avatar, since for some reason being awakened diddn't agree with her.. since she was seemingly mindwiped, how does the Spider know about 'us'?"  Connelly ums.."Because of things she told him before the Realm's Guardian Mind-wiped her?"  Pobble nods slowly. So does the Monkey, before it pulls the last hot breath from its cigar and tosses it, nudging Pobble in the thigh to stamp it.  "That reminds me, who do the Realm's Guardians answer to?"  Connelly frowns,"As near as I can tell....the Realm itself..."  Pobble rolls his eyes. So does the Monkey. "Which was made by random Hermetics and Choiristers, some time before you got here. It dissappeared and came back and no one really knows much about it or where the nodes that power it are? Right?"  Connelly wells.."It was here when I arrived here..I have no idea who made it....in fact, I do not think anyone really knows...maybe if you could talk to the Guardians of the Realm..."  Jennifer wanders out of the ruins in the distance, slowly closing ground until she has arrived in the heart of the fields.  Jennifer has arrived.  Jennifer pushes back out of the ruins now looking much more at ease.  Connelly shrugs,"I am a Verbena, not a Hermetic...the origin and theory of things do not really concern me...what matters to me about the realm is....it exists..who made it, when, and all that do not matter to me...let a Hermetic worry about those questions.."  Dave Monkey clambers up Pobble's leg enough to retrieve a cigar from the man's pocket. It's in a tin, and the monkey pulls it out under his nose with an expression on its little face that could easily be mistaken for that of a happy pervert. It doesn't light the thing however, being too small perhaps. Instead it runs over to Connelly, holding the end of the cigar like a microphone. "Dave Monkey, here to interview this Irish Wench. Oi. Piker." It calls up, from Connelly's foot. "What is the future of Modern Rock Music?" it asks, in the voice of a serious news reporter.  Meanwhile, Dr Steve frowns. "Fuck." he says quietly, looking between his pad and Connelly and crossing something out, replacing it with something else.   >  Connelly laughs,"The same as the future of all things....to pass and move on...as is the future of this city to crumble to dust as time goes on...." Jennifer stops right at the door and just stares at the monkey and Pobble now. "What the heck..."   Pobble glances at the rearried Jennifer. His hand leaves the pad long enough to wave. He smiles at something, maybe the Monkey and slips the pad back into his pocket. "Dave you Twat." he says quietly, shaking his head amusedly. A last long look at Connelly and he shrugs. "Times to go, things to see, people to do." he murmers. "A pleasure as always."  Dave turns and heads back over to his companion, heading off with him without another word, taking up the string and dragging the Box along once more.
