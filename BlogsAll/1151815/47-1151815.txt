         You journey up one of the trails to the quiet park area. Centre Island - Island Park(#1262RnJ)       The beaches on the island's south side are supervised in July and August. A wide range of facilities are available, including washrooms, drinking fountains, water taps, lots of picnic areas with fire pits, first-aid stations and police. Small beaches, wooded areas, open grass picnic places and a couple of stone garden sites also dot this southern end of the island, creating a nice, relaxing atmosphere to enjoy the company of friends and family. The multitude of bike, rollerblade and jogging trails makes the park land home to many sport enthusiests in the summer months. The park is cleaned and well maintained, groundskeepers can be seen busily cutting grass, picking up carelessly thrown litter or otherwise ensuring the beauty of the island.  Contents: Pobble Obvious exits: Centre Island     //.etro: It is 02:10 am, the dead of night, on Tuesday the 13. day of January, 2009.  Pobble stands on a smaller section of beach, a notoriously easy to spot furry sillouette captured in the moonlight for a second before a cloud dims the glow. Braids shift slightly in the grasp of the wind but remain mostly held down with their implanted implements. A cherry moves slowly as the figure sucks on a cigarette, the smoke whipping around his head with the ocean breeze. He stands right on the waterfront, small waves lapping at his boots.  This place is deserted. Nobody hangs out on a beach in the dead of winter; the winds keep normal, sane people in their place. Penny comes walking up from a beach on the south side of the island, boots tied together by their laces and slung over her shoulder. Jeans rolled up past the knee; they look dark. Wet or stained. Walking slowly toward you along an erroded dune, her footprints are washed away in the ebbing high tide. //.etro: Pobble rolls "arete" at diff 5          For a botch!  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" at diff 5          For a total of 3 success(es). You paged Pobble with 'Tell me what's in your head.'. Pobble pages: Jealousy, lonliness.. Angst monkies.  Something falls from the man's left non-smoking hand. A small capsule, bouncing in the lull of the tide before it gets swept out, a needle's point flashing in the starlight before being pulled into a wave.  The man gasps, and starts to sway as if about to fall. He takes a step back, almost involuntarily but something goes wrong. His right leg bends the wrong way, as if it had snapped at the knee, such a surreal sight it is. The furry fellow falls backwards, landing flat out on the sand arms out to either side in cruciform.  The tide has seemed to take pity on the man, as it retreats further. A weary hand shakes sand from the cigarette before taking another puff, with a sigh.  Mashing down cliffside, Penny picks up the pace a little and books down the shoreline kicking up sand and crunching down seashells. Her hand skims the surface a few times trying to make a grab at the floating needle, gives up on the third attempt.  Dragging weeds and sludge from the lake, Penny trudges back toward the place where you fell and kicks at your foot. "Stop it. He isn't gone, he isn't GONE." She kneels on your right and picks up your wrist, feeling for a pulse "It's a timeshare thing. Jumps around," and feels around in the pocket of the coat for cigarettes. "Where's your lighter, c'mon.."  Indeed there is a lighter, and a crumpled softpack of imported Dunhill 100s. Dr Steve's leg twitches the wrong way, and close up its apparent that his boots are covered in a thick layer of algae, almost gluing them to the sand.  "I know.."       "Its just.. You wondered why Jesus thought it were so bad. He was going to get back up fighting in 3 days, back in heaven. Was no loss right?"          "That was the hard part. Having God turn away. Turn. Away." The line is punctuated with a long drag on the cigarette, illuminating damp sand speckled cheeks, and scratches along the 'crown of thorns'.  He flashes a smile, alas a somewhat lame attempt at one. His empty hand reaches up to his hat, laying off to one side of his head and extracts a small parcel from the band near Cally - The Fool.  The thin, wrinkled plastic sleeve comes loose, a sudden gust shivering it down to the driftwood. For it size, it makes a lot of noise, catching in between fallen branches and the remains of a picked-at gull picnic. Penny makes with the flick-flicking, cornering the cigarette between her lips and twists her body carefully but the trenchcoat slips its knots and blood seeps through her shirts.  Hands cupped just right, she pauses, silhouetted in the crescent moon "Cut that shit out, Jesus was just a man."  The wind dies long enough for her to light up and she tosses the plastic thing square on your chest. "This thing is playing you, playing us. It's a sickness, a virus. It's got up in the blood and it wants something. After new years? I was at this thing and I swear someone was washing my feet" then an afterthought "can feel it when I dream."  She palms the lit end and looks down at you "Is divine euphoria supposed to peak like this? Look at you, you're bottoming out."  A vague smile twists Pobble's lips as if remembering something pleasant. A fingertip rubs at the retrieved paper parcel as his arm returns to rest on his chest. The last draw on the cigarette encompasses the cork coloured filter in its burn, but the noxious fumes don't seem to affect the chemist. A deft fingerflip sends the butt flying and its lifted away on a brief gust of wind.  "Jesus was just a metaphor." Ice eyes swivel to view you, and a now free hand moves vaguely towards your feet at talk of washing, as if drawn of its own accord. The lapping water decides to make an untimely run, almost passing the level of Pobble's boots. One foot avoids the deluge by an uncanny motion of a reversed knee. There's a spasm, with its accompanying facial twist, and his thigh straightens out. Leg returns down hard, thumping the heel into the sand.  "Weird ain't it." He puts the paper parcel in his mouth, gripping it against the wind in his teeth as he retrives a small device from a pocket. A block with a pair of deep grooves, one of which is mostly filled with a silver tube.  Sitting indian-style she agrees "Yes," watching your hand fall short of her feet, maybe "It's fucking weird." Wrists balanced after a fashion across knees, the one with the cigarette hardly moves - the wind does all her ashing for her.  A fog has started to coallesce and rise off the lake; reducing visibility rapidly, the dry haze is almost blue. In the distance a foghorn is blowing and a whistle replies with one long then two short blasts.  She drags long and watches the butt roll down the little incline, watches the white wrapper grey-out in the water "What's that?" indicating with a brief nod to the block.  Dr Steve sits up, and in the hollow of his legs, he places the block atop his coat, extracting the tube. The parcel is retrieved from his teeth and he unfolds it with the extreme patience and dilligence as one would use while constructing an origami statue of liberty. Some deft tapping and arranging results in the pink contents of the package being released into the grooves. He does however, continue to wrangle the paper until it forms the shape of a strange little plane which he releases to the wind.  His hair seems somewhat unruly in the wind, and emits a tinkling as the glass components hit each other. The hat flips over and rolls off to the side, repositioning itself face down and causing the card to fall out and dance along the sand.  "Best Christmas present ever?" he asks, smiling despite his mood - a little of the old Dr Steve showing through. The old, but tired Dr Steve. The silver tube is placed into one of the grooves and shielded from the wind, the block is proffered to you. His gaze shifts from you out to what's left visible of the lake amidst the fog. "Should we die, the world may end." he says, somewhat out of the blue.  The foghorn blasts another short round and ripples move across the lake. Out there is the sputtering hum of a motor boat. A dying engine, choked with brine and other things best left at the bottom of a lake.   "But we're seven days outside the Epiphany," the drug talking again, using Penny's voice to protest something about the timing, the timing is all wrong. Wrestling with this idea, she doesn't realize she's smoked down to the filter and is surprised when her fingertips are singed. She tosses off the cigarette and eyes the tube. Pink's familiar. Looks at the block   "You first."  Pobble shifts on the sand and negociates with his head until it aligns itself with the left hand groove. Taking the silver tube he plants one end in block, one end in nose. A fingertip on empty nostril and shhhhhhht. Eyes close for a second, blinking involuntarily and a catalogue issue smile plants itself square upon his lips. A wobbly hand once more proffers the implement in your direction, and after a second it moves back as Steve slumps back to rest on one elbow. The block still proffered, just further out of reach. Lazy fucker.  "Is he still angry at being trapped?" he asks in a faint warbling tone.  "I told you."  Penny's hand makes a grab for the block and straw, "it wants something. Doesn't stay angry very long, tries to come at me when I sleep but there's Jesse's place and he can't get in" and seeing as Pobble hasn't expired she doses just as fast. Doesn't smile though. It doesn't hit her the same way. Knuckling into her nose both sides, Penny shakes her head, elbows down on the silty pebble sand. Sun's starting to come up so she keeps her eyes on the horizon.  "He moves in mysterious ways." they said. Pobble shrugs, bringing up his apparently unbroken knees and hugging them against the cold, with fists clenched as not to bloody the material. His coat shifts in the wind, patterns forming and unforming in the shag of the fur.  "I'm still working on DivComp3. It'll be.. interesting. Need to do some study.." he pauses to shudder with some euphoric glint in his eye. "And reprocessing. We'll see.." He turns from you again, following your gaze to the sunrise.
