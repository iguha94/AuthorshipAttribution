         Here's the log. It's missing a pose from me, I think, near the beginning. Pardon the bad posing and etc. We really had to rush it cuz I had to bail soon :P  You enter the shop.  Queen of Wands - Main Shop(#6966RlJ) 	This shop seems to fall somewhere in between small and large in the scale of size, though it can be hard to get a feel for just how big, or small, it actually is. The layout is a bit haphazard, with little twists and turns created by the setup of the shelves, resulting in little nooks in unexpected places. Upon these shelves is a variety of wares to suit the pagan shopper. Near the front is a selection of jewelry, as well as some of the higher priced ritual equipment, such as wands and athames, all kept behind a locked glass counter. Lining the walls are myriad shelves containing books, organized into sections such as 'Goddess Worship', 'Celtic', 'Psychic Arts', 'Divination' and 'Native Arts'. The books range in quality from the serious, to obvious fluff.. something to suit all tastes. There are the old standbys such as 'Dancing the Circle' and 'Drawing Down The Moon', as well as your usual horde of Llewellyn books. The rest of the shelves contain what seems to be a constantly changing selection of goods, though things such as tarot decks, stones, herbs, and candles are a constant ware. The air within the shop is constantly scented with mild incense, and music plays in the background, often music over the sound of waterfalls or rain. In the back is a door, with a sign posted listing times when psychic readings and holistic medicinal services are available. 	The shop is lit with discreetly placed track lighting, with the addition of tiny white bulbs dotting the ceiling. If one knows anything about astronomy, it's easy to tell that the stars are in the form of the constellations, and is very well done, with everything in it's proper place. Looking out the plate glass window that overlooks the street, you see it's clear, cool, and breezy..  Contents: Jake Daisy  //.etro: Escalus will be joining your location. Escalus has arrived.  The warning bell rings a good three seconds before Jake pushes open the door and walks in, closely followed by Hiro, it appears.  Cadence enters from the street. Cadence has arrived.  Suddenly, one of Hiro's phone rings.   Escalus says "phones."  Hiro was loitering outside; now, suddenly, he is inside - having slipped in alongside Jake. "Yo," he grunts-more-than-says; swinging his courier bag around to rifle through the interior. He comes up with a cheap, blocky cellphone -- the prepaid variety that doesn't require credit checks, background checks, or using your real name. "Yoallo?" he asks, thumbing 'ok' and lifting the phone to his ear. >> "Hello? Hello? Please don't hang up. My name is Dana Acheson."  Cadence heads into the shop, expecting few if any people around. She carries a book and newspapers under one arm, her backpack over her shoulders. From long habit she turns toward the front counter and starts that way before even looking around. She stops short, just before almost running over Jake and Hiro ahead of her. "Whoa."  To Daisy, the activity she's participating in right now -- leaning sullenly against a wall, aviator sunglasses pushed up to blot out every last photon, is 'hanging out'. To local storeowners and the municipal police, this activity is called 'illegal loitering'.  "...yeah, right, who gave you this number, huh?" Hiro asks his phone, twisting in place to eye Cadence sidelong. He steps aside, expression irritable -- as if Cadence has no right to be here -- and slouches over alongside Daisy.  Jake pulls his sunglasses down to the end of his nose and looks over them as he walks around towards the back of the store. When Cadence comes in, he turns and smiles, "Cade... how you doing?"  >> "Dr. Maximillian Ravenhurst told me I should get in touch with you, but I find the number by . . . adjustment."  Cadence gives Hiro an amused glace as she continues on her way to the counter setting her things down on the edge before hopping up onto her favorite seat. She grins over at Jake, "Good to see you! I see you've found a new sense of style."  Hiro tilts the phone aside, mouthing 'Ravenhurst' in Daisy's direction; expression quizzical. The mic maneuvers back into place. "Yeah, you looking for Peachy K or sommat? I got his number, but he's been kinda busy.."  Daisy doesn't flinch at Hiro's telephone conversation -- -- but you can see the tendons in her neck vibrate with anxiety, and a wave of tension pass across her shoulders, across her back, and down her arms, where it's finally released in a wave of antsy knuckle-cracking. This is not a girl who deals well with unexpected circumstances.  >> "I am looking for Mr. Keene or his colleagues. I need to talk to one of them."  Jake notices no tendons as he walks back over to Cadence, "Huh?" He looks down at himself, "Oh. Ted recommended it. It covered up the vest nicely." He looks up, "Something about a red pill and following a white rabbit. I didn't quite follow him. But this is apparently very universal if you need to more around alot.  Cadence smiles at him, nodding. "It works," she agrees. She keeps her voice down so as not to disturb Hiro's phone conversation across the room, idling swinging one leg back and forth in her position on the countertop. "You're getting to be buddies with Ted, then?"  "...yeah well you got his colleague. This' Stice." Hiro's voice remains super-cool. His expression has waned into outright panic. "Is there uh something I can help you with?"  Jake shrugs, "I... honestly don't know. Ever get the feeling everything you knew was wrong?"  >> "Yes. Would you care to meet me? I know you have no reason to trust me, but I can only say that . . . there are important things than this war."  Cadence nods to Jake. "All the time," she murmurs to him softly. "It's a horrible feeling." she offers Jake her hand, but her attention has now strayed to Hiro and his terrified phone conversation.  "Dude," the young punk girl stage-whispers, peering at Hiro over the gold frames of her aviator glasses, "use your ... whazzitcalled ... craft name. They eat that shit up. And ask him about my petition."  "Yeah well considering I've never heard your name before, yeah." Paradoxically, Hiro abrubtly seems significantly calmer. He isn't in trouble. "I'll meet you somewhere. Is there some kind of problem or summat? You got my attention with the name-dropping, but..."  Hiro hits mute. "Ain' him. Some dude," he tells Daisy, thumbing the button a second time.  >> "You can certainly say there is a problem. There is a wrong that must be righted."  Jake leans against the counter, "I'm trying to figure out what's the truth of the matter... and the deeper I look, the worse it looks." He sighs.  "I know," Cadence agrees quietly. "I had half hoped you wouldn't look. I enjoyed your optimism."  "Yeah well no specifics onna phone, right? Where an' when?" Hiro asks the phone, gesturing at Daisy for a cigarette.  Jake nods a bit, "Optimism based on lies does not a good reality make, I'm afraid."  Cadence half watches Hiro and Daisy out of the corner of her eye, but replies to Jake, "I know. I should have spoken with you about it more. I apologize."  GPCs, a crushed pack, emerge from the pocket of her pants. Daisy offers the entire thing to Hiro, and doesn't take one herself. Her expression is a perfect mirror of Hiro's.  >> "I am the one asking, so I will let you set the tone. I'll be alone. None of my people will be there."  Jake makes a dismissive hand gesture to Cadence, "Oh, Pish Posh. You've done wonders for me."  Cadence insists, "I could have done more. I should have." She makes a face, and is silent a moment, but suddenly says, "I do have a little bit of good news. Some hope, I guess, or at least an idea."Hiro pins his phone between ear and shoulder, shaking out a cigarette. "I don't like the sound of that, man," he murmurs around the smoke fitted between his lips. The pack dissapears into a pocket; a flash of butane flares between cupped hands. "But you can find this, you can find me..." He trails off, voice dropping significantly in volume when he continues.  Jake perks up a bit, "Oh?"  Cadence leans in and whispers to Jake quietly, motioning with one hand toward the newspapers on the counter next to her.  >> "Actually, I cannot. I have no skill in spatial science; this is on purpose. I randomly dialed the right number."  You paged Escalus with 'There's a starbucks at the corner of ... in downtown Toronto. It's high-profile and public. We'll be there in five minutes. If you aren't, meeting's off. You seem like a lucky guy. Catch a lucky cab.'.  Jake nods to Cadence, "Well good for him!"  Daisy now thumbs at the corner of her mouth, disguising an expression that is rapidly becoming even sourer than Hiro's. A glance is cast back to Jake and Cadence, then back to Hiro again.  Cadence nods to Jake, "Exactly. Obvious, but good news. Feel like helping?"  "Come on, Daisy. We gotta go," murmurs Hiro, dropping the phone into his hand, and thumbing 'off'. He hooks a thumbnail into the phone's release, strips away the faceplate, battery, screen, extracts a chip from the center, and leans over the counter to deposit the mess of gutted phone into the trash bin. A flashed 'peace' in Cadence's direction, and he heads for the exit; bending the chip between his fingers to weaken the silicon.  Cadence waves to Hiro in reply.  Jake nods to cadence, "Certainly."  To Cadence, Daisy gives a single explicit instruction. "Burn that," she says flatly, turning to join Hiro on his way out. One hand brushes through her hair; the other grasps nervously at the laser pointer held in her center hoodie pocket.  You leave the shop.  [...] Travel through the city, to Starbucks - 2 blocks away [...]  The rich aroma from Starbucks draws you in.  Starbucks(#547RJM)      In the fashion of all Starbucks, this coffee house is styled after the Italian coffee bars where regulars sit at small table and booths and drink espresso with their friends. It provides a seductive atmosphere, sleek yet comfortable. The coffee preparers, known as 'baristas', Italian for bartender, are busy behind the counter preparing various caffeine filled beverages. The aroma of their creations teases your senses. The counter and the entire room feature plenty of burnished wood and brass. About the place sophisticated artwork hangs on the walls. The sound of soft-rock music can be heard over the continuous murmur of the patrons. Through the front window pedestrians can be seen, glancing back at you as the aroma coming through the front door distracts them.                          -- Places Available Here --   Obvious exits: Out     Daisy comes in off the street following the rich aroma of coffee. Daisy has arrived.  Hiro tugs the door open, wedging it open with his elbow to allow Daisy to follow behind him. He drops a handful of some crumbly green substance -- some kind of broken plastic, perhaps -- in the trash next to the entrance; brushing his hands together as he surveys the place. "Next to the window," he instructs Daisy.  Jesse's invisble friend has tagged along on this Invisible outing. Although his contact to the skinlands is AWOL tonight, he couldn't resist tagging along as the chaos that follows is always entertaining.  "Better switch out all the phones," suggests Hiro's partner in crime, "just as soon as you can. Better do it another place, though, on account of paying in quarters twice might be a tad suspicious." The barrista is watching her suspiciously. Apparently, Daisy's past excursions to Starbucks have gone unsurprisingly badly.  At this time of the morning there is only one person in Starbucks. He's a sandy-haired business-suit wearing man wearing silver-rimmed round spectacles. He's got a John Lennon-y look to him.  They're a feeble disguise, those glasses are, but Daisy still pushes them up as she enters. Better to have a shield against prying eyes, satellites, and god-knows-what-else than to go naked. So, having just snorted a bump of powdered confidence from the hollow of her thumbnail, Daisy struts on across the Starbucks toward Lennon. "You the guy we're waiting for?", she asks.  "I am Dana Acheson, if that is the man you are looking for." He speaks calmly and clearly. "Thank you for meeting me like this. You are friends of Keene?"  Hiro, taking his own advice, seats himself by the window; turning his head to watch the interaction between Daisy and Mr. Lennon. He doesn't say anything further, merely slouching in his seat.  Acheson shifts a little bit in his seat. It is the only sign of his discomfort.  At your table D"My name's Daisy. Daisy Inscrutable. So don't bother lookin' it up, 'cause it's obviously ain't my real name."  Daisy smiles thinly. It's a carefully rationed expression, neither friendly nor unfriendly, neither open nor closed. "And yeah. We know Keene.""  At your table Acheson nods. "We have a saying in the Syndicate, Daisy. Everything's got a price. I need to find out what it will take for you and your friends to help me."  At your table Hiro's hands fidget beneath the table; fingers lacing and unlacing. Finally, a hand rises with a cigarette -- procured from a labcoat pocket -- which he fits between his lips. He doesn't light it. "You're talking. We're listening. Some things not even you can afford, man."  At your table Acheson places his hands flat on the table, a gesture much like poker players use to show that they are ready to begin. "I have already made quite an investment. I am meeting with you, without the Administrator of Toronto knowing about it. This could be construed as treason in some circles, even though it isn't. I need the help of your cabal . . . and just your cabal."  At your table Hiro keeps his eye on the street as he speaks, watching the occasional car cruise past outside. Probably on the lookout for black sedans. "You haven't said what you want, yet," he points out, quietly.  At your table Acheson says "It's usually not a good idea to lay all your cards on the table. This thing has the potential of blowing way the fuck out of proportion and taking a lot of people with it." He takes out his own cigarette case--silver--and pulls rather expensive cigarillos out of it. He takes the time to light his cigar. "I am still gauging you.""  At your table "You're playin' around, man." Hiro comes up with a cheap plastic bic; roasting the tip of his cigarette -- a cheap GPC -- to life. He makes no special effort to smoke it; letting it smoulder silently in the corner of his mouth. He seems adverse to eye contact - keeping his attention on the street. "What we're doing here could be construed as treason, no matter who's name you waved like a white flag. So we're traitors. We've been called worse, you're prolly a squeaky clean fucker. What do you want?"  At your table Acheson says "I want you to help me rid the world of a particularly vile contagion. We all do things that we are ashamed of, even organizations dedicated to the betterment of humanity like ours. This . . . thing . . . I need your help with, is one of the Union's darkest hours.""  Acheson taps his hand on the table, and you can hear the ring he is wearing clicking on it.  At your table and that, that gets Hiro's attention. He looks over; fixes his attention wordlessly on Acheson. "Don't spook on me, aiight?" Unzipped outside pocket on his courier bag -- now hanging at his side -- and he rifles for something.  Hiro unzips his bag, rooting through it, and comes up with a battered black tape recorder. He hits play and reverse; setting it on the edge of the table.  At your table Acheson says "How familiar are you with Bergen-Belsen?"  Acheson freezes as you put the tape recorded on the table. "/No/ recordings."  At your table "I ain't recording shit, man. Taking a precaution you should have taken, and I was too blasted to think of." A thumbnail edges up the volume; it's definitely playing, not recording. Some kind of backwards nonsense interspersed with a murmur of static. "Never heard of it. It's some front, I'm assuming."  At your table Powdered confidence has crossed the line into anxiety and from there into paranoia. The expression on her face is locked into isostasis, lips pressed tremblingly hard against each other. Both of her hands are locked around the laser pointer in her front pocket. "They buried something there," she says, "in a block of concrete, on account of it wouldn't die. The doctor who did it was Dutch something. Maybe from South Africa. It killed almost the entire unit before they put it down. It's still there. Eva told me about it.""  At your table Acheson says "Bergen-Belsen was a concentration camp during the Second World War. It was part of the Final Solution." He raises his eyebrows at Daisy's statement. "I do not know anything about that. I do know that the Construct located there hosted Dr. Rudolph Zauberman and his pet nightmare, Projekt Ubermensch.""  At your table "Yeah so maybe I wasn't paying attention during Hitler week in school." Hiro's cigarette tilts upwards, the cherry's tip flaring. Smoke leaks from his mouth. "So what happened?"  At your table Daisy bobs her head. Once. It's obviously forced, but it's the most she can muster.  At your table Acheson says "After the second world war, when those of us who were called on the carpet for profiting from that madman's reign, they slapped Zauberman on the wrist and sent him to Eden."  At your table Acheson says "You see, no matter how tainted the source data, Ubermensch had very promising results." Sarcasm is evident here. "And success, to some, is more important than ethics."  At your table "Don't you guys have internal people to deal with this kind of mess?" asks Hiro, ashing his cigarette off to one side.  At your table Acheson says "You mean the Men In White? Yes, we do. But whenever you have an organization, you have politics, and there are people on the Amalgam Prime willing to overlook where the Ubermensch Data came from as long as the project continued to produce. No Man In White will go against an Amalgam Prime Ruling." He takes a deep inhalation of his cigarillo. "But we are not all Men In White.""  At your table "Yeah, you aren't the only one with that kinda problem," deadpans Hiro, scrutinizing the tip of his cigarette. "So what happened? And why'd it hit Toronto?"  At your table Acheson says "We . . . our conspiracy, if you want to call it that . . . have managed to . . . terminate all the remaining research members of Projekt Ubermensch, including Dr. Zauberman. We've managed to destroy all the data, even that data stored in the Central Archive, which is no small feat. There is only one last instance of Ubermensch left--one last link before it is gone forever."  At your table Hiro says "Tell you the truth, man, this sounds like it's a little over our heads. But what is it? This have something to do with the crazy shit that hit the streets this week?"  At your table Acheson says "It isn't over your heads. It is right up your ally. We've tried three times to eliminate this last remaining piece, and we've failed three times. By now, FCA7-T and Palmerton must have figured out that it is an internal conspiracy. Therefore, the chance of us actually succeeding is virtually nil. However . . . they may not suspect an attack from a different direction."  At your table "We gotta speak with the others. You understand that. If you can give me a voicemail drop I can leave our decision at..." Hiro trails off, crushing his half-smoked GPC out on the table. "We won't turn it over, even if we decide to assist, you understand. If we find it -- and I think I have an idea what you're referring to -- we'll want to destroy it."  At your table Acheson inhales the smoke. "You cannot share this with the rest of the Traditions here. We have enough data--the Man In White in charge of Toronto keeps careful eyes on you people. We're willing to give you more information, if necessary, to get you to do this.  At your table "I mean -our- decision. Not their decision." Hiro pushes his chair back, getting to his feet. "We don't answer to the locals, man. They're a bunch of fuckin jerk-offs. We'll be in touch, right?"  Acheson says, "Sure. Here is my number. I'll be in town."
