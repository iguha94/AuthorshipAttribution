         You enter the apartment. Room174(#4497ed)       To the right of the entrance is a modest bathroom that is sparkling clean. This room has two queen-sized beds separated by a few feet, with plenty of blankets and large fluffy pillows. Inside the second drawer of the nightstand that sits between the beds is a copy of Gideon's Bible. Across from the nightstand on the far wall is a TV that offers hours of cable entertainment. A note near the TV remote reminds you that pay-per-view adult movies will be added to your bill.      There is a window that overlooks the parking lot on the far side, next to a table with two chairs. Behind the table is the room environmental unit built into the wall, giving you control of the heat and air conditioning.                                                   Obvious Exits: Out    Contents: Keene  //.etro: It is 02:37 am, the dead of night, on Friday the 16. day of January, 2009.  Door to the room bangs open and Penny stands there stomping slush and muck off her feet. "Weather's shit," dropping the coat from her shoulders into elbows further dirtying the hallway. The door closes behind her, kicks off her boots "I hate it here," grumpy and ticked off for any number of reasons, Penny starts emptying pockets to the nightstand.  A notepad, a cellphone, an unfamiliar wallet, a strange set of keys all clatter down to the delaminated surface.  Keene is sitting on the floor, shoes off, jacket hung up neatly, smoking one of his usual cigarettes. He is watching `The Shining' on free cable, which acts as an idle distraction.  As it goes to commercial, Keene looks over at Penny. "Join the club. I can't wait for the Realm to blow up. I think I'll have a little party afterward."  "Well it's ah very homey." "Yes."  Penny stands idle for a minute watching Jack on the screen. Still stripping out of soaked clothes, Penny undresses her way into the bathroom. Walking out of jeans, bloody t-shirts hefted into the sink, you can hear the shower start. She's only in there about five minutes when the shower stops. Returning to the room in another of Jesse's shirts, Penny mutters something indetrminate about Eva loving him more and something darker about Pobble, god and unhelpful asian whores.  "I'm having a psychotic episode, Keene. I need something."  "Up or down?" asks Keene, watching the ice cream scene. A month later Penny responds, chin resting on folded hands  "Down. Way the fuck down."  "Man. I miss my bigwheels."  Keene ashes his cigarette into an empty beer can at his side, reaching into his breast pocket and pulling out one of his customary orange vials. He offers it to Penny. "Valium. Take 'em with a shot of Jack. Good for you."  He looks back towards the screen, puffing on his cancer stick some more. "I wonder what happened to Olive Oyl's career after the 70s."  Penny keeps explaining, turning over a keycard looking for the number. "Found the traitor fuck. Then I found the old man getting his ass kicked.. " intimating that some serious retribution needs doling. Penny pushes down on the stupid child-safety cap but it doesn't open. Tries it again, gets it to pop and fingers out two pills, takes them dry.  "She did this fucked up children's show .. fairy tale movies.. I think she had a total break after this movie."  "Pretty wack," mutters Keene, resting his cigarette on the beer can before pausing to stretch his arms. The hedge maze beckons. "Scary looking bitch regardless. Very 70s."  He picks back up his cigarette. "So where's the Benedict?"  "Those teeth, right?" propping herself on an elbow, shuddering theatrically. "Wheres'a jack .." feeling down around on the floor for the bottle "..him? he's up the block," struggling to find the bottleneck somewhere under the bed "hangs out with some nasty sort. Kinda hardcore but maybe a littel to trendy. Anyways. This spirit says he's always there, never leaves. So I figure we stake it out long enough, won't be.. y'know.. too tough."  Keene grunts. "Fucking shut-ins," he says, as it goes to commercial again. "If these people got laid more, they'd probably be a lot more understanding of Truth. Of course, I imagine fucking cabbages has its own particular charm." He puffs on the cigarette.  "I'll have Hiro go trashing around the place. We'll track his financial movements and behaviors for a while. Then we start systematically leaving tracks for the Black Hats to find. Let them take out the trash."  Success. Her hand ferrets out the elusive and mostly empty bottle, upcaps and swigs. "Ah ah ah, Wendy" she says to the television, chastizing "castles don't have phones."  Fishing around in your top pocket for a cigarette, tiny flecks of blood stain the white double-fold on the inside.  "Is that what we want to do? Why should they have all the fun," slowing down now but not sluggish "Keen-o, that's complete crap... oo I love this part," lighting-up with a stray bic, exhaling over your head "kid's a little fucker 'inne."  "Damn right he is," says Keene, finishing his cigarette and dropping it into the beer can. "Well, it's up to you guys. I just want his ass dropped -- I don't really care how it gets done."
