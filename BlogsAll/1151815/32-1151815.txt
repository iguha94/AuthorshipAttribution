         >> Saturday afternoon, May 3 2003.  Keene goes to a Tradition council meeting, since he's one of the few people sober enough to do it.  Hilarity ensues.  Novus Valnastium -- Council Chamber          This room is mostly empty, even more vast in some ways than the hall outside. Only three things mar its granite perfection; an immense marble table at the head of the room with nine chairs, each marked with a single Sphere glyph, an intricately inscribed Certamen circle in the center of the room, and perhaps forty seats at the back of the room, for observers and audience. A single door to the left glows a soft gold.          The great marble table seems designed with the center chair in mind. Polished and pristine, the table stands as if it had stood here for an eternity, its circle unbroken save the path which leads from between the Seat of Entropy and the Seat of Prime to the new Seat, it's unknown symbol shining a warm golden hue.                            >                           Contents: Cally Marcus Alex Kaze Taliesin Rhiamon Paksenarrion Aaron Jonah Obvious exits: Left Door    Out      Kaze nods in turn and rises, "I am Shinketsu Kaze bani Akashic Brotherhood, leader of the Dharma's Tear Cabal." he says and takes his seat once more.  Jonah says, to Keene, "Just in time, Mr. Keene. Please, take a seat in the Audience."  Keene steps in from the realm. He politely inclines his head to Jonah as he passes through the doors, then moves to an inconspicuous seat near the back of the audience section.  Cally looks over to see who's in the Spirit seat..  Leaning back on the rear legs of his chair, his feet on the back of the chair in front of him, Alex could be asleep for all anyone could know. But then again, this is the same attention that he has given all of the meetings so far and rarely seems to miss anything.  Cally looks out and around the table.. "I'm Cally Grant Bani Electrodyne Diva, head of Team Ether.  Marcus holds up his hand, "Andrew Marcus Yarr, Cult of Ecstacy, sole member of Razor's Edge."  Jonah is studiously taking notes as each name is called out. His pen returns to the inkwell multiple times, indicating that his script is large and ornate; some would say inefficient. He looks up to the Audience, awaiting their call.  Rhiamon says, "Rhiamon Jones House Ex Miscellanea of the Orer of Hermes.Member of the Turris Scientiae"  Keene, after putting his legal pad down on a chair next to him, gets up and makes his usual presentation. "I am Steven Keene of House Ex Miscellanea, of the Order of Hermes. I am the head of the Invisible College." After that, he sits back down, picks up his legal pad, and starts taking notes.  Paksenarrion coughs and speaks up, "Paksenarrion Johanson, I am of the Celestial Chorus.. Independent."  "Alex Hess, of the Virtual Adept," Alex calls out casually,"Member of After-Math."  Jonah finishes writing down the names, then lowers his pen. A glance is cast upon each individual, then to the group as a whole. "Very well. We shall begins this meeting. The first item on the agenda is the formation of a central government for the new Chantry."  Cally nods listening..  Keene takes meticulous notes.  Jonah continues, "The new Chantry shall be divided into two separate governmental bodies. Each shall act as a check and balance to the other. The bodies shall be as follows: The Primary Governing Council shall consist of a voted member from each Cabal, plus one member voted in by the independents. Each representative shall have an equal vote, save for one. Every representative will serve as Moderator for a term of one month or four meetings, which ever one comes first. The Moderator will then pass off to the next representative according to a schedule which shall be drawn up at a later time. The Moderator will serve as a tie-breaker, in that his vote shall carry the weight of two for purposes of determining the result of a tie only."  Kaze listens attentively with his hands folded before him demonstrating that oh so typical detached Akashic serenity.  Alex ... doesn't do much of anything. Reacting to the purpose (or dictated) governmental organization in neither word or action.  Jonah says, "The Governmental Council's primary duties will be to draw up, enact, and sustain a Council Charter. They will be responsible for determining and declaring the laws of the Council and seeing that they stay fair and coherant."  Cally raises a hand requesting to be recognized..  Jonah glances down at his notes momentarily, before continuing again. "The Security Council shall consist of a Council of Nine. Each Tradition in the city shall have a representative present, and it may not be the same representative as from the Governmental Council, save in very exceptional cases. It, too, will possess a Moderator with the same powers as in the Governmental Council, with its own unique schedule." He notes Cally's hand, but does not call on her yet. Instead, he finishes his statement. "The Security Council shall be exactly what it sounds like: It's responsibility will be the security and maintenance of both the Chantry and the Realm, as well as the enforcement of the Governmental Council's laws. They shall be tasked to develop a security policy pursuant to the laws generated by the Governmental Council." Now, he guestures to Cally. "Yes, Miss Grant?"  Cally looks to Jonah. "It sounds as if you're suggesting the primary governing council will act as the Legislative and Executive branch of our Government, with the Security council acting Judiciary? similar to the US Government?  Jonah chuckles quietly, "I was attempting to avoid comparison to other governments, Miss Grant. But yes, I suppose that comparison could apply."  Cally ahs and jots that down.. "thank you.  Jonah looks back to his notes, nods, and picks up. "Each Council, as I said, shall act as a check and balance for the other. Policies are not required to pass both Concils to be effectual; however, with a signifigant majority vote in the opposite Council, a policy may be vetoed. A signifigant majority is equal to two-thirds its total members. This applies only to policies which are reviewed within thirty days of their ratification, and not to existing policies. Existing policies may be appealed at any time, pending review and signifigant majority vote by both Councils."  Hana has arrived.  Alex raises his hand.  Jonah looks over to Alex, "Go ahead, Mr. Hess."  Hana comes through the door, immediately moving to a place from which she can view the proceedings.  Jonah passes a nod to Hana, then seems to note down her presence in the log. Lowering his hand, Alex doesn't bother to rise. "From your description, it sounds like all the members of either council will have to be present to be able to actually get anything done...."  Keene continues to take detailed notes on the proceedings onto his legal pad.  Jonah shakes his head, "No. It will be possible to hold a meeting, but only if that signifigant majority is met. As long as at least two-thirds of the members are present, meetings shall be held. In cases of less than two-thirds yet not less than half, a Council Moderator may hold a meeting and cast a vote, then subsequently send missing Council members a declaration of the vote, explaining the topic and allowing them to cast their vote directly to the Moderator and one other, with the results declared at the next meeting."  No reaction is given to the response to his question. It might even be believed that Alex didn't actually have any interest himself, just thinking that it was something that should be cleared up.  Jonah takes a few fleeting notes, only to look up again. "This issue shall be more formally declared and posted for all to see. Voting for Cabal and the Independent Representatives of the Governmental Council and for the members of the Security Council, where it is appropriate, shall commence soon. Any more questions or comments?"  Taliesin has arrived. Jesyca has arrived.  Jonah begins shuffling through his papers, "If there are none, then I shall continue with the meeting. The next topic on the agenda is the movement of the entryway to this Realm, as well as the potential for the relocation of the Node."  Jesyca tries to slip into the meeting without being noticed, but she's panting a bit from her quick dash across the realm to be here. She begins to walk quietly over to her usual spot, and kneels down there.  A faint smile comes to Alex's face at the mention of moving the node.  Jonah glances over to Jesyca as she enters. He grants her a nod, confirming her presence, then seems to record it in his log.  Keene is sitting in the back of the audience section, taking detailed notes on the proceedings on a legal pad.  Paksenarrion leans against the wall to the side, nodding a greeting to Jesyca as she enters.  Jonah settles his papers before him. "The portal to this Realm is not static. However, it does seem to be somewhat tied to the Shallowing created by the Node below Allan Gardens. The portal should be able to be moved, if we can either tie it to a new Shallowing or if we could possibly relocate the Node. Doing so is very, very difficult and would require more power than any one of us may possess. However, I do believe that, with the aid of the Traditions Council, we might be able to handle this task."  Jesyca flinches a bit when she notices Keene and lowers her head quietly.  Keene shows no particular reaction to Jesyca. He has no doubt noticed her arrival, but appears to be more focused on taking notes at the moment.  Paksenarrion tilts her head and glances at Jesyca curiously..  Alex remains seated in his chair. Leaning back on the rear legs of the chair, with his feet propped up on the back of the chair in front of him. His shade-covered eyes seem to be focused on his feet, but who knows what he is really looking at.  Rhiamon sits quietly listening.  Chase has arrived.  Hana leans bordely against a wall; looking bored only through her appearance of inattention.  Jonah says, "However, such a thing as relocating a Node will require much work and much time. It may even have a noticeable effect to the world around it. As such, it may not be a valid idea. A study should be performed to measure the impact of relocating the Node. We may, instead, need to see about opening a new one, or strengthing one that I believe already exists on the new Chantry grounds."  "How about we steal the one at the vacant lot,"Alex suggests with a small shrug.  Jonah frowns, "Again, relocating a Node may have drastic effects on the environment around it. Hence why I suggest a study."  "What kind of studies?..." Alex asks.  Hiro enters the Council Chambers from the Main Hall outside. Hiro has arrived.  Jonah's frown becomes sharper. "Perhaps you should allow me to speak, Mr. Hess. You are talking out of turn. If you wish to speak, you know the procedure." He sighs, then clears his throat. "Clearly, Mr. Hess, you are not aware of the scientific method. Use it to determine the environmental effects of relocating a Node."  Keene is seated near the rear of the audience section, writing detailed notes on a legal pad. He's gone through a few pages by now.  At some point, Hiro is there shadowing the doorway: record bag over a shoulder -- bulging, no doubt, with assorted and sundry substances which are in no way records -- and hands balled up in his labcoat's pockets. A cigarette hangs from the corner of his mouth, trailing greyish smoke.  Jonah takes notes of the new arrivals as they enter. He grants them a nod to confirm that he has noted them, then goes back to the meeting at hand. "I will need people who are knowledgeable in the material Spheres, as well as the Sphere of Prime, to work together on this study. We will need viable evidence supporting the lack of environmental damage before we relocate a Node of any size."  Paksenarrion raises her hand  Alyx slips in quietly behind those who've also come a bit late, walking silently across to the Seat of Entropy and settling into it. Gloved hands settle on the tabletop and she listens to the speakers, trying to get a feel for what's being said.  Jesyca lifts up her hand slowly, and partially as words sink in and find their way of being processed in her mind. She is in her usual kneeling position.  Jonah guestures first to Pakzenarrion. "Yes, Miss Johanson?"  Paksenarrion coughs and stands up from leaning against the wall, speaking clearly, "I am well and equally versed in those spheres.." Pointing to the Spirit Chair she continues "As well as that sphere. I would be the first to offer my help with that."  Jonah nods to Paksenarrion, noting this down in his book. He glances about. "Anyone else?"  Raising her hand slightly, Alyx sits back and waits for her turn.  Cally raises her hand as well.  Keene continues to take dutiful notes on the proceedings.  Sighting Keene and Penny at the rear of the council chamber, Hiro slides down into a folding chair nearby; settling his record bag across his lap.  Jonah looks to Alyx, smiling. "Miss Davian."  Alex drops his feet to the floor and stands. Gather his sling bag and helmet from the chair next to him, he turns and heads for the door.  "If, in 'material spheres' you mean the three pattern spheres, I offer my small skill in Forces." Alyx volunteers. "Though my understanding of Prime is somewhat limited."  Alex has left.  Jonah nods to Alyx, also noting it down in his books. "Very well. Miss Grant."  Cally answers "I'm not as well ranked as Paksen is but I'm willing to help as well. Which leads a question. How will we be able to work together on this when our Methods differ?  Jonah nods, "That is a valid question. We will not be doing this in a ritual style, for it is more observation and study. In fact, magickal arts themselves may rarely come into play. This will be a /study,/ not an /application./"  Kaze raises a hand slightly.  Jonah says, "Yes, Shinketsu-san."  Kaze folds his hands before him once more, "I would offer my experience with the spheres known generally as Forces and Prime, as well as my Kohai's skills with Matter for this endeavor."  Jonah notes this down. "Very well. Are there any others?"  Keene continues taking notes peaceably.  Cally jots down notes on her end as well  Jonah nods. "If there are no others, then I would like to make one quick annoucement before I wrap up." He stands, organizing his notes. "Shinketsu Kaze-san and Dharma's Tear is bringing in a new member, an acolyte by the name of Hojo Ryoshi. Also, Mr. Aaron Michaels is bringing in an acolyte of his own, by the name of Catherine McGee. I have spoken to both and determined them acceptable for entrance to the Realm. Please give them the respect you would give to any other of our own." He looks about to everyone else. "Is there anything else that anyone wishes to enter into the meeting?"  Cally raises her hand.  Jonah says, "Yes, Miss Grant."  Cally stands up.. "I wish to enter in the meeting about my plan to jam the Hyperion commercials and upload several of ours in their stead..  Marcus frowns a bit, looking over to Cally. First time he's been active this entire meeting, it seems. He doesn't say anything, though, just listens.  Jonah nods and returns to his seat, pulling a fresh piece of paper from his briefcase. "Very well. Please, discuss your plan before those present."  Keene glances to Cally when she speaks again, then starts a new page to write on.  Cally nods and looks out.. "My esteemed Colleagues. I have discussed this plan with those in my Cabal, and a couple of others as well. As many of you know, the Technocracy has the upper hand because of how they can sway the populace. The Hyperion Commercials are ample proof of that. If we can do something to disrupt their message and add mistrust in their public image, I feel we may have a foot in the door to make our part of the Ascension War that much stronger. A suggestion of mine was to take the families shown in the previous two commercials and show them being forced out of their homes because Hyperion desired their locations for businesses. another clip would be of the Homeless shelter located quite near the vacant land also being bulldozed with a sign saying, coming soon Hyperion's new Executive Parking Lot. We can wrap up our commercial showing the families now mixed with the homeless freezing in alley's under buildings suggesting Hyperion has taken over the city. Now my idea can be improved on but that was the example I was hoping to Engineer. " she stops takes a sip of water then continues "However, I wonder now if the idea may be a little late. I've spoken to Aaron who pointed out I should speak to the Chantry on a whole to get their opinion, and to Abel, as any affront to Hyperion may cause them to pressure him. Abel did give his blessing, but a couple of my colleagues did not feel it appropriate. I now open this discussion if I may."  Jonah nods, "Very well. Consider this a forum. Does anyone have an opinion they would like to share on this matter?"  Paksenarrion shakes her head, quietly continuing to listen  Jesyca speaks very softly, and out of turn, "I like it." She then goes back to being a mute on the floor.  Marcus raises his hand, but doesn't wait to be called on, "As long as you don't want to put a park on that lot, I'm fine with it."  "If there are no other opinions to be voiced," Jonah says, noticing the silence on the matter, "I shall speak." His eyes fall upon Cally. "From what I understand of your plan, you wished to 'hijack' the Hyperion commercials and show your own version in their place. I believe that this would serve only to bring the wrath of the Technocracy down upon you and upon others. I believe it would be more fruitful for you to create your commercials as you see fit and then simply air them alongside the rest. This may cost some sum of money, however it is more efficient for you to show your objections to their project in a non-threatening manner. Allow their commercials to air, but air your own. Then you can let the masses decide."  Jonah lays his pen down, leaning forward against the table. "We are not terrorists, after all. Aggressive actions beget aggressive responses. And, also, you should be sure you know everything you can about your enemy before you strike; you should research Hyperion and know what it constitutes before you begin making claims against them that you cannot back up when your claims are presented against you."  Jonah says, "Are there any other comments on Miss Grants interests?"  Cally nods.. "I will discuss this with my Cabal, but I do ask this. Should my cabal and I decide to continue with our plan of hijacking the signal, Would there be repercussions from the Traditions? " she holds up a hand. "I am neither stating nor backing down, as I want my Cabal to have a discussion in this. I merely wish to know what sort of repercussions if any we may expect from our Allies."  Jonah responds, softly, "There will be no repercussions from the Council that I can guarantee, however I cannot guarantee that you will be awarded any support from it, either."  Hana pushes off the wall and slips out the door. Hana steps back out to the main hall. Hana has left.  Cally nods to that.. "I will promise this then. If my Cabal decides to do it, I will of course inform everyone, on the board days before we strike. this way if anyone wishes to help they can, and those who wish not to do it can prepare for any repercussions.. Cally is meaning Techno repercussions  Jonah says, "If there is nothing more on this subject, I will ask once more if there are any other subjects which anyone would like to bring to the meeting."  Alyx raises her hand after a moment's thought.  Jonah seems to wish to add something, looking back to Cally. "Miss Grant, just keep in mind that the Technocracy will likely respond to the Traditions as a whole, and not just to those responsible. Therefore, any harm that comes on anyone outside of your Cabal, should you choose to perform your actions in such a way that causes a response, will fall on your shoulders." He glances to Alyx. "Miss Davian."  "Since she's not here at the moment to make the point herself, I wish to offer up something on behalf of Aaron's student, Catherine," Alyx murmurs. "Though it shoulden't be a problem, I'd like to make it known that she is mute, conversing by means of either sign-language or the written word. Just a heads-up, to help everyone avoid embaressing either themselves or her by commenting on her quietness."  Jonah smiles, "Yes, Miss Davian is correct. Miss McGee is indeed mute. Therefore, keep that in mind if you speak with her. She is not allowed to be out of Mr. Michael's presence when in the Realm, though, so this should not be a problem." He passes his glance about. "Any other comments, questions, or agendas?"  Alyx sits back, glancing around at those here.  Cally shakes her head.. "Just one.. I also sent you a letter a while back about the possibility of setting up a school, where we can exchange skills and training as well as culture so we can learn more of each other.,.  Jonah responds to this, briefly, "As we all know, cross-training between Traditions has always been a sore-spot. It has been attempted on many occasions; unfortunately, for the most part, our ideas of magick are not compatible and thus restrict us from teaching each other the Arts. A school would be an interesting task, but for the purpose of learning about different cultures and perhaps beginning the process of tearing down the walls between ideas, but such is a task which would require many, many years to complete to its maximum effect, I fear."  Cally nods.. "I was thinking more along the lines of weapons training, and unarmed combat myself.. As well as information about the Traditions. Cally says, "err individual Traditions.."  Lifting her hand again, Alyx glances thoughtfully between Cally and Jonah. In response to Cally's comment, Jonah again says, "We are not terrorists. We should not have to fight with weapons combat, and instead with our wits and intelligence." Then, he guestures to Alyx, "Yes, Miss Davian."  "While we're on the subject of teaching and learning, I'm looking for a mentor who's capable of teaching someone of my paradigm. My knowledge of other Traditions is sketchy at best, so I woulden't know who to approach," Alyx voices, looking around again in a semi-hopeful manner. "Teaching in any Sphere I can learn would be appreciated."  Marcus looks across to Alyx, then furrows his brow. "You a Euthie? Talk to me after the meeting..."  Jonah stands again, stacking his papers before him. He looks over the collected group, then smiles. "I fear that this meeting has gone over its time. Therefore, we shall now adjourn the meeting. A formalized writeup of the Councils shall be presented within the week, and information regarding the Node Relocation Study shall also be posted, with a signup so that people who are interested in helping may help. The next meeting shall also be posted on the board, and shall fall soon, so keep your eyes out for it. Please, if there are any more questions or comments, do not hesitate to contact me after the meeting for clarification."  Cally nods to that and gathers up her papers  Alyx rises slowly from her seat, adjusting her gloves before heading over towards Marcus.  Jesyca stirs a bit from her position on the floor. Her head slowly rises, and a yawn comes out of her mouth.  >> Keene's brain shuts off for a while, then switches back on.  Marcus stays sprawled in the Seat of Time, relaxed. He smiles to Alyx as she approaches him, but doesn't move.  Hiro starts awake in his seat, rubbing at the side of his face.  Keene concludes his note-taking when the meeting ends, putting the pad away inside of his jacket.  Cally nods and stands walking to Jonah.. "why don't you come over for Dinner some time? I'd like to talk with you on a few things."  Jonah chuckles as he puts his things away. "I am unfortunately a very busy old man. I will try, but I cannot guarantee anything."  Alyx comes to stand behind the Seat of Time, arms clasped around the top of the backrest. "So," she addresses with a slight smile to the seat's occupants.  Hiro wakes up in stages, which seems to involve scratching his head and working his way down. By the time he's given the old wang chung a good long delousing, he totters to his feet. "It's friday," he informs Keene. Never mind it's nine in the morning. "Let's go get some jim beam."  Marcus looks up to Alyx, then chuckles. "So. Yeah, I've had some luck teaching Euthies here and there. It all depends on their style. At some points, we tap into the same mystical beliefs, so there is some leeway." He kicks up, out of the chair, and onto his feet. "Let's take a walk, see if I can't help you."  Jesyca looks over towards Hiro, and then Keene. She speaks softly, "Hopefully, this time you will not end up causing a disturbance at Overdrives Alley."  Cally nods and grins.. "just give me a call then.. " Cally stands and leaves The Council Table. Cally makes her way out..  Marcus stands and leaves The Council Table.  Hiro fixes Jesyca with an infinitely placid look. The kind of expression a hindu cow might posess. "Excuse me?" he inquires, with improbably good diction. He adjusts the strap of his record bag, unzipping the pouch. "What was that?" Yes; Hindu Cow. Perhaps a hint of pleasant expectance, as if he were trying to catch barely-missed words from a close friend and personal confidant.  Jesyca lifts up her shoulders a bit towards Hiro, and lets out a breath, "It is not one of the best places. A lot has happened there, and several members of the technocracy have come in there, and made it their personal hangout."  Alyx nods and follows Marcus, arms crossed comfortably over her chest as she slips out.  Marcus steps back out to the main hall. Marcus has left. Alyx steps back out to the main hall. Alyx has left.  "And we wouldn't want to compromise your valuable ass-shaking job," drones Hiro, this time through teeth which are more gritted than fixed in a grin. That smile widened. It didn't work very well. "You ever try some cuntish bullshit like that 'gain, we c'n have our next bit'f dialogue in the certamen circle, you catch my drift."  Jonah looks up, between Hiro and Jesyca. "Enough. Hiro, your language is out of line." He looks to Keene. "Mr. Keene, I have heard some nasty rumors about the activities of the College. I suggest you keep your cabal under control."  Keene has sat there quietly and let Hiro talk for a while, not seeming perturbed by Jesyca at all. Keene, after all, is the consummate professional. At Hiro's last comment, though, he puts up his hand to signify silence from Hiro, then gets up when Jonah speaks to him. Jesyca, for now, doesn't require his direct ministrations. "Would you care to share what you have heard, Magister? I, as a rule, dislike rumors."  Jesyca lets out a breath slowly, and looks towards Hiro, "Yeah, the pity, the shame, the idea of there being consequences for actions. The ideas, and attitudes I have watched over the months be presented here, has made begin to question if I really am the right side of the fence. Walk in, cause harm, walk back out, and expect to never get any consequences of those actions."  Hiro goes abrubtly and pointedly silent, neither meeting Jonah's gaze nor fixing it upon Jesyca. His attention, instead, drifts off into an idle middle distance; he retracts his hand from his bag, zipping it quietly shut.  Jonah sighs softly, then shakes his head. "Mr. Keene, perhaps at another time. I would much rather not risk exposing someone who came to me in strict confidence."  "I see," says Keene. "I can entirely understand your reticence to speak publically about a private matter, Magister. Would you prefer it if I made an appointment, at your convenience, to discuss the matter?" He appears sincere in this; perhaps Keene is just a victim of circumstance.  A sharp sniff, and Hiro ambles off towards the exit.  Jonah thinks, momentarily. He nods. "That may be appropriate. Please contact me on Monday, and we shall attempt to schedule an appointment."  Keene inclines his head respectfully. "As you wish it, Magister. Thank you for the opportunity."  Hiro steps back out to the main hall. Hiro has left.  >> Jescya:           Before you is a young girl or woman. She is a delicate five foot four, with a small frame to her body. Her skin is of a pale pallor, needs to be in the sun more often, but it is no different than the average typical neo-goth look. Her eyes are an emerald green, but show a touch of something, and they contrast with her raven black hair. Her hair is long enough to flow past her shoulders and turns up at the ends into a bit of a curl. Her face is a bit angular with a small nose, and delicate mouth with small pouty lips. Jesyca has a slender neck that meets her shoulders in a smooth flow. Her arms are slender as well, and her body is not over or under developed, but seems proportional, making her look pretty, but not beautiful and far from exotic.         She wears her long hair with most it pulled back from her face into a full ponytail. Along side her face are three distinct long ringlets of dark hair. Her face has a bit of make-up on it, a light red color painted upon her lips, and a dash of glitter upon her cheeks. Around her eyes she has on some black eyeliner. Clasped around her throat is a black velvet choker with a single black rose in its center. On a single petal is drop of painted blood.         Over her body is a long, once thick black cloak with a hood. The cloak flows over her body to the ground, dangling just a bit off of the ground exposing a bit of the shoes she wears and dingy gray socks. The cloak catches on the slight curves of her body but hardly enough to bring them to more attention.  Keene, having attended to that particular matter, then turns his attention to Jescya. "Hello," he directs to her. "I believe we have met before?" He puts out his hand to shake, perhaps in a peace-making gesture.  Jesyca gives a bow of her head towards Keene, and looks towards his hand. It takes her a moment but she does take his hand, "Yes, we have."  Jonah gathers his briefcase and his cane. "Good day, everyone."  Keene gives Jesyca a polite but firm handshake, then returns his hand to a neutral position at his side. "Good day, Magister," Keene directs to Jonah as he leaves. After a respectable amount of time, he returns his attention to Jesyca.  "I apologize for the scene that Dr. Alder and Mr. Stice caused at your bar," Keene says. "They were punished for their actions and have been put on notice to behave more responsibly in public. Whatever they did, it was stupid, and not becoming of men of their skill and knowledge." A short pause. "No one was hurt, I hope?"  Jesyca lifts up her shoulders a bit, "Not physically, though Cassidy seems to have decided to continue to stay away from things. I am not sure if that has to do with the various events, or what took place. It is over with, and in the past."  "Of course," says Keene, smiling professionally. "But I felt it was only proper that a suitable apology was given, in a more suitable forum than the front steps of the bar." He adjusts his lapels. "However, if I may offer you a free consultation? In most situations, police officers will treat someone wearing a suit automatically more credible than someone wearing, say, a Winger t-shirt. It is also common to the psychology of individuals who become police officers to be hostile to individuals who question their authority directly." He gestures with his left hand. "Thus, I found it extremely easy to influence the situation in my favor. I, however, meant you no harm; Technocrats in similar situations may have used the power differential created to much more harmful effect."  Jesyca shakes her head a bit, and lets it tilt off to the side slightly, "Last I saw, the real police didn't show up when one of them fried a kid standing right next to me. Guys in black suits walked in, grabbed the body, and walked out. The other man stood up and slipped away. Events like that, and others have made more than edgy when people start causing serious commotions in there. It is not my job that I am wishing to protect, is the owner."  Keene seems legitimately puzzled at that. "And no suspicion of any kind was raised from that incident at all?"  Jesyca shrugs her shoulders a bit, "Technocrats covering up for technocrats. I think those that arrived on the scene deemed it that he took too hard of a hit from the fight he was in. Which might have been believable if you could ignore the smell of cooked human meat, and the way the body reacted."  Jonah steps back out to the main hall. Jonah has left.  "That's amazing," says Keene. "I had no idea the Technocracy was this strong in Toronto."  Jesyca chews on her bottom lip a moment, "I do not know how strong they are, just that a lot of things have happened, and that they seem to be just about everywhere. Before I awakened, I knew several of them. I still do, I'm just trying to hide that I have awakened now."  Keene considers this for a moment or two before answering. "I operate under the assumption that the Technocracy learns everything soon enough, but I happen to be below their interest."  Jesyca gives a slight nod of her head, "I do not know where I lie on their interests, and I never have the intention of finding out."  "A rational goal," Keene says. "You may find it in your best interest to invest in some camoflage, then."  Jesyca cracks a slight smile, "And that is impossible, for me.

Jesyca gives a bow of her head and begins to head off quickly out of the chambers.  >> Keene departs.
