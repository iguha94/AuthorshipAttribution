         Docks(#1156RJ)       The Docks are several long man made quays which protect the ships as they  rest in harbour. The size of these ships range from the smallest commercial  lake ships to the largest ocean going vessels that can make their way down the  St Lawrence Seaway. There are always ships from the USA and a couple from  other countries around the world to keep the docks busy. Like any commercial  docks this one is just as dirty and cluttered, but there isn't the overall  feeling of danger that some large dock areas exude. Toronto is spared the  problems of the docks simply because the docks are on a special made man  peninsula built to house the docks and keep it separate from the city proper.  All told this isn't a picturesque place to visit and there aren't many  legitimate reasons to be here at night. To the north and west is the heart of  the city.  Contents: Obvious exits: Off     Tom arrives from Parliment and Queens Quay. Tom has arrived.  "There's only one instant, and it's right now. And it's eternity."         - Waking Life (2001)          What is the measure of a man? Well, if it happens to be this man, the  measure is just under two meters with a slight paunch to his stocky frame. He  is rather unspeakably average-looking - not dashing, not debonaire, not  handsome. A plain, forgettable face half-covered by a full beard kept in an  admirable state of trim. Decent cheekbones, straightand thin nose, reasonably  good teeth, skin evenly tanned by accidental but prolonged exposure to the sun  in some climate more suitable than this one. Not a bad haircut - but not  exactly glamourous, either; black hair close cropped to the skull, buzzed down  almost to the scalp. Serene hazel eyes gaze out from behind thin glasses,  somewhat discreet oval frames in a low-key matte black.         The clothing is simple, utilitarian. A well-fitted black polo-shirt  with three buttons at the throat. A pair of pressed khakis with a pleat down  the front of either leg, sinched at the waist with a brown leather belt. A  pair of brown leather docksiders. When outside, he wears a large black wool  coat with flat black buttons.    Not the average pedestrian - first impression:         Tall & strong, great teeth, killer body.         The refined sythesis of hard living and regular controlled substance  abuse is as much a draw as it is obvious. It's there in her eyes - give it a  name, call it calculating. With just one look it can be assumed she has  friends in low places.         How does one express truth and beauty simeltaneously? One shaves one's  head. The clean look of her pale scalp, compared to the tan ridges at her  forehead and neck, tells it was done only recently. Not even the fuzz at the  roots remains. It is a perfectly normal skull-shape and bears no mark; cut,  nick or otherwise. She has an incredibly pretty face. An eternity of cheek  bones. Sun poisoning there in tiny bright pink spots; a long neck and a  quantity of cheap-looking gold chains; lips dry and threaded with a  pomegranate stain; applied shadows of gold and brown around green eyes. A  natural angle-shaped eyebrows, sun-scorched blonde and obvious on the skin; a  tan suffered in the desert, a tan that is beginning to peel away. Dead white  slough. Her skin, taut and leathery, wants a pound of prevention, wants to  lose the deeply exposed color it holds. The backs of her hands are scabbed  over, red around the knuckles and nailbeds, yet her fingernails are manicured  ..well painted at least, a titian-red.         She dresses in layers. Loose jeans, jack boots, a fitted t-shirt  (white) under a button-down (suede), under a denim jacket. It's this article  of clothing around which all others revolve. It's fitted, but big enough to  keep her assets in check. Not so much decorated as amplified with patches,  they keep the jacket in one piece, its original seams and thread long gone.  Between the blue-white-red bullseye patch and a black&white John Lennon  likeness is a flat-head thumbtack, white. Across the back panel a fabric  replica of an album cover is safety-pinned (Santana's ABRAXAS) a-typical of  jackets like this.  It's the evening, and a warm front is butting upwards, from the south. The heat slips and slides below the cold front, and a slow fog rolls in. The thrumming groan of fog horns ripples over the water, vibrating through the fog as though it were radio waves through the aetheric medium. Tom is slunk low into his wool coat, the collar turned up around his neck. The faint clip-clop of shoes, dampened by the moisture within the water logged boards on the dock itself. He whistles into the night, whistles as he walks, a neat little tune to take a late evening's walk by.  Noises on the dock, noises beyond traffic and bar trouble; seagulls sleeping and the lapping water beaneath heavy-booted footsteps. Mysterious noises of moored and anchored boats shuttling back and forth, the combined smells of salt and gasoline, the wind spooking the fish. And among these, Penny. Figure out there in the mist, her jean jacket no protection against the weather, a flask and an unlit cigarette her defense. A sailboat's rigging comes loose and knocks violently into a metal post. Bang bangbang, gunshots rippling, forever echoing out to sea.  "Hey, got a light?"  Lost in his own thoughts, in the general swirl of atmosphere, like the end of Casablanca if Raymond Chandler'd wrote it. Deals are done out in the shadows, an Iranian and an extraterrestrial grasping hands in an ancient Masonic greeting back behind some cargo containers. The wind whips up along an alleyway, giving his overcoat an appropriately dramatic flutter. At the stimuli, Tom's attention is called up and away. Eyes float lazily towards Penny... he palms a silver zippo - brings it up in his cupped palm, fingers open. "Yeah." Still a little absent, the words floating up out of him like  exhaust.  She leans in and cups cold hands over his, breathes out past your face and not down. The damp sag in the air makes ash of the end almost immediately. She drags hard again and leans back. "Thanks," cheap wine and stale cologne; things not her own wreathe and claim her posture, slack and sour. The distant remains of laughter makes its way quietly through the atmosphere from the west, a party at the yacht club. Music, too, on the wind in time. A bellow of song and a foghorn in alternate bursts. Penny seems not to notice, her focus somewhere between your burns and her own.  "Welcome, absolutely welcome," comes the distract answer, somewhat unfocused eyes wandering off towards the distant sounds of laughter. A squint through the fog, as though by looking hard enough he could see the source of it. A thoughtful nod as Tom retracts his warm hands - flipping the zippo closed, sliding it away into a pocket on the coat. "Nice night for a party." He withdraws slightly, to a distance permitting dignified conversation. Voice soft, low, "Is that what brings you on a wander out here?"  The fog rolls up and back, harbor lights twinkling in the wake. It must be strange business, whatever the reason, a girl alone on the docks. She nods by way of an answer at first, cigarette pressed to her lips, then offers "Stood up, blind date. Place was beat anyway." Sheltered somewhat from the brunt of the arctic winds, the whistling in the eaves is enough to distract conversation for minutes at a time "You?"  A quick glance over a shoulder to where shadowy men in shadowy robes speak occulted words with their fellows, a storage facility housing much in the way of darkness and forgotten lores. Then, back off into the distance, where the music still wafts through the fog from. "I'm a bit late for it, I think. It'd be more trouble than it was worth to explain it - better, I guess, not even to show up." He drags his palm along the close-cropped hair, looks down at his shoes. "Better not to bother. I only just arrived - I'm allowed."  Men in the distance tend to stay that way; Penny isn't concerned. Theory and practice tell us they'll be disappearing into the ether as silently as they arrived. "You were supposed to be there, huh. Wouldn't worry - they're a little stuffy." She pulls a face, "Yacht clubs," wrinkles her nose at it "not  worth the effort. Tight-laced and buttoned up." Eleven o'clock bells toll from some far-off cathedral and reminded suddenly to some unwritten law, Penny offers quickly "D'you smoke?" fingering another cigarette out of her top-most pocket.  "Well, long story," Tom replies, reaching up to rub his forehead lightly with his fingertips. The eyes wander away from the girl, away from the gatherings, away from the yacht, out into the place where the ocean falls off of the world. Squints some, as though he could see out into that oblivion with only  the help of a bit more clarity. "I guess it's similar to my attitude towards yacht clubs. I go. But I try not to make a habit of it."  Well take it." she won't hear an excuse as a no, extending it toward you  "Should smoke like you drink, always in good company," implying that yacht clubs aren't, that she is. The authority in her slightly drawled words is a fabrication, alcoholic in origin and deliverance. She slouches further out of the wind, making a buffer of her shoulder.   "I don't usually smoke cigarettes, but I'll make an exception for political gain." Tom grabs it with a smooth gesture of thumb and forefinger, flipping it and letting the butt rest between slightly parted lips. Palms the zippo, flips it open again. A quick gesture of his thumb across the flint-wheel. Flame  lurches up and kisses the tip of his cigarette, which ignites with a slow hiss of combustion. "The bird fights its way out of the egg," Tom quotes, as from memory, as a fundamentalist might quote scripture - distracted, meandering, "the egg is the world. Who would be born must destroy a world. The bird flies to God. That God is Abraxas." He's winding his way closer, once more, all comfortable, affable, sociable grin. "Then, here's to good company, Miss...?"  Words murmured as she shrugs her jacket closer together "the highest good and the worst evil" underscoring the quote she follows it to the conclusion, a natural progression in her own smoke and haze. Fancy that. She doesn't stare quite at you but there's a certain concentration lent to that look, a measuring - just how much weight should she give it. "Delightful, Penny" she smiles a little "all the guys call me that on account of I'm not bitter at all," Awl, twice. The tool that makes the tiny holes. "Mister.."  "Blaine. Thomas, or Tom, but rarely Tommy." Steady hands stroke back over the close-cropped hair. "Nice to meet you." The arm offered out, off to the side, in Penny's direction, his body on an axis along the diagonal. Better feng shui, they say. "They call me that because it's what my parents named me, I guess. But I chose Tom. Or it chose me." There's a strange sliding quality to him, perhaps indicative of some excesses taken with his body chemistry, some tinkering with this pill or that drink. The strange extroversion common to the twisted.  Penny can sense it almost immediately; it's the kind of thing that might put out a vibe to the right kind of people. Physical peculiarities that become familiar like the right note in a scale, the third strike, the exact moment when the feedback stops "Pleasure Tom, " and she continues to smoke with her other hand, proximity threatening to burn with her lazy swag.  With a grin, Tom risks it, all for the sake of social interaction. A good firm grip, a light squeeze. The tamest tremor in his hand, rippling up his forearm, an autonomous grip of muscle groups. "Pleasure, Ms. Dreadful." The knowing smile of the clever and the wicked splits his mouth. "I'm thinking we ought to get coffee or something similarly trite. I know a fellow who'll sell a filled thermos of coffee, mostly to the dockworkers, just a few hundred feet or so from here."  Nothing risked, nothing gained, eh? Brighter and more alert, breaking out of miasma. A good firm grip. The genuine article, her responding smile just as conspicuous and conspirtatorial. "Yes, coffee is the best cliche back home" because the accent wasn't enough, she'll walk on if you start on the right foot. "too strong, too hot and you always get what you pay for, yes. Coffee. The guys don't get it," insinuating they're lacking though really it's anyone's guess "never will. S'okay, they're good people."
