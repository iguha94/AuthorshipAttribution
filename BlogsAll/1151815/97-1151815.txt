         To those asking around, it's not too uncommon to find Damian here, particularly when there's new art up. He's here now with Lori and Jerome - and of the three, the seven foot Jerome really tends to be the one that draws the eye at first. Damian's currently eyeballing a painting of a shipwreck with a critical expression, and Jerome's looking fairly bored but well-behaved.  The door opens, admit one Pobble. Or half admit. A second taken to hastily suck the last from a cigarette including a small burn of the filter before he flicks it out past the dirty fella he has in tow. Stepping fully inside the gallery, he lightly adjusts the sit of his top hat as he holds the door for Cash, peering across with a sharp and determined expression. His thin lips are set in a crooked line, silver tipped fingers tapping against the door as he scans the room.  In comes those that don't belong. Unless perhaps, this gallery's patrons tend to be low end. Damian and company prove this theory false. And so Cash and Pobble's entrance goes noticed. Cash, the more sluggish of the two, follows in tow with denim collars propped up against the relentless foul weather of Erin's Valley. Relaxed, slumped and stumbling in alcohol steps. He's concealing a bottle in that jacket of his, no doubt moonshine of grandpa's ripest variety. Hard to follow his gaze behind the drapery of hair that covers. But he's behind Pobble in a purely heterosexual fashion. Eyes fix on the array of free beverages, but he stays the course lain before him by his contemporary. Into the gallery proper.   Lori is actually interested in the art. Her arms are folded across her chest, a bag slung over her head so that the strap lays across her body, boots planted firmly on the ground. "...and nobody does those really great huge, big fucking sea ship scenes anymore where the waves are like 30 feet tall and there's some poor motherfucker hanging from the rigging on the mast and the ship's like hanging in mid air at the top of a wave at a seventy-degree angle n' shit? Man, I love those. They're not ART, but I love them."  Must be that time of day, when people stop by the Gallery for either a looksee of new art, or perhaps a triple espresso from the cafe. For the redhead that soon steps inside, it's for the latter. Kirra is needing her caffeine fix, seriously. Graceful steps take her from the front door towards the cafe where she smiles at the guy behind the counter, "Hey there, Billy. The usual, please?" In hand, she's already got the correct change laid on the counter for him, sliding it across when he hands over the paper cup, "Thanks, Billy. Don't let 'em stress ya too hard today." As she turns away, words are over-heard, and peering into the gallery proper, she sees the trio before the ship picture. "Hey there. " That's directed it Lori with a brief smile before she takes a sip of the strong brew from her cup.  Damian glances down at Lori for a moment, then looks back up at the painting, pursing his lips thoughtfully. "They have movies about that these days, so no one needs it in art anymore. Attention spans like guinea pigs. In ten years, we won't have galleries at all, more's the pity." Though not directed at him he glances Kirra's way, then looks at Lori questioningly.  Lori says, "Géricault? Fuck Géricault, man. Romanticism is a waste of my goddamned time..." The rest of her thought is cut off, and she turns to look where Damian's looking. Monkey see, monkey do. "Oh," she says, "Kirra." This for Damian's elucidation. Lori lifts a hand to wave at her."   Pobble continues to hang near the door, side stepping to stand next to Cash, inclining his head towards the man as his gaze lights on the trio with the obvious bodyguard affliction. "Intrestin'. You know, I asked that old guy about buying that entropic peice. He never got back to me though, the fucker." His attention flicks briefly over Lori and Jerome before settling on Damian, lips pursed in consideration. "Think that might be him?" he murmers to his comrade.  A solemn nod, that's the answer Pobble gets as Cash reveals the libations he's been hiding badly under his coat. Lazy eyes follow a passing gallery goes before his worn sneakers get side tracked by the crackers with the brie. Cheese is good. Cash's spidery grasp scoops up a few appetizers as he passes the server. One is hidden in his pocket, presumably for the never ending winter. And when the chewing's done, he pulls from his dingy and unlabeled bottle. A few small rivers of one million proof run down into his bearded chin.   Kirra's smiles is a bit brighter as Lori speaks her name, a nod given as if to signal the other got it right, "How's your friend? Everything turn up ok with him?" She questions, seriously concerned before she looks to Damian, her head nodding in greet, "Nice to see you again, sir. I hope your day has been pleasant?" Polite is the redhead as she stands there gripping the cup of caffeine, sipping from it at times. Hand lifts, a brush of fingers to tuck away a dark lock, the light shimmering against the few studs in her ear. Cash and Pobble are spared a glance, shadowed green eyes skimming over them both before she turns back to Damian and group.  Damian regards Kirra for a moment, then nods with a small smile. "Pleasant enough," he agrees. "And yourself?" The rest of the room is given what was intended to be a quick glance, but his attention is caught by the rather odd pair that's just arrived. Pobble is merely studied for a moment with a curious look, but then Cash is given a mild but still fairly plain look of disgust. "Lovely," he murmurs to the two standing near him.   Lori shrugs at Kirra, "He's as fine as he's going to get." And that doesn't necessarily answer her question. Lori lets Kirra have at Damian, the pleasantries being exchanged and all. She turns to eye the wall of dark meat behind her and is about to say something but is distracted by Pobble and his hat and his coat. She lifts a hand, waves limply, but glances at Cash. She lifts her arm and glances at her watch. "Whatcha say, huh? Five minutes to the cops get here? Pick a number..." l  The blue haired Pobble raises a brow at the implication, whispering loudly to his companion. "I think she's talking about us mate." He doesn't look away from Damien though, a mildly amused smile forming. With a somewhat glacial pace he begins to head across towards the man, hands sliding down into the oversized pockets of his yeti-like coat. Although eyes are slightly glossy, there is a definate clarity to his expression.  And backing the skinned Polar-Bear, the drunk, having lost his shyness at being less than sober. Though it's only notable by the criss crossing path his sneakers march him. Cash, wiping the remains of munched cracker crumbs clinging to the mop of hair that grows with a will it's own. Bottle now corked, and stuffed back under his coat. Worn like a shoulder holster, complete with form fitting strap. A quick draw on the Bushmills. Fastest drunkard on the west coat. Somewhere behind Pobs, Cash stands. Looking extra casual about their approach.  Kirra nods once to Lori at her answer, no words given to try and say sorry or give condolences. To Damian, the redhead chuckles lightly, her voice an easy alto, "Pleasant enough, yes, even with the weather." Shoulders are given a slight shrug before Lori's words call attention back towards the other two strange men. A quick study, and she asides back, "Ten if they're lucky and the cops are busy."  Damian lifts an eyebrow as he sees the two coming his way, turning to face them, expression going neutral but still slightly curious. Jerome's showing more interest; the man can't really help but loom, gaze fixing as well on the approaching men with more of a warning glare. "Suddenly I appreciate Drew that little bit more," Damian notes idly to Lori. "I suspect I know where this might be heading."  "Well you're the only fucking one," Lori tells Damian, her brow drawing into a delicate scowl. "What gives, Pobs?" Lori asks of her acquaintance. To Damian she says, "This is Pobble." The other . . . gentleman . . . is ignored. Her hands move to adjust the strap of her bag.  Paying no heed to the imposing figure of Jerome, Pobble's smile grows just a small ammount. "Right. I forgot you all had a dress code. I was hoping to find Artus and negociate a deal." he offers, a dry and transparent guise in response to Lori's query. Given the casual hostility, he remains calm and confident, hand removed from pocket to scratch lazily at his chin. Smile becomes a mild smirk as he comes to a halt a short distance from Damian. "I don't suppose you happen to be Griffin?"  Large man, that Jerome. Small man, that Cash. They're now in close proximity, the smaller of the two looking upwards. Though unimposing, he shows no sign of being intimidated by his counterpart. On the contrary. He pulls one of the cracker he pocketed, offering it up between long nicotine stained fingernails. "You wan' a cracker, man?"  A sip, a look, and the redhead sighs, curiously watching the proceedings, yet slipping to the side out of the way. From a painting on the wall, to the gathering group, Kirra looks, brows furrowed slightly as she studies both Cash and Pobble, then the better outfitted ones of Lori, Damian, and Jerome. Hmm.   The name 'Pobble' gets Lori another glance from Damian, and a look of some recognition; precisely how much isn't particularly clear. He looks back at the man, then past him at Cash for a lingering moment. Distaste registers briefly again in the form of a faint sigh. "I am -a- Griffin," he agrees, looking back at Pobble with a small, amused smile. "I'm sure I am not the only one, even in this city. And no, I don't have any spare change. Or cigarettes. Or drugs."   Lori glances around very briefly, satisfied that noone is approaching the extraordinarily odd group of people. Her hands absently adjust the strap on her bag once more while she peers up at Pobble. When Damian speaks, her luminous green eyes flick up at him but soon return to 'Pobs'. Amazingly, she doesn't speak. One may note the position of her stance. That is, she is a step back and to the side of Damian, having given sufficient room for him to maintain his personal space yet remains near enough to touch.  Ooh. Burn. Pobble develops a wan and almost hurt expression that quickly dissapates. "Tres dole, mon ami." murmers the cockney, in a badly affected accent. A silver nail taps his chin before the hand returns to the pocket whence it came. "Damian Griffin?" he asks in clarification, a small glance given to Jerome, perhaps to see if he does in fact want a cracker.  Jerome doesn't seem to want a cracker. The man folds his arms across his chest, dipping his chin and looking down at Cash with a frown. Maybe he doesn't talk.  "Suit yerself, man." And so ends Cash's generosity. The cracker finds its grave in the drunkard's maw. The folding of arms is a distinct gesture of intolerance, impatience, or anger. Take your pick, Cash isn't phased. His callused hands dig into dingy denim caves as he munches up the cheesy snack. And he slouches, dull brown eyes drifting to the art hanging for its life.           "I'm partial to movies, kinda.." His artistic commentary, though it's unlikely to make the latest version of Art Speak. Cash, there's an economy of energy to his movements. Perhaps he stores it in some internal vat, ready for the tapping should a fitting situation arrive.  Glancing up at Jerome nearby, Kirra spares a momentary grin at a thought, head shaking a bit as she holds back a hint of laughter for some reason as she studies the tall guy. Dropping her gaze, she turns back to the two who question Damian, studying them further, listening to the conersation that comes. Espresso is sipped upon, slowly savored by th redhead who doesn't deem words from her important at this moment.  Damian looks back at Cash as the man speaks, and the distaste shifts for a moment into something more ponderous. But not too long, not long enough to be rude or dismissive, before he's looking back at Pobble. "Yes. Damian Griffin."   Lori watches Pobble, waiting. A thumb is stuck under the strap of her bag, potentially ready to pull it over her head. Kirra is forgotten, alas, in favor of the more compelling pair in front of her.  "Interestin'" murmers Pobble quietly. His expression becomes neutral as he slowly slides a hand into his coat, the motion similar to the one he might take pulling a gun. A crooked smile snaps back to his lips, "Been wanting to talk to you, we have."  Lori purses her lips and stares up at Pobs. One hand is extended to the side toward Kirra, a 'come hither' crook of her finger motioning her over. Lori's eyes never leave Pobble.  Inch by inch, attention shifts. Cash is used to glares, though he's the aura of a man accustomed to his lot in life. Kirra, Lori, Jerome, Damian, he's been given those looks one thousand times over, and they've lost their weight. From the mediocre art to the beefcake that stands sentry near him. A lazy transition and he takes his time about.           "You like Kung Fu movies, man?" This, more than anything is disappointing. "You ever seen Enter the Dragon? I've seen that movie four thousand eight hundred times...." Fingers come out from their hidey hole to wiggle in demonstration. Cash caught, fishing for a reaction deeper than arms crossed.  Kirra narrows eyes as Pobbles moves, his hand reaching into his coat. The motion of the finger crooked her way by Lori does gain her attention, the redhead moving behind Jerome and over towards the other female with a quiet step, keeping out of the way of the others as she does so. The look that's given to Lori is of a questioning nature, gaze divided by the other girl, and the guys.   Damian merely continues to regard Pobble evenly, although Jerome slides a hand into his jacket in a mirroring gesture of Pobble's own. The large man is splitting his attention between both Pobble and Cash, though with slightly heavier focus on the former. "So," Damian replies smoothly, "You've found me. Not exactly a huge achievement, but go you all the same. Bear in mind that attempting to shoot, stab or otherwise fuck with me in here would be really quite stupid. Or anywhere else, actually. If you have something to say to me then by all means, you have my full attention."   Lori moves her arm back by about half a foot, extends her index finger and holds it there in a 'wait' sign. Her head is turned to the side just enough so she can watch Pobble and keep an ear canted toward Kirra.  Pobble rolls his eyes, the needle point pupils loosing their fix on the man for the briefest second. "You think I'm some sort of fucking retard?" A terribly oversized boot taps at the floor. "The appearance of a crackhead does not a crackhead make." That's deep philosophy for you, spoken in tones that mock the underestimating statement. He snaps his hand from his coat, fingertips glinting around a crisp eggshell white business card. He twists his wrist, offering the card to Damian face down. In contrast to the sharp style hinted at by the glimpse of its front, the once plain back has been marked with a red sharpee in a ragged X. The smile that accompanies the movement is precise and professional, "We need to talk. Not here. Do call and we can do lunch or somesuch."  "Hey man" Lazy words from chapped lips concealed by overgrown hair. "Like, take 'r easy. 'N I won't snap that elbow out..." Cash obviously now looking a few clicks south of Jerome's face. Mainly towards that hand that so obviously tucked under his jacket. Though he looks anything but threatening, with eyes fluttering on the verge of a drunken black out. Still, his callused hands remove from their denim pockets to dangle on either side of his form loosely.  Kirra strangely obeys the silent command from Lori, her steps paused to the side where she might keep both the other and the men in her sights. Too curious is this whole scene, and Gods know the redhead is the curious sort.  Damian gives a rather disparaging laugh, though it doesn't seem aimed directly at Pobble so much as the conversation. "I don't know you from any other man on the street, and frankly, the majority of them -are- fucking retards. I like to err on the side of caution. So much easier for everyone involved. Lori." There's a command in that, his intention made relatively clear when he inclines his head towards the card the other man is offering. Paranoid, or just an arrogant jackass? Probably both. Jerome curls his lip in an aggressive leer at Cash; the hand doesn't slide back out of his jacket, but he doesn't look like he's right about to whip anything out and start firing wildly, either. Still doesn't say a damn word. Damian's gaze continues to linger on Pobble, then he nods. "A question for you and your companion, since we move in similar circles. Does the name Harbringers Inc ring a bell?" His attention shifts to include Cash as well as he waits for an answer.   Lori leans forward and reaches out to take the card from Pobble quite easily. Damian's command goes into her head, through her nervous system, and into her spinal cord, it seems, so that his will appears to move her slender body rather than her own. The ugly thing is that it's so natural, kind of graceful in a way.  The card relinquished, Pobble's hand returns to his pocket. He goes slip a glance at Jerome, seeming almost dissapointed at the lack of action from the bodyguard, lip pushing out slightly as if he's willing the big man to do something. As he turns back to Damian, his gaze lingers on Lori, a thin peirced brow heading up towards his hat in what could be amusement. Still, he doesn't question, attention fixing once more on Damian. "Harbringers Inc." he repeats pensively, "No immediate tingling of bellage. I can pry perhaps."  "You don' like... talk much, eh? Farrr out." Cash observes, returning the scowl he receives by Jerome with a needy expression. That need, another pull from the bottle stung under his jacket. And so it's uncorked again for a pull. Cheeks filled with whiskey make for a funny smile. One that's wiped by a dingy denim sleeve, tugging with it a few errand strands that are nearly trapped in his lips along with the gulp. His mouth smacks at the sensation. He enjoys it.  Relaxing a touch once the card is offered over, Kirra continues to nurse the cup of espresso, careful sips taken of the still steaming brew. Quiet she remains, at least for now, yet she does straighten, her gaze turned to study Damian's profile from where she stands as he mentions Harbringers. From him to Pobble she trains her gaze, that curiosity growing now as she listens in on the conversation.  Damian nods once to Pobble, though he waits for Cash's reply - or rather, lack of one in regards to his question - before his attention resettles fully on the top-hatted man. "Ahh, well. It's nothing of import, really. I was merely curious." He glances to Lori, hand lifting for a moment to absent-mindedly brush some loose strands of her hair back behind one of her ears, then the hand slides down to take the card from her so he can have a better look at it himself. "I'm sure I will be in touch," he tells Pobble in a more off-hand fashion.  Lori's head tilts about ten degrees to the other side as Damian touches her so he can better access to touch her. She doesn't look at him but looks at Pobble instead, her luminous green eyes affixed on him, trying to see past his third eye and into the contents of his skull, no doubt.   "I hope so. I'd hate to have to track you down again." Pobble replies, as if the tracking was something he'd considered unnescessary to begin with, the tone carrying a subtle implication. He stares in silence for a moment, finally nodding and as his lips once more comform to the proffessional and curt smile template. He steps back, boots heavy on the floor of the gallery. "We'll be seeing you Griffin. Do take care." he states, nudging Cash in the universal Time-To-Go manner.  This signals more wiggling of Cash's callused fingers. To Jerome and Damian mainly, the females of the royal court neglected. A messy spin of his rubber heels and Cash follows in tow. Not as an underling. More of a silent partner. And of course, his path out the gallery passes those tasty cheesy crackers again. One for the road.   Make that two.  Slightly distanced, yet seemingly a part of Damian's group, Kirra remains there behind him, shadowed green eyes watching still. As it appears this little meeting is coming to an end, she relaxes further as she moves another step to the side to now stand at Lori's other side, her gaze attracted by the painting there.
