         Downtown - Jarvis and Dundas(#131RJ)       Empty lots and undeveloped plots of useless land fill this intersection. Old, largely-abandoned factories are set up along the streetside. Development here ceased long ago, apparently. Two major homeless shelters operate in this area, given its rather cheap real-estate value. The area is mostly populated by homeless people, junkies and whores, though the occasional employee of the few operating companies in this area might be seen driving through... generally rapidly.  Contents: Compton Billboard In Front of the Vacant Lot   Obvious exits:   The Co-Op cab pulls up to the curb, and the rear door pops open and Compton hauls his mass out of the back seat of the old Caprice. Handing a $20 and a $5 over the seat to the Jamaican driver, letting him keep whatever change there is... not that there was any offered to begin with.  Penny grouses on the way out the door, bitches while you hail a cab, whining the whole time "I don't wanna, we can go somewhere else, let's get coffee okay? Coffee? I want breakfast. I'm hungry" no she isn't, she's uneasy "look I'll buy, okay? Just.." Kind of a pathetic stream of conciousness. Penny gets out of the cab with Compton's help. "Help." He practically has to drag her out of the backseat.  Unnusually garbed, for her at least, Alyx happens to already be at the vacant lot, looking as if she's either in dire need of chocolate, or contemplating murder.  Compton retrives a satchel from the back seat along with Penny, and gives her an an annoyed look, "Quit yer bitchin, a'right?" he gruffly returns to Penny. The satchel is bulky and looks to weight about half of what Penny does. Looking serious and burdened.  Penny is a pain in the ass. She starts to wave the taxi back toward them, stepping out into the middle of the road "HEY?" arms in the air "Come back!" The shouting she does winds her, bends her forward. She looks suddenly like she's run a great distance, head turned slightly to the side. Cars start honking at her, swerving out of the way.  After hauling Penny to her feet, Compton undoes one strap fo the bag, and pulls a large Saporo can out. This thing is a canon of a beer can. At least 4 liters with a screw on cap and a large handle on one side to facillitate ease of drinking, and with a grimiace he thrusts it towards Penny, "There. Brekkie." he adds.  "PENNY! Fuck head, get back here." Compton yells as she bolts from his offering and in to oncomming traffic, far fast than someone of Comptions size and girth could move, so he starts to make his way across the street to gather Penny and move closer to the vacant lot.  Glancing over at the shout, Alyx notes Penny's odd antics, beginning to head after the woman herself. Not encumbered as much as Compton is, she manages /not/ to get herself knocked down by oncoming cars as she heads across the road in persuit.  Busted on all sides, Penny stays put but looking to the opposite side of the street indicating there. Let's go there. Away from the fence. Yeah? Maybe? No. She just waits for Compton to come get her, only noticing Alyx just then. Doesn't smile or anything, isn't in much of a mood as she is in a state.  Compton waddles up on Penny's side , and armpits the beer and grabs her under her arm and just keeps on hauling, not saying anything at this point. Just a look of determined pissed-offness stamped on his mug at this point.Opting to follow the pair, in case Penny decides to make another dash, Alyx fiddles with her gloves until they sit comfortably.  You say, "Fine, she can be overheard saying angrily, "I'll take the BUS back. Look I was just here the other night. Isn't like shit's changed all that much and Keene says we can't" wrenching her arm back, clearly not intending to run again, continuing her rant sotto voce - nigh on a hiss "just go all gangbusters so I SAID I wouldn't so what're we supposed to be doing?"  Reaching the sidewalk, and relative safety from radiator grill smooching in to you Compton releases Penny arm, and drops the satchel to the pavement roughly, "Look," he starts all pissed off like, "Fuck off, kay? Got a job to do here, right?" Yeah, he's grumpy, he's always grumpy. But this time it is different. This isn't a hangover bitch, but a focused more professional twisting of the knickers. "We're just gonna take a look, get some readings and fuck off right?"  Compton notices Alyx finally, and addsa simple nod with a 'Hi.' tacked on to his Penny rant.  "And what /is/ your job here?" Alyx inquires dryly, stood behind the pair. "If it's about the site, I could probably tell you a /bit/."  Compton inclines his head towards the fence and answers, "Wanna see what's makin all the bad karma in there... Penny says there's somthing riping up the dimensional divide in there."  Penny whips around and looks at Alyx like - would she be pitching such a fit if she didn't have a good-enough reason? She uses Compton for a leaning post, holding her right hand to her stomach, belching something foul behind him "Old man, you really need to work on your mixers."  "Node," Alyx quips, ever-so softly. "That's why Hyperion want it. Could be that's what's causing the 'divide'."  Compton hrms handing the beer canon to Penny again, and peering throught the chain links, "No, I don't think that's it... Penny said there was 'somthing' in there now... somthing new. As of last night."  What the hell. Penny takes the can from Compton and chases whatever she had before with it. Ask any alcoholic, beer's good for the soul. Her attitude improves some, but her mood's still dark as tar "Stuff's dying," tacking something meaningful in there for Alyx "it's all messed up, chaos." In between pulls, Penny hides the can in the big sleeves of her jacket. What open container, officer?  [OOC] Alyx says "Are you calling Staff on this, to see what we find out?" [OOC] Compton was thinking that. [OOC] Penny says "Sure, wave at Cassius?" [OOC] Compton says "Yup." [OOC] Alyx pages 'im. Compton pages: Excuse me Mr. Cassius. We lil mages are poking around the Hyperion site, wanna play? [OOC] Alyx snickers. Compton pages: I'm hoping to gather some info of the 'thing' in the site right now. Photos, readings maybe hands on inspection if I get brave enough. Compton pages Cassius, Penny, and Alyx: Sounds great. //.etro: Cassius will be joining your location. Cassius has arrived. [OOC] Penny says "Oi Cassius :)" [OOC] Cassius says "Oi!"  Compton Penny and Alyx are standing out of the site. Compton has a bag of pseudo techno-gadgets with him.  Penny's got a beer up her sleeve and a puss on her face.  Long distance to Cassius: Penny es'plains: Saw the big machine land the other night. Went to talk to the spirits and all I got was a headful of noise (spirits screaming in agony, dying) so I told the guys, took the night off and now we're back. Against Penny's better judgement.  From afar, Cassius nods. From afar, Cassius knows what's here and mostly knows what's going on. You paged Cassius with 'Rock.'.  "So? Ya got any info like that" Compton asks Alyx, refering back to Penny rather broken description of events last night.  Alyx shakes her head at Compton. "Nope. Don't come by here much. All I know is what was said at Cixi's little party. Going in, or doing this remotely?"  Compton says, "Lemme scan first to be safe. Would perfer not to BnE if I don't have to."  [OOC] Cassius needed to check the jnotes. :)  "I'm not goin'back in there. Fuck no, they got security." Penny backs off a few steps, gets a little air and knocks back more of that beer. "Saw them arrest coupla kids the other night for trespassin'."  With that Compton unbuckles the straps of his satchel and rummages inside, nodding to Penny, "I'da guessed as much. Don't worry toots."  Alyx leans back a little, watching Compton begin to look through his gadgets, deferring to the man's lead for now.  Penny holds out her free hand, knowing Compton'll give her something useful to do sooner or later. "I'm worried, okay?" Looking up and down the block at the junkies fixing, the homeless gathering here and there, lumps on the street "I'm really fucking worried."  Compton pulls out two baton like objects. Made of a maglite type flashlight with a couple of gizzmos duct tapped to the sides and where the light bulb would be housed. Standing he extends one of the tubes to Alyx and says, "Here lady, take this and walk over there a few feet.." he asks her, pointing to Alyx's left and then turns and hands Penny the other one that she was already expecting and points to her right, "Over there."  "It's 'Alyx', Comp," Alyx corrects, though does walk as directed. "Not 'lady'. God forbid I ever act like a lady."  Penny sticks the flashlight in the back pocket of her jeans and starts walking off, hands shoved in her pockets. She shuffles slowly, zipping up her jacket and raising the hood, blending easily into the crowd. The further away from the fence, the better is Penny's theory. Just a few more steps and she's warming her hands over a pharmaceutical-bin fire pit, handing the can of beer off to the nearest body.  "Alyx." Compton says simply as a form of appology, and returns to the bag, producing this time a Polaroid camera that seems to be mounted on the end of a rifle stock and scope. The old style Polaroids, (which he most likely picked up off some venders junk heap in the St. Laurence market) and his rusty, trusty Ether Goggles... some hackneyed gadgets you just can't get rid of it seems.  "So what, we just stand here?" Alyx prompts, holding her tube up and watching Compton curiously.  Compton says, "Um, yeah." He says as if it was obvious, "Over your head and point it in there." Compton adds pointing towards the vacant lot."  Compton with no thought to how odd this is starting to look, dons the Ether Goggles making him look truely absurd. Maybe if it wasn't for the shirt he'd be okay, but that's just not the way it is. Next he lines up the sights on the weird Polaroid-rifle thingy and points it out in to the Vacant Lot, getting as close to the fence as he can.  Laughing with the small group, Penny relates some anecdote with wide gestures. Pulling the rod from her pocket, they shrink back a little "No no, it's not a gun" letting them see it. They pass it around, taking turns pointing it at the fence, trying to turn it on. When it comes back around to her, Penny bangs it a few times in her palm and she too, points it at the fence.    Compton says "Okay, well - the magick part: Matter/Spirit spell. Looking to capture images of the matter and ephemera inside the lot. Going to take 5 picutres. Results depending on the rolls I guess."  Alyx lifts her tube as high as she can, this a little difficult for the 5'2" woman, but managing to get it poked over the fence anyway.    Cassius says "Okie dokie. Page me the PAT."  'PHENOMENON: The local junkies if they are together enough will see the three of us with odd gagets. The two 'flashlights' look inert and project no visible light. The Polaroid-gun just looks odd, but simply spits out 4x4 photos.'.  'ACTION: The two ladies pointing etherically charged maglites in to the coumpound, and Compton with his mounted Polaroid with Etherically senitive film he's made on his own, snapping shots off at the fresh construction site.'.  'THEORY: The Ether-lights are projecting a form of light in to the lot. The polaroid with it's sensetive film will work much like Infrared Cameras work, but on hardcopy and not monitors. The concept is that the Etheric engergy is going to resonate off both solid matetr and ectoplasmic material rendering it visable on the film.'.  Compton steadies himself against the fence and concentarates through the viewpiece.  //.etro: Compton rolls "intelligence+occult" at diff 6          For a total of 0 success(es). Compton frowns...          ... looks up, removes the lense cap and tries again. "Keep 'em up there ladies."  [OOC] Penny snarks her soda. shit. [OOC] Penny snarfs, too. dang.  //.etro: Compton rolls "intelligence+occult" at diff 6          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Compton grins, and starts pulling the trigger snapping off shots.  //.etro: Compton rolls "arete" at diff 3          For a total of 0 success(es).  Somthings wrong. The polaroids arn't developing. Compton starts swearing under his breath, makes a couple adjustments, and lines back up.  //.etro: Compton rolls "arete" at diff 4          For a total of 1 success(es).  Finally, Compton seems to get it all right. Saving what little technical dignity he has left. The 4x4 pieces of film shoot out of the camera in to a clever little hopper basket he has rigged up at the front.  Compton finishes with his impromptu photo shoot. Collecting the snapshots from the basket, he raises his goggles up on to the great expanse of forehead, and takes a gander.  Cassius pages: Ok. Specifically the picture shows what appears to be a large spacecraft. The name on the side reads: ACTIUM. I'll let Escalus know that you were looking."  Cassius goes home. Cassius has left.  Assuming the work is done, Alyx drifts back over to Compton, looking curious.  Penny shuffles back toward Compton, flipping him the maglight "Catch." Her homeless friends don't bother following, working on the beer she gave them. "So. Happy now?"  Compton pockets the snapshots and puts the camera away, then goes and picks up the maglites from where the one was dropped, and the other was thrown when he failed to even try to catch it. "Well, it's a start. Can show Keene and the others these, and maybe with the right spectral anaysis get some more from them. I think you're right though, it's time to split."  "Let's go get you some breakfast." Compton adds, in a pale attempt at making up for dragging you out here.  You say, "Good. Thank you. Okay then, let's go." She raises her hand out to the street, but any attempt to get a cab in this part of town seems pretty thin. "Nah, I just wanna go back to the room and sleep. Still not feeling right."  Compton nods "Alright." points westwards, "There's a TTC stop a few blocks this way." and shoulders his bag moving off.
