         Novus Valnastium -- Council Chamber.          This room is mostly empty, even more vast in some ways than the hall outside. Only three things mar its granite perfection; a perfect marble table at the head of the room with nine chairs, each marked with a single Sphere glyph, a perfectly inscribed Certamen circle in the center of the room, and perhaps forty seats at the back of the room, for observers and audience. A single door to the left glows a soft gold.          The great marble table seems designed with the center chair in mind. Polished and pristine, the table stands as if it had stood here for an eternity, perfectly circular save the path which leads from between the Seat of Entropy and the Seat of Prime to the new Seat, it's unknown symbol shining a warm golden hue.                            >                           Contents: Alexandre Rhiamon Aaron Jonah Obvious exits: Left Door    Out      Alexandre nods, "I left it in the Covenant Library, with Agnetta, for safe-keeping, though I'm sure that Jane has secured it." He smiles knowingly at Rhiamon.  Jonah nods slowly, "It is a possibility that the version you have found may have differences. Each was hand-written, after all."  Compton staggers in, looking rosy cheeked and disheveled. A Paper bag wrapped bottle hanging from his limp hand.  Cally has connected.  Rhiamon has reconnected. Rhiamon has partially disconnected.  Cally nods to Alexandre favoring a warm smile. "Yes I have. I was studying on how to interact with the spirit realm more directly.  Aaron chuckles at something and shakes his head a little, picking up his laptop and slipping from the table  Cally nods to Jonah. "Hello Mageistar  Compton clamps one eye shut, and tries hard to focus from the other one, looking in to the room as if looking through a fishbowl. His countenance frowns and he manages an 'Aww damn...' while swaying in the door way.  Alexandre's attention is diverted by Compton. He stares at him, watching him stagger in. He seems to sigh, just the barest of sighs, before returning to look at Jonah and Rhiamon, "I would like to hear about the differences, if there are any."  Aaron pauses on his way to the door and glances back to Jonah, "Pushing this guy over look bad on the Tribunal?", obviously talking about Compton  Jonah stands slowly, collecting his cane as he does. He grants a nod to Alexandre. "I will inform you of the differences as soon as possible. For now, I must leave." A frown, however, is given to Aaron. "Mr. Michaels, show courtesy to your fellow magi. And, Mr. Compton, please try to be sober on occasion when you visit this place, for the same reasons."  Jonah stands and leaves The Council Table.  Jonah makes his way to the double doors, "Good day, everyone." With that, he leaves.  Compton just looks plain ole confused. First at Aarons comment, as if trying to discern his point, and then at Jonah's as if trying to conjour an excuse... or at least his reason for being here in the first place. All of this fails though and he simply stands there on his sea legs.  Jonah has disconnected.  Cally cocks her head and smiles. "So. what's up"?  Aaron nods and passes Compton iwith a light pat on the shoulder Aaron steps back out to the main hall. Aaron has left.  Compton goes to ask Aaron something as he passes by, but takes so long he misses his chance, now he just looks blankly in to the room as states 'The John?' to anyone listening.  Cally cocks her head. "the.. john? err Bathroom? I.. don't know where it is right now sorry." Cally shakes her shoulder looking confused  Alexandre apparently is listening, stating, "Outhouse is in the back. No indoor plumbing." Then looks to  Cally and offers, "Foray into the Shard Realm of Forces. Fought giant worms and the Fallen. Rescue captives. Trying to figure out the lineage of a book. Standard stuff."  Cally blinks? you.. made it to the planet Mars? and never got words to me? "  Rhiamon smiles wryly, "A lot of poeple are saying that. It was kinda we grabbed people who were there.."  Cally sits down. Now she's the one that looks confused. "Uhm.. can you start from minute 1 please? Alexandre nods to Cally, "It was more than a bit of an emergency. Those who were immediately available were grabbed."  Compton /leans/ up against the door like it is going to save him from drowning, and just closes his eyes tight. Giving up on the whole concentrating on the outside world for a bit.  Cally glances over to Compton.. Ok.. she doesn't know his name but.. "Are you allright? Need someplace to sit? you look a little ill." Compton without opening his eyes simply assumes that the girl is talking to him, and extends his hand waving away and offers of help - obviously he's used to this kind of attention, and doesn't brook with it much. "Isssalright. Jus need a moment." he replies.  Cally ahs softly and looks at Alexandre and Rhiamon.. maybe they can help him or explain. one of the two. Besides she's still wanting an explanation for what happened.  Rhiamon ponders, regarding her left-hand nails, but then relaxes. People seem to get so...testy when blasted by sleet...  Alexandre watches Compton, distracted from regaling his stories of giant worms. He takes a few distracted steps towards Compton, asking, "Perhaps you should get some rest? You don't look good."  l alex         This is a man, not young anymore but not yet middle-aged, sporting black, thin-rimmed circular glasses, with tussled dark brown hair, medium length on the top, short in the back. He has an olive complexion and dark brown eyes, possibly of Mediterranean descent. He has high cheekbones and a thin face, a nose thats a little hawkish, but otherwise plain featured. He has a slight frame and measures an average height.         He wears a dark blue turtleneck and blue jeans. He wears earrings, small, simple silver hoops, in both ears. A couple rings, with red and blue gems, add color to his fingers. A black satchel bag hangs on his shoulder.  Compton heaves open a bloodshot eye and glares back at the now increasing unwanted attention, "Ya think I wanna be here, pasty?" he asks, now getting irritated.  Cally decides not to say anything. she glances back to Alexandre.. ""so.. you were saying something about guests?"  Alexandre tilts his head slightly, "I don't know. I'm not a mind reader. But what I do see is that it looks like someone is going to lose everything in their stomach. And that concerns me. It isn't healthy. "    Cally sighs and sorries. she's getting sleepy as well   Rhiamon just dosed off herself. Sounsd goo dto me Rhiamon has disconnected.  Compton nods again; closing his eyes, and rolls his hand over a few times, motioning to carry on. "A someone not breathing would probably alarm you too, but that doesn't mean it's not normal" he says in a brief moment of clarity, "Tell your stories."    Cally waves Cally has disconnected.  Compton obviously nodded off there, as the next time he opens his eyes, most everybody's gone. "Aww, damn..." he says to himself mostly, grinding the palm of his hand in to one eye. The other hanging on to that bottle as if by magnetism.  Alexandre replies, "Well, not breathing is normal, if you aren't alive." He pauses, then suggests, "If, however, we're talking about you and me, I would be alarmed. If you're saying I shouldn't be alarmed because you throw up regularly, that only alarms me more."  Compton looks real confused for a second or two, as he flips through the card catalog of his short term memory, until he finds a match, "Because that isn't normal for you?" he asks. Obviously put off a little by the direction your point was leaning.  Alexandre offers, "Because it isn't normal for most people." He smiles gently, then looks serious once more. . "I'm still not getting the point..." Compton says obtusely. "You say you are worrying because I am not like the next guy?" He looks truly dumbfounded now as he reaches for the golden nugget on this one.  Alexandre replies, "You probably aren't getting the point because you're drunk and can't tell here from there." He shakes his head slightly, then says, "So when will you finally drink yourself to death? Is that your point?"  "Fuck man," Compton says exasperated, "You sound like Alyx, with all your black and white (makes a 'quotation mark motion with his hands) 'obvious' rules to living a better lifestyle..." he pauses, raises the poorly obfuscated bottle and takes a belt, when he talks again surprisingly sounds more coherent, "Quite frankly, I'm shocked that so many of the enlightened have such a narrow focus on the possible. Perhaps some drink, or shoot, or fuck around to live... What is above so below, and thus some must mirror the opposite to society around them. What is bad is good."  Wow. For those that don't know, that was a hell of a lot of babble from the normally stoic guy.  Alexandre shakes his head slightly, "Some drink, but we're not always babbling drunk. Some of us have sex, but we don't hump everything that moves. And really, you just showed that you're desire to mirror the opposite is just some mid-life crisis reason to do whatever you wanted to do anyway."  You say, "So you, like everyone else that hides up here in your extra-dimensional club house feels the need to make a ruling on someone else's life, hand down divine bits of unsolicited wisdom because.... You /love/ me?"  Compton is sobering fast, although the bottle makes a few more trips to his lips between comments. He's not pleased. What could be mistaken for righteous anger seems to be building in him, of course unless you knew him and then would think such a thing is not only unlikely, but damn near impossible.  Alexandre watches you for a few moments, watching you get riled up. Doesn't say anything for a few more moments, then says, "I suggested you lay down. You chose to insult me. If you could mistake that for love, you are more drunk than I thought."  Alexandre has reconnected.  And with that the fire goes out and the sullen-ness returns to his features. Compton draws what looks like a couple of Polaroid's from his shirt pocket and eyes them for a second, then you, then quietly replaces them from where they came. "Ya know? I honestly don't know why Keene cares so much to help you guys. Help you'd reject because you don't like the massager's shirt." and with that turns to go. The swagger gone and his footsteps merely heavy.  Alexandre watches you turn, walk away. Rubs his chin, then offers, "I hope you have a good rest." He looks to the walls, then opens his satchel and begins to rummage.  "No you don't." Compton reply's in a depressed Eyore kind of way and he's off.  You step back out to the main hall.
