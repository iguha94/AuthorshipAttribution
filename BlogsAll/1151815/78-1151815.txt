         Downtown - Diaz District -= Raven and Pike =-          It is the three-story mall that seems to beckon people from all sorts of financial incomes into the area. Its large parking lot is available for plenty of room for shoppers to fill up their vehicles with its goods and empty their pockets in one easy day. Various crosswalks and shopping centers have sprung up surrounding the mall's center of fame, seeking to draw consumers to their market as well and indeed, succeeding.          Across the street from the mall lies a large shopping center, featuring a large movie theater in its court. Also to draw attention are large fashion stores, everything from the upper end dresses of the year to the inexpensive photography studio to show off your looks to friends and family everywhere. An interesting concept of note is the shuttle bus that moves from the mall to the shopping center across the street, allowing consumers to easily make their way from one area to the next with little effort.  ===============================| +IC Time |================================                    Current Time: Thu Dec 18 14:27:17 2003                     Time of Day: Afternoon (Daylight)    Weather: Overcast Moon: Waxing Crescent         Temperature: 45F (7C)  ===========================================================================  Penny has run off to the goddamn bathroom. Girls going to the bathroom in malls is almost an hour affair. And. You guys have all her purchases. You are loaded with bags. Not just any bags - these are definitely girly-looking shopping bags. An embarrassment and an eyesore.   So. Where there's a mall, there's a food court. where there's a food court, there's cheap food. Where there's cheap food, there's McDonalds. So these three people: one Penny, Hiro, and Compton - a young lady and her disheveled gentleman callers. And they're standing in front of the McDonalds counter, right?  So - Penny's off in the bathroom, /powdering her nose/, dig, and Compton's drunk, and Hiro is arguing with the pimple-faced girl behind the counter, apparently over the contents of the happy meal. There's some contention over the toy.  "They have them in Canada," he tells the girl, glowering. "I swear to fucking god. Where's your manager? Who made you a manager? How can you NOT KNOW?"  Compton looks around lazily like a Hindu cow. MAss consumerism seems to be draining the life from him by the second, with only his belly full of liqour to numb the pain. Mall security would normally be all over this type of guy and sweeping his quietly out the door, but for some reason they haven't noticed him. Most likely a Union outfit has sway here and no one else has screamed 'BUM!' yet. So he continues as Penny's pack mule. ---------------------------------[ Glance ]---------------------------------    Mike................An introverted, wild-haired academic.

Like most Americans and most geeks he has absolutely no clue of the caloric value of a double bacon cheeseburger with biggie fries and a super-sized Dr. Pepper, and devoured them like a thirteen-year-old girl reads _Tiger Beat_. Now there are just empty wrappers, vestigal shells of the carbohydrates which they once contained, and a brown plastic tray. He finished some time ago, judging from the appearance of his small and uncomfortable food-court table, but he's still sitting there writing furiously in his notebook. And writing furiously on the inside of his burger wrapper. And writing furiously on the back of his hand. And writing furiously on... whatever it is that he's doing, it seems to involve an awful lot of writing.  Hiro comes up with this little like, piece of paper, right? Not even a piece of paper - like one of those reminder notes for UPS or USPS or PSU or whatever to tell you that you missed the package, asshole, and now it's gonna take you 3 days to find it. And he's scribbled something on the back -- looks kinda like a tamigotchi's face, like one of those little keychains. Only the face is like a symbol, right? Following? And that symbol just happens to be ole Gabe, gabby, Gabriel's name. As in archangel. And these things were on TV maybe six months ago in another country and Hiro's right now just like jabbing his finger at the piece of paper. Like - what's this. Look at it. Stop lying.  "Jerking me around," Hiro accuses, loudly. Making quite a scene.  "Hey man, it was like another country, ya know?" Compton says, his voice rolling across the gravel in his throat, "Fucking Americans thing Canada is the States. It ain't ya know? Shoulda got it the first time you saw it now leave the poor kid alone." You sense Compton isn't sticking up for the McClerk as much as he's just annoyed with everything around him right now.  Mike isn't looking at the scene, but not in the same way that everybody else is not looking at the scene. Everybody else is not looking at the scene in the way that they would deliberately not see a big gray elephant in the middle of the room. Noticing the disturbance would necessitate them making some difficult social decision, like calling the cops or telling you guys to grow up and get civilized, so it's easier to just not notice anything. Mike, on the other hand, doesn't notice anything because he's so locked away inside his own head that he probably is no longer aware of the outside world existing. At least, existing in any sense beyond "the place where I write down my stuff".  "Fine, fuck, just trying to kill the days we're waiting for mr level fucking seventeen half-elf illusionist to show up." Hiro crumples the post-it note up as he abandons McJobette, hurling the scrap of paper into the garbage. Hopefully Gabriel won't take notice. "We've been here like fifteen minutes."  "Here" says Compton as he heaves the bags towards Hiro, "Go, find a place to sit. I'll get Pizza while Shoperella does her thing."  Compton. Old hand at surviving Malls. Fuck, the guy is older than the concept of Malls.  "Don't go to Dominos," and Hiro says it like he's threatening murder. Brand loyalty enslaving us and all that. Shouldering the gargantuan burden, Pigboy hop jump skip stumbles his way right to Mike's table. "Yo," he greets, before depositing the load of crap onto his table. "Nice day out." We're inside.  Mike finally takes a break from writing _War and Peace_--or whateverthehell he's doing--and stares for a moment at the burger wrapper he's littered with glyphs. He reads it, blinks a few times, scowls a moment, mutters something about utter trivial tripe, and crumples the failure up just as Hiro comes over. "Uhh." Brilliant conversation-starter, isn't it? He just looks at Hiro, blinking a few times, still holding the crumpled wrapper, desperately trying to shift mental gears into something vaguely resembling normalcy. Then--"Hi." And you know why it's been fifteen minutes? 'cause fucking Penny is taking her goddamn time. Should know better by now not to cut a woman loose in a mall if she hasn't left her bag. The one she keeps the creditcards in. This fifteen minutes will surely turn into an hour - count on it. Piggy'll remember in just a few how she couldn't put down those dumb slogan undies at Urban Outfitters until he forced her to. And at about the same time, Compton'll think "Bathroom my ass."  "Is that a tamigochi?" Hiro doesn't so much take a look at the paper as leer at it, snatch at it. Grabby bastard. Like he's gotta have it right now. Oh, and his pupils are like an animal's when your headlights hit them like right before you plow over the fucker and make roadkill burgers. Wired. Now's the time to note, when he's like a foot and loose change from your face and grabbing wildly.  Mike doesn't contest the hold on the wrapper; he just lets it go as if it's of absolutely no use whatsoever. Which, to his lights, it probably isn't; after all, it's trivial tripe, easily discarded. What's on the wrapper? Scribbled linguistic analyses of ... good lord! There's Chinese, Devanagari, hieroglyphics, an entire Comparative Linguistics thesis boiled down into tiny, terse letters and symbols. If this guy speaks all these languages, it's real puzzling that he's so lousy with English.  "HmmMmMM," Hiro spits out, like he's really pleased, interested, fascinated. So much so he crumples the wrapper up and drops it -- complete with overflow ketchup and a couple onion bits -- into Penny's bag. The one she got from that really expensive store. The stuff that's all silky and wrapped in tissue paper. "You're Mike," he accuses.  Mike shakes his head no. "My name is /called/ Mike," he answers. "My /name/ is Michael. I am neither Mike nor Michael." Okay, someone's just shown themselves to be a few flavors shy of a Fruit Loops box. He says nothing else, showing a talent for conversation that's nothing shy of autistic.  "Well the method by which I choose to identify you is Mikey Mike, or Mikeadoodleskroodle, you dig. I'm Hiro Stice. You can infer the identities and names and nicknames of my esteemed associates, right." And Pigboy here, he lays like this card out in front of you, some kind of like rave flyer, but it says THE INVISIBLE COLLEGE and it's got these numbers, names, words, ideas all over it. "Yo, call us tonight, huh? You can come by the warehouse. Meet everybody, like. We can talk shop and braid each other's hair." Mike looks up at Mike, blinking a few times as he tries to parse out these words. "Okay," he finally says, taking the flyer from Hiro and placing it into his notebook. Quietly, he gathers up his papers and tucks them in as well, then closes it all up and returns it to his satchel. "If you'll excuse me? I've got things I really must be doing." Things in Devanagari, no doubt.  "Pleasedtapleasedta, Mikey." Hiro looks back at Compton, or at least looks for him - and kinda like, forgets Mikey Mike. Not in a rude way, but in a 'walls bleeding must stare' kinda way.  Compton's booty is held low and close to his body, by his quick movements and darting eyes you get the sense that he's up to something. "There ya go. Tacos." he says as he deposits the tray on the table. No, not pizza, tacos. Easy mistake though.  "Taco bell. You fucking swine," hisses Hiro. Hiro steps through a void into the OOC Nexus. Hiro has left.  Compton shrugs and retorts a 'Yeah, whatever Piggy.' and grabs up Penny's bags and makes tracks before the Taco's owners get wise to their food whereabouts. He heads towards a La Senza boutique. May contain Penny, but if not - oh well.
