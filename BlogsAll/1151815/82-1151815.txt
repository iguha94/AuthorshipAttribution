         Interzone Records - Main Room(#1937RhJM)           Everything used to be something else, and Interzone Records used to be a bowling alley. Some traces of the original layout remain: the sunken floor, the shoe counters where the cash registers now sit, and most notably, the wide open spaces where the lanes once were, now filled with row after row of CD's and records, sorted by genre and artist.          The walls are a testament to Erin's Vale's rich history as a stop on the Pacific Northwest touring circuit. They're covered from floor to ceiling in psychedelic-inspired posters, from cracked and fading Fleetwood Mac and Pink Floyd tours, to recently-printed memorabilia from The White Stripes and The Donnas. Just as the walls are covered in posters, so the counters and record bins are plastered with stickers, in some cases several layers deep, covering the history of punk rock, from The Ramones and Stiff Little Fingers, to bands that are still practicing in the garage.          Near the counters, a small alcove has been devoted entirely to local bands, showcasing their music and littered with advertising fliers for local nightclubs, bars, music halls, and theaters - any place with a stage.          Over the sound system, there is music playing. Always.   So it's late enough to be awake but too early for four-twenty, so Hiro's actually out and about. The cops are all over the east side right now, so he's not loitering in the slums, and there's no way he'd venture into the western half of Erin's vale. So - somehow, following mention of a twenty-four hour peep show from a phone booth to a bowling alley from a flyer in the gutter to somehow ending up here: Pigboy slouches through the entrance, the strap of his record bag digging into his shoulder, face ruddy from the cold and the wind.  On your typical Wednesday afternoon, Interzone Records is a bit crowded, with plenty of high schoolers looking to spnd their hard-earned allowance money on music. A red-haired boy is standing at the counter, checking bags in exchange for playing cards. A great big middle-aged biker stands at the register, ringing up orders, while Enid stands between the aisles with an armload of CD's, returning them to their appropriate bins. The sound system plays Soul Coughing, and the yellow-haired girl sings along to "Screen Writer's Blues" while she returns Iggy Pop and BT where they belong. "It is five am," she drawls, "And you are listening to Los Angeles."  Back of a hand scrubbed across his nose. Hiro sniffs once, sharply, and balls hands up in coat pockets; slipping through a knot of teenagers clogging the entrance. Progress into the depths of the store is slow, cautious: a nervous, furtive animal searching unfamiliar territory. Past banks of CDs - beneath garish displays - through crowds of kids - then, finally, down a specific aisle, side-to-side flicker of attention, eyes darting across dust jackets and labels.  A gutterpunk - two-hundred dollar boots, shaved head, pockets full of spare change - starts to slip a CD under his jacket while Enid's back is turned. With the same sixth sense granted to teachers that allows them to decipher just who threw tha spitball, the yellow-haired girl turns around and tell him, "You're _so_ gonna put that back, 'cus I'm not gonna buy it back off of you when you bring it by next week." The gutterpunk grumbles, the CD is returned, and Enid tactfully wanders off into the electronica section, still humming just a little off-key.  And, yeah, maybe Hiro isn't totally dissapointed. Because an initially cursory examination catches, snags: Pigboy slows down as something catches his eye. Backtracks. There's a certain obsessive fugue that makes people like him distinct: he doesn't notice the erstwhile thief, the failed theft - really, everything other than the tips of his fingers and the records passing beneath them exists on a frequency he's just not tuned in to. He's hunched forward like quasimodo by the time Enid breezes through his section -- scrutinizing a release from some obscure breakbeat label.  Every major city has at least one record store like Interzone. The aisles are studded with little recommendation cards from the staff. Buy this. Buy that. So-and-so is listening to this right now and it kicks ass. The breakbeat section encompasses everything from Electro Funk to Two-Step Garage, with notes scribbled in the margins about the pros and cons of various sub-genres. "Kidneythieves," Enid says as she passes the pig-boy. "You need to pick up every Thidneythieves album ever."  Some internal filter clicks, in the way that somehow even totally zoned people can pick up that they're being addressed when they don't seem to be paying attention to shit. Hiro looks up, then back: over his shoulder, thumb to glasses, nudging them up the bridge of his nose. A flash of scrutiny - enough to fill out a police blotter - and then back to the records. "Breaks?" he asks, rotating the record right-side-up, tugging it free from its nest. Flip-around: scrutinizing the tiny print across the back. "Never heard of'm."  Enid riffles through the vinyl, returning a few more albums to their appropriate places, plucking out errant artists who have wandered from their appointed genres - a yellow-haired angel of order. "Progressive breaks, yeah. They're a band outta LA. They played here last March an' kicked ass. Packed the house."  Hiro makes a noise - something in the neighborhood of acquiescence. The record he was examining seems to have passed muster: it goes under his arm, even as his attention drifts down to the 'K's. "Big following, like?" he asks, shuffling-edging sideways towards the mentioned target. A thumb seperates a sheaf of records in half, and he lowers his head for further examination. "On the lookout, right? 'slike nobody digs breakbeats anymore."  Enid shrugs, popping a stick of gum into her mouth. She chews loudly, blowing great big pink bubbles on occasion. "Beats the hell outta bands tryin' to sound like Suicide Commando, which is all we're gettin' in Industrial these days." Chew. Pop. Sure enough, the Kidneythieves albums have staff-written recommendations all over them, written in nearly undecipherable scrawls. "Cowpunchers has a breaks night these days, so there's a local market for it, but all the good tuff's comin' outta California."  Hiro looks back, again: squints. "You gotta be scammin'," he mumbles. "There's gotta be some kinda natural law against mixin' electronic music and mechanical bulls." Pluck from amidst the records: attention shifts back, and Piggy scrutinizes the hand-written notes, attempting to decipher a meaning from the hieroglyphics. "Which one you think's the most danceable?"  Enid leans across the bin and examines the half dozen or so Kidneythieves albums available at the moment, then plucks one out of the pile and holds up aloft. "This one - Trickster. It's their first album, an' I still think it's their best one. If you want to get another one, get Zerospace, which has a bunch of good remixes on it, but if you're tryin' to introduce a dancefloor to a new band, you wanna go with the original stuff first."  "Dig," acknowledges Hiro. He looks up as the sound of heavy rain creeps up like interference behind the background music: mumbles something decidedly impolite. The album is accepted, joining the other record already under his arm. "Thanks for the tip." Pause. "You know a lot of party kids around here, any chance? We just kinda rolled into town - need crew."  The red-headed kid behind the counter flips the bird at the rain pounding on the sidewalk and simply turns the sound system up. It becomes a little more difficult to talk, but Enid simply raises her voice. Loud music is a fact of life at Interzone. "It's the usual setup. We're up to our ears in party kids. Fuck, just about every loser with a set of Technics is a DJ. But if you put up a flier in the local section," she points towards a niche near the front counter. "People'll show up."  "Yeah, and so will every narc and gangbanger with a bust quota to make or some eezy to unload." Sideways flicker of attention, then back. Flash of teeth. "Thanks for the recommendation, anyway." Index and middle finger in a broad 'V', and he's heading for the counter with his rekkids.  Enid answers Hiro's peace sign by blowing a great big pink bubble that nearly obscures her face. Pop. Then she turns and gets back to work. Over the sound system, the red-headed boy plays Johnny Cash covering Nine Inch Nails. The biker is happy. Enid is not, at least if her suggestion that the red-deaded boy's mother prefers sex with the dead is any indication.
