         Side Street       Buildings line the street on both sides. It seems this is a mix of commercial and residential zoning. There are a couple of cars that bring to term the word heaps along the side street. The average clean cut useful member of society would be scared to enter this area. That especially holds true if there were a group of young punks hanging out by their vehicle smoking pot and drinking cheap booze. What are those two doing at the end of the street? Was that the sound of glass breaking? Perhaps it is best not to linger too long in this wasteland. The thought that the Mayor was right, Urban Blight needs to be halted, comes to mind.   Contents: Eddie Obvious exits: Basketball Court   Cross Street   Large Door     So it's the afternoon and there's these kids out in the street.  It's warm and pleasant - they're talkin'trash and rolling down the street with a graffitied basketball. It makes that hollow noise echoing off the walls of the nearby tenaments. On the steps of one of those buildings, Penny's leaning into the afternoon. The building isn't important, is generic, is always  falling apart; has overflowing metal garbage cans and rats moving in and out of the shade. A cigarette, unlit, rests in the fleshy part of her thumb - a balancing act. She's casual, slouched, has the look of the perpetually stoned; half-lidded and loose-limbed. Doesn't mind the locals and they don't seem to mind her.  A new games for the kids, offered by a gold toothed interloper. But no one's playing it seems. Either the younglings' about are too young this brand of chance, or they've got street smarts enough to smell a hook. Fortunately, there's always a sucker in the bunch. No matter how small the street traffic, no matter how savvy the audience, there's always someone who thinks they can  beat the game.   When Eddie comes to a halt a building over; he's found such a mook. He's young, black, and cocky. But he's got time to learn. The cards are simple playing cards, shuffled with a shark's touch. Eddie sets up on top of a small newspaper dispenser. It's flat enough to run the grift. "Ees called, find da' queen, right." And her highness is offered up for inspection in her red hearted glory. The boy nods, sure he can finger her amongst the other two cards.  Penny knows it when she sees it. Can mark the marker in the blink of an eye. From her slouch, that particular vantage ponit between the twisted iron slats, Penny watches the newcomer reel them in. His big show seems someting exciting and new. She gets up on a higher step, the concrete crumbling below even as she moves. She pockets the cigarette, pushing her sleeves up. But it isn't good enough, the view.  And those kids? They got goin'the minute their friend laid his money down. It's all "Bullshit" this and "You're gonna lose" that. But this kid, he's got confidence. Or dumb luck. Penny's just a step, a half. Then she's there staring over the tops of their heads at the game.  "Hi," her voice sending a shiver through the line-up so that they move, almost as one, turning then stepping back.  "How ju' doin." His accent's thick, and that was more of a statement than a question. Despite the momentary pause to pass on the pleasantries, Eddie's hands never stop handling the cards. The young black kid with his crooked 'Blue Jays' hat pays no heed to P. No, he's focused on her highness as she lays down with the other two cards. Then there's movement, fast fingers shuffling the three cards between three respective spots upon the newspaper dispenser. The Brazilian doesn't need to watch what he's doing; it's second nature to him. And besides, some white girl's talking to him out of the blue.   "Come on man, yer neva gonna win, yo." The kid's pals interject. But that doesn't phase the cocky street boy's intensity. Eddie finally looks down at the mark, hands still moving. "So den, hijo, jer gonna fin' de queen, right." She's flashed up from the middle position so the boy can get his bearings again. "No problem." He says confidently, placing his five spot on the make-shift table.  The kid's pals are so right about that. He'll never win. Poor and stupid are bad odds. He's the kind of kid that'll play chicken in a shitty car down a blind alley in a few years. He'll never even see that dumpster coming. He's the kind that doesn't take advice; not even from a white girl when she says "Don't you have a tournament to practice for?" Just like the poster says. King of the Courts. April 5.  "Yeah c'mon man," one shoves. "Yeah yeah, let's go already." "Man," the third complains "this shit's old."  But they don't really move. Hard to walk away from five-maybe-ten dollars in the middle of the day. Penny still hovers, glancing from time to time from Eddie's hands to his face. She's got a look on her face while no one's paying attention to her. Like she's asking a favor. Just don't.  //.etro: Penny rolls "3" privately to Eddie at diff 5.          For a total of 1 success(es).  Dumb AND lucky.  Penny moves up again, positioning herself between the kid, his money and the game. Now that she and Eddie are facing him, he starts to tilt his head a little. He starts to lose his cool, confident intensity "Nah man that ain't right," eyeballing your jacket and hair. Your teeth and tats. He backs off with his friends catcalling "Told you man, told you." He starts to make a grab for his money. But it's already in Penny's hand. She holds it up and back, has the height advantage. "You fuck off out of here right now and stop shitting your mother's dope money away, hey?" She chucks the balled-up bill and watches him go running.  Far from satisfied, Penny profiles, lip curled "Don't they teach you not to shit where you eat?"  Golden smile turned to neutral watch. The boy's are out of sight, more important now is the girl who fucked his grift. But the cards don't stop, even though the mark's been run off. Maybe a nervous habit. Eddie keeps shuffling.   "Da' was dinner money ju' jus spooked." *flap, flip, flap,* Fingers work the trio. The queen remains hidden under cover, and Eddie's mood runs sour. He wants to see what's next, he wants to recoup that five spot, and his stomach audibly wants some McNuggets. But he's not letting on like he's sniffed her yet. Nothin' in his body language shows his hand. Dude's got one helluva poker face.  "Josiah Michael Stevens isn't your meal ticket" Penny watches the cards. Flip flip, tick tick, stab. Her thumb interrupts the flow, the pink of her nail going white with pressure of her frame behind it. Speaking from the pencil-thin lines, her mouth and eyes transformed, possessive "He's mine."  She stands there still wanting to make something of it but her eyes are a give-away, red and veiny. All bark and no bite, clearly not at the moment. She steps back and swipes at her nose "So."  So, some foreign language. "Olhe a menina, mim no sabem que tipo do modelo voc pensa que eu sou, mas eu vi o que voc apenas l. E eu no penso que engraado... ou atrativo." Whatever that means.   The card's flipped over, Penny isn't a winner. But she shoudn't feel bad, like he says. "Don' feel bad, hija." See. Eddie holds up the King of Diamonds. "Nobody wins when I play. But ju'... ju' owe Eddie a cheesburger, eh." (In Portuguese "Look girl, I don't know what kind of idiot you think I am, but I saw what you just did there. And I don't think it's funny... or cute.)  You say "How about we call it even and you go make chumps of the tourists," nodding up the block during the departure from the english language, coming back around with "y'know that way, Eddie." The name spoken like a taunt. Whatever you said it didn't register on her radar of things to get offended by and she's on a tear all  her own.  "I got a business here, shit" all pissed off "and you think you can just stealth your way in? What the fuck?"  "Business? Dat what ju' call fuckin' with those kids lil' brains, eh?" A glance towards their departing forms. With a single swipe, he's plucked up the trio and returned them to random slots in his deck. That get's lost in his valet's uniform, and patted with his grimy fingers. Somewhere a nail-clipper is missing him. Eddie's working on one hell of a coke pinky. Planting both hands on the newspaper dispenser, he leans in to speak real quiet like.   "Next time ju' fuck with Voodoo Duarte's game, ju be nice about it hija." Having said his piece, the dark dude backs and preps to bail.  Penny, too, leans in real close like and slides her hands up on the empty newspaper stand, grabs the trailing hand. Presses something into it. Smallish. Dime-ish "I know who you are," she grins white and wide "I just wanted to see for myself if it was true."  As she walks off into traffic you can hear her say "He talks about you in his sleep all the time."
