         You pull open one of the glass doors and step inside Papa's Chicken Shack. Slums - Papa's Chicken Shack(#1559RJs)          Papa's is a little different from most fast food joints as one can tell when they step through the doors. From it's employees dressed comfortably in jeans and tshirts, to the checkered plastic cloths that cover the tables in the dining area, it speaks of a family run business - the big guy in back even answers to 'Papa'. Above the counter with it's single register lies a menu board - if it can be fried, it's probably up there. Dine-in or carry-out, either way, the extra grease on the side is free!  Contents: Rusty Thomas Obvious exits: Out (O) Rusty shakes his head slowly at Thomas, and starts talking quickly between bouts of animalistic mastication, "I sleep in the woods mostly. There was this other kid who slept in a garbage bin but that's stupid. People can find you." He has a good ten - okay now six piece of chicken in front of him. Thomas doesn't seem to be eating. He sucks his fingers clean of grease, though the layer of dirt and god knows what else remains. "Plus people are scared of me."  The old man shuffles in from the street, the early spring stink of the trash thawing out in the surrounding slum wafting in with him. Digging in to his coats pockets he prodcues a collection of crumpled singles and a handful of change, obviously from a productive afternoon, and dumps it out on the counter. Tonights dinner in the planning.  Thomas seems to ponders this. Garbage bin. "Rai.", he guesses. For some reason another name pops up too, but he knows for a fact that this kid is no longer sleeping there. "But yes, of course they are.", he says, once more smiling lightly at the kid sitting in front of him, trying to choke himself on chickens. And fries. And ketchup. And ....  Rusty dumps a mound of relish in his mouth and then follows with some chicken torn off from the drumstick. He mixes it around in his mouth. He turns his head to look to Compton for a moment, but in the grand scheme of things what does some care kid about some old guy. Except to comment that he smells better than the old guy. "Man, that guy smells worse than me." Unlikely. He looks to Thomas. "So.. are you a knight or something?"  Chik'n biscuits. Combo #3 appears after Compton counts out the dollars and cents and pockets his savings. The plastic tray and paper cup of Coke and his sorry carcass settle down in to a both by the front door and tucks in.  Thomas turns to look at the man Rusty seems to indicate, before he raises an eyebrow. "I think you are about equal.", he comments, sniffling slightly, before actually scoffing at the next question. "A knight? No, certainly not.", he states in his habitual quiet voice, shaking his head. "I am just myself.", he clarifies. As the older man settles, Thomas attention seems to settle as well, back completely on the kid sittion opposite of him.  Rusty goes through eight pieces of chicken at a frightening rate and he's talking quickly. "Okay. Where did you come from?" He pauses as he's talking and then chokes on something, it could be a lot of things, in his throat. He turns and heaves, his beady eyes bulging and watering and forming a red ring. You're pretty sure something comes up because suddenly his cheeks bulge and some liquid escapes his tightly pressed lips. He blinks and then gulps back hard. Then he chokes a bit more, coughing into the floor and slipping off his seat. (OOC) Rusty says, "hehehe I hope nobody's having dinner right now" (OOC) Thomas warns he has to retreat to bed soonish. (OOC) Rusty says, "okie" (OOC) Rusty says, "Compton's next right?"  (OOC) Compton is good. (OOC) Thomas says, ".nods ;)" WEATHER REPORT: The clouds overhead begin to lower, blanketing the land in fog. Thomas seems to take a moment to consider the question, but instead is ultimately interupted as the poor kid almost barfs up all the food again. "Been eating too fast, have you?", he asks, quite simply, looking, watching the poor kid struggle with containing the contents of his stomach. Well, if he throws up, he throws up. If not, then not. "How long ago since you ate anything proper, hmm?", he wonders. No, it is not the food, nor an alien trying to break free of his chest. Calm down again. Rusty sniffs and blinks some of the water from his eyes, seeming to have gotten ahold of himself. He gulps a couple times. Climbs back onto his chair. "I.." he reaches to take a gulp of rootbeer. "I just drank my own puke." He hehehs. Then he pales. "I don't feel so good. Can I get it to go?"  Thomas nods his head. "I am sure they will pack it for you, if you ask nicely.", he says, nodding in the direction of the counter. And should Rusty indeed go to let his food be packed up, Thomas would get up, cross the floor, 'loose' a five-dollar note near the table of the older man sitting there, before slipping out, leaving the kid to return to an empty table. He would know where to find him if he really wished to, now. No need to press the charitability too far, is there?  (OOC) Thomas thankies for the RP but I am nearing keyboard face.  (OOC) Rusty says, "hehe.. thanks. Later!" Thomas goes home. Thomas has left.  Compton peers at the fiver like a scorpion on the shitter. Looking around quickly for the sting, he extends a Birkenstocked foot and drags the moolah back and under his table. Careless people. Rusty walks back to the table, pausing to let out a long belch. He furrows his brow when he sees the table's empty and gives a snort. He ambles over to Compton and kicks the back of the old guy's chair leg to get his attention. "Hey. You see where the guy I was talking to went?"  Compton puts a protective arm around his grub, and hunkers down, eyeing the street urchent warily. Over a gobfull of buscuit he manages, "Out tha door." he manages with a gravelly voice.  Rusty glowers at the door. "Oh." He squints his beady eyes at Compton and kicks his chair again. "Hey, what's your problem?"  "'m fuckin eatin." he barks, spittle and chunks of bread hit the table as if to make the point valid.   Compton did seem to be enjoying it too, taking his time. Not like some starving people... "Wot's yers?"  Rusty furrows his brow, a little taken aback. "-You- looking at me like that. Fuck. I jus' asked a fucking question.." He pauses in his muttering and glances quickly at the unhappy kitchen staff. "Quiet down, dummy."  "Settle down son." he says in a tired way, plucking another tuft of buscuit from the basket. "Yer friend dropped this.." and the $5 is dragged back out from under the table for you to see.  -------------------------[ Info Report for Rusty ]--------------------------  GENERAL INFO:         That ratty kid you see wandering the park every now and again that probably has no home. What do you know about him? Well, mostly, that he smells bad and likes to growl at inanimate objects. -----------------------------------[ - ]------------------------------------ Overhead, the sky starts to darken to amber as the sun begins its westward descent. Soon it will be full night. Rusty stoops and grabs the bill. He stuffs it in his pocket, grinning, "Thanks." He sucks on his rootbeer till it makes a gurgling sound and then discards the empty cup on the table in front of Compton. "Who're you?"  Compton chews and chews, watching you thoughtfully. Weighing the options here. Give up a name, his name... "Cash" he says eventually, offering up a calloused bony hand. Rusty furrows his brow. "Your name's Cash? Like Jonny Cash?"  "Yeah. Like Jonny Cash. Parents were fans." his tone getting a slight edge to it, like he's used to having this coversation over and over again.  "You gotta name?" COmpton asks.  Short, about 4 and a half feet tall, stocky. He has straight black hair that falls lightly over his forehead, grown over at his ears and the back of his head. His eyes are nearly all black, beady and round, the quiet sunken eyes of some carrion bird. His nose is short and pressed up on his face, and below are a pair of thin lips that pull a length across his baby-fat rounded jaws. He has a pastey complexion, as though he hasn't seen the sun. Across the left side of his forehead and disappearing into his hairline is some mottled white scar tissue.         The crumpled and sweat-yellowed collar of an oxford shirt peeks out from under a wool v-neck sweater, sleeves rolled up to accommodate his short arms. His tummy bulges over the waistline of gray slacks that have been ripped at the cuffs and knees. His hands are short and stubby with black dirt pushed up underneath every fingernail. Peeking out from underneath ragged pant cuffs are leather shoes, muddy and scuffed to all hell. Rusty nods slowly and then suddenly realizes something. He reaches to shake your hand. The half of his thumbnail is missing and seems to be leaking some yellow liquid. "Rusty." His grin is strange, a little too big. He's smelly and dirty but there's something extra about him that makes him a little extra unpleasant to be around.  Birds of a feather. Compton is spooky too. Not scary-spooky, but weird spooky. Like he's seen it all, and stands outside of the normal way of things.  He gives your hand a breif single shake and lets go. "Ya from 'round here kid?" he asks. WEATHER REPORT: The fog lifts slowly revealing an overcast sky. Rusty shrugs. "I'm not from anywhere particular. I mean, yeah I live around here..." He crawls up onto a chair across from you. "How about you?" He wipes the back of his hand across his nose, streaking a snail's trail across a cheek. It gathers above a similar streak that's crusted over. Disturbed the crust flakes and snows onto the front of his shirt.  "You, ah got some..." Compton starts, pointing to his cheek, "Something right here."  "Yeah, few blocks east of here by the old GE Plant." *munch**munch* "How old are ya kid?" Rusty turns his head to the side and starts scratching at his cheek. The light snowfall becomes a storm. He furrows his eyebrows at the old guy's question. "I dunno.. I'm pretty old. How old are you? 100?" The sun dips below the horizon in the west and the Waxing Crescent moon rises behind the clouds with the ending of the day.  Compton snorts, going for a drink of the Coke, "Not quite. So, who was yer friend? A rich mark?"  Rusty furrows his brow at Compton. "Uh yeah. Something like that, I guess." He stares down at the table and then crosses his arms tightly in front of him. His stomach makes unhappy noises and he turns his head, going pale. "You live by the GE plant? I heard it was haunted. And has monsters."  Compton perks up a bit at this, "Really? Monsters? Sez who?" This seems to amuse him some.  Rusty shrugs at Compton's interest. "Sez everybody. Like, I dunno what they look like or nothing. Just monsters. And it's haunted.. Like and the monsters know everything you're doing and where you are and they're all hairy an shit like little uh waddya call it... gremlins."  "Ya wanna see for yourself?" Compton asks, barely containing a laugh, stuffing his hole with a wing instead.  Rusty snorts at Compton's dare. "I'm not afraid of monsters. I chase away monsters alla the time." He pauses and then opens his mouth to let out a loud sickly belch except for the smell he seems to be doing better after that.  "Oh yeah?" and a chunk of breast follows the wing, "What kind? Succubi? Dybuuks?"  Compton... says. Rusty narrows his beady eyes. "Yeah.. and.. and giant spiders."
