         //.etro: It is 06:18 am, early morning, on Monday the 20. day of October, 2008. The rich aroma from Starbucks draws you in. Starbucks(#547RIJM)   Contents: Mary Jacob Obvious exits: Out      A small table by the window (#1) has 3 empty places.  A larger table by the front door (#2) has 2 empty places.  A quiet booth in the back (#3) has 6 empty places.  A table near the serving counter (#4) has 1 empty place.    Present:   Mary - Jacob   A cozy table for two (#5) has 3 empty places.  A seat at the counter (#6) has 4 empty places.  A comfortable sofa (#7) has 3 empty places.  A table at the back (#8) has 3 empty places. Jacob sits at a table talking with Mary.  Mary shakes her head a bit, at Jacob. "I know a lot of people use the line..and it probably seems like a cop out, or an exagerration, but in my case it really -is- complicated, and there isn't really anyone I can tell about it, without putting them in danger."  Jacob watches her for a moment longer then shrugs his shoulder, "I can't make you say anything, but the offer stands if you change your mind. The relief might be worth it to you."  Nobody should be here so early; not the barrista, the guy with the newspapers and least of all Penny. She ambles in, keeping her head down lest the mermaid on the wall start yelling at her; she walks in a way that paranoids consider normal, one eye over her shoulder.  Mary read your description.  Mary looks around for a moment, noting the entry of Penny. At this hour, the place isn't exactly bustling. She looks back towards Jacob, and summons up a wan smile for him. "This is corny, but the offer alone helps. Even if I can't accept it. Not right now, anyway. I think for now my only smart course of action is to keep things to msyself."          Mary Roberts is what could be termed 'a little slip of a thing'. She's  not absurdly short, but she's definately several inches below that of most  women her age, reaching only 5'3" in height. Her build is slender and reedy,  the sort that a mere breeze could well blow over, and though she doesn't seem  unhealthy, it does seem as if she could do with a little more food in her on a  regular basis. Her hair is long, reaching to about mid-back, its hue a rich  mahogany, likely her best feature, what with the highlights of red sparkling  in its tresses. Her eyes are cerulean blue, quite pretty save that there's  sometimes circles beneath them, as if she didn't get quite enough sleep.  Framed by sooty lashes, the eyes are set in a heart-shaped face, with slightly  too-pale skin.. along with lack of food and sleep, it seems perhaps she  doesn't get enough sun, though there's enough pink in her cheeks that she  doesn't look unhealthy.         Mary is dressed somewhat casually, though not to the point of  bluejeans and teeshirts. Her pants are black courderoy, comfortable looking,  though they don't seem terribly worn. They fit her well enough that it's not  out of the realm of possibility that they were tailor-made for her. She wears  a cashmere sweater in an off-white shade overtop it, the neckline slightly  scooped, though not enough to really reveal much of anything. A pair of  leather boots are worn on her feet and, when outside, a long black trenchcoat  is worn over the entire ensemble. All in all, the mode of dress is rather  conservative, with nothing revealing or suggestive about it.  Jacob nods his head a touch, "All right." moving on, "So what sort of book are the sketches for?" glancing over at the notepad in front of Mary. Mary's lips twitch again. "Horror," she says, then shakes her head. "I guess art does imitate life, doesn't it?    Mary tacks a " onto that.  Jacob quirks a bit of a smile, "So it seems. Though if it were talking rabbits and flying horses I would hate to find the parallels there."  Penny talks in whispers to the girl behind the counter. The girl, of course, can't hear or understand a word Penny says and repeats "What?" and "Huh?" and "Is that english? Parlez-vous francais?" No it isn't english, no, no and no. Penny finally grabs a 'venti' cup, points at it and mimes 'please to be filling it now.' And hardly traumatized, the half-sleeping server gets Penny her coffee.  Mary's lips twitc. "I don't think talking and rabbits and flying horses are really part of the horror genre. Unless it's a carniverous bunny, or a fanged flying horse, and even then. No... it's dark stuff. Kinda like my... uh. Like Toby Roberts' books, if you've read 'em." Which is kind of like saying the same thing about Stephen King. Only with darker themes. Jacob chuckles, "So horror is all you do then? No fields of daisies and butterfiles?" he glances over at the counter for a moment, looking at the cups that change hands before fishing in his pocket to pull out a bit of cash.  "Bunnicula," Penny butts in, adapting her tongue to english in slow syllables "bunnies with fangs." Horror, yes. Satisfied she got it right, Penny pulls her coffee off the serving counter looking for where they hid the stirry things and sugar. From that hidden area she adds "Loved your brother's work. He's no Clive Bark..er..was..um."  Silence.  Jacob glances between Penny and Mary, quirking an eyebrow as he pauses in pulling out a few dollars.  Mary looks up at Penny. "The celery stalks at midnight," she states. Then blinks at the woman, at what she adds, and forces a bit of a smile. "Still is.. if you count the post mortum publications." She then looks back at Jacob, shaking her head. "If you count what I do for myself, no. Though I'm not really the fields of daisies sort of girl."  Penny reappears from that region beyond the moon and stars, more importantly out of sight of the mermaid on the wall, brushing loose sugar-substitute from the front of her jacket. Noisey nylon swipe-swiping. "Hasat workout, post mortem" hovering over Mary's shoulder, unaware that intruding is socially unacceptable "you channel'im or somin?"  Jacob decides to aquire himself another drink, getting up from his seat and heading over to the counter for a moment, quietly asking for what he wants.  Mary goes tense just for the -briefest- of moments, though it's probably just due to the invasion of personal space. After a moment, though, she takes a breath, and forces herself to smile. "Of course not. He wrote a lot before he died.. it's pretty rough and unedited, but.. the editors want it. so I clean it up for them.. did it with a lot of his other books anyway... he hated editting."  //.etro: Penny rolls "4" privately to Mary at diff 7.          For a botch! Mary pages: Doh? :) Long distance to Mary: Penny hahs. Penny thinks you're lying when you say 'of course not' ...now a botch on that idea? I might be a little overbearing for a few minutes ;)  From afar, Mary grins. Go for it, it's all good. :)  Jacob pays for his coffee and collects it with a to-go lid. He moves back over towards Mary and offers a smile, "Its time for me to get on my way, it was a pleasure seeing you again. Take care."  "So what you're really sayin'is yeah, yeah?" She takes a seat at Mary's table, turns it around with her palm and straddles it, leans in "Does he have a lot to say? I heard when that John Edwards guy got fired from SciFi he started teaching classes on how to do it on account'a he couldn't pay his rent." She sips big from her cup, milky coffee mustache lingering "So didja like take one'a his classes after yer brother kicked it to the other side?" Starstruck, maybe. Penny rambles at an incredible speed.  Jacob stands and leaves a table near the serving counter. Jacob has departed. Jacob read your description.  Mary's looking rather uncomfortable, shooting Jacob an almost pleading look, though she doesn't ask him to stay aloud. "Uh... it was nice to talk to you," she manages. "And.. thanks. For the offer and all." She then turns back to eye Penny. "I'm not sure what you're talking about," she says, edgily. Clearly very much uncomfortable.  Jacob looks to Penny and frowns faintly, then moves to put his cup on the table between the two as he turns to Mary and says, "You've been here for some time, surely you're tired? I can walk you home on my way out if you'd like."  At your table Penny does pause. She looks out the window and then back to the tabletop "I do know," emphasis on the know part "Didn't mean to startle you or nothin' it's just it's my turn to be the mu-uh-manager of our kitchen this week." She knows what she's talking about - you might not, but she isn't overly concerned about making sense. Outwardly. "So."  Mary pauses a moment, looking at Penny searchingly, then up to Jacob. She looks a little uncertain, possibly even freaked, but she shakes her head anyway, smiling a little, even. Which is saying something, from Mary. "I'll be okay. But thanks."  Jacob pauses still, his hand resting on his cup as he offers once more, "Are you sure?" his tone implying she should be totaly before he will budge any.  At your table Mary seems to be opting not to comment on all that, at least until Jacob's left.  At your table It was a business-like "so" delivering a 'let's talk' look just  on it's heels. She looks past you for a moment at Jacob, an eyebrow arching.  Mary nods, sowly, reaching out to touch Jacob's arm, though she doesn't smile  this time. "I'm sure," she says. "Really, I am. I'll be fine.. and home, for  now, is just accross the street."  Penny looks past Mary to Jacob. It seems impossible that her eyebrow could  arch any further but it does. She smiles, too, miming Mary's gesture. Penny  even twiddles her fingers.  At your table Mary seems to have gotten that.. she's just waiting. All things  in their proper time, and all times in their proper things, or something like  that.  Jacob hmms and nods his head, moving to collect his cup and look to Penny,  commenting simply, "Play nice." before moving for the door.  Penny snorts into her coffee upon handling it again. Funny guy.  Jacob walks out into the busy world leaving the rich aroma of Starbucks behind. Jacob has left. You have just received a +recc from Jacob.  At your table Mary watches Jacob leave, shaking her head a little bit. "I wonder what he meant by that," she murmurs to herself, then turns her head slowly back, until she's peering somewhat steadily at Penny. Not to say that she isn't still unsure of all this, but at least she's able to make eye contact directly. "So," she repeats.  At your table Penny says "It's what little boys say to little girls when they've been kicked out of the club-house. Come on, Mary" Penny levels pretty quickly "A parrot you are not." She rests her chin on folded forearms across the back of the chair. Head tilted just-so.  At your table It should be pretty clear at this point that Penny's probably one of the good guys. She gives off that vibe. Or something.  At your table "Are you sure?" Mary murmurs, softly. "I could be, you know. A parrot in the shape of a girl. Stranger things have happened, you know." She's watching you closely, with the wariness of someone that's simply not used to talking about certain things to anyone. The look of someone that only has themselves to trust. Okay, so it sucks to have that luck, but hey, what can  you do? "What do you know?" she asks, suddenly. Bluntly.  John Smith comes in off the street following the rich aroma of coffee. John Smith has arrived. John Smith wanders in, rubbing his hands together to fight off the effects of the cold morning air. John Smith makes his way to the front counter and looks up at the menu, then back to the cashier, "Uh.. nope.. still just the regular."  At your table Penny acquires that look. The lucid moment. Her eyes drift toward the mural on the wall "It's listening," gestures with her chin. She sips again and offers instead "We have a lot of mutual acquaintances, you and me, a lot of people that want some very exclusive" implying something more than singular "relationships to evolve." She tilts her coffee sideways "Some for better," tilts it the other way "some for worse." These things she says are said with such calmness at their center it's impossible for them to be taken as threatening.  John Smith searchs the room hopfully while he waits. John Smith read your description.  At a table, Penny straddles a chair looking sideways every now and then. She's having some kind of very serious conversation with Mary. Some might argue that it's too early for serious conversations but there's a look on Penny's face, a posture that is impossible to mistake.  At your table Mary goes still for a moment, gaze rather intent upon Penny. -Very- intent, in point of fact. "maybe if you could give me a name, I might feel a little more... confident about furthering this. See, here's the thing. I'd really like to talk to you about this, but I don't really want to do it here. But there's some people after me, apparently. Someone willing to shell out a lot of money for folks to mess with me. So, y'know, I'm kinda wary.. can you give a name? So I know that you're on the up and up. I'm sorry if that's rude, but I'm a little freaked right now, over.... over a lot of things."  Penny goes "OH JESUS" fairly suddenly and really loud.  Mary's also looking serious, wariness and curiosity flaring through her expression as she talks to Penny, leaning forward a little, hands resting on an open sketchpad. The page has only a few lines drawn on it, nothing concrete, and the pencil has been dropped, to lay forgotten next to the pad.  John Smith starts slightly at the larger woman's exclaimation. He seems much more awake now.  John Smith glances over to see what the cause of the outburst is.  At your table "I'm such an asshole. It's this fucking dr.. " cutting herself off pretty quickly "drip. it's keeping me up nights and augh,. Shitshit. SHIT I'm so sorry." She puts her coffee down and gets up a little to turn the chair around and scoot in to the table. She grabs your hand, too. It's a shake "I'm Penny, PEN-ny. Oh I'm so sorry I thought I'd said."  Mary jumps, noticably, leaning back against her seat at the sudden exlamation from Penny, blinking at her companion, though she relaxes again as her hand is suddenly grabbed, and softer words exchanged  Penny turns her chair toward Mary, right hands clasped in some kind of handshake, speaking lower and more intently than before.  At your table "Um. I'm Mary.. I guess you already new that. Only, that's... not what I meant." She grins, and though it's brief, the expression brightens her face enough to prove that she's a little amused. "It's good to know your name, though, but what I was asking is about who the mutual uh.. acquaintances are. And you're not rude, really."  John Smith looks from one woman to the other for a moment before deciding that an intense conversation between two lesbians this early in the morning is entirely none of his business. He glances desperately at the cashier to see if his order is ready, which, in fact, it is. He pushes the change needed to pay for his coffee across the counter with his right hand while his left seeks out  a couple of napkins which he retrieves and uses to wrap around the very hot container of freshly brewed coffee.  John Smith mutters, "Not gonna do THAT twice..."  At your table Penny lets go of your hand and oh-oh-ohs, nodding "Mister B." Really that's all she'll say about that. Best to keep as much under-wraps as possible is basically always Penny's policy.  Mary would probably be absolutely mortified if she knew that such an assumption had been made about that, especially over a mere handshake and intense conversation. She's oblivious, though, and is thus saved a lot of blushing and suchwise embarrassment.  At your table Mary ohhhs, softly, and nods. "Him," she murmurs. "I'm not always sure I trust him.. but he's done an awful lot for me. Including paying the guys I just mentionned double what they'd been promised, if they'd leave me alone. So.. yeah. I guess he's a good guy. I'm just nervous of about everyone. Chalk it up to my recent career as a recluse. Um. Yeah, so I guess.. I duno. We should talk, but not here.. I don't know where, though."  John Smith plops himself down on one of the chairs near the window and opens peels open the lip of the container lid and takes a cautious sip of the steaming liquid within.  Totally understandable where J. Smith might come up with that idea. If this were San Fancisco that might be true. But it's Canada and there are stranger things here than shaved women. Penny continues to speak to Mary, mindful of her ears.  Satisfied the contents won't sear off his lips, John takes a bolder drink from the cup.  At your table Penny says "I've got a hotel room. It's pretty secure if a bit messy," she starts to get up "unless," nodding out the window "you don't think home is safe enough?" Gliding from one subject to the next without much hedging "Wouldn't trust him far as I could throw'im, good on you, 'cause it's not the people he's paying you've got to fear from."  John Smith stares out the window, watching people living out their lives, or at least struggling to get to work on time.  John Smith yawns, and stretches his arms out, revealing to no one in particular, "man... no more fuckin' nights out..."  At your table Mary's brow furrows a little bit, at that, and she starts to rise a moment later. "I've not been staying at home. I've been staying with friends, and.. well. They don't need to be dragged into this. It's bad enough I'm with them, but there was near mutiny when I threatened to leave. I have a home, but I've been away so long that I can't guarantee how safe it is, so.. let's stick with the hotel room. K?"  Mary starts to get up, about a moment after Penny does, apparently leaving with her. This surely can't be doing wonders for the false assumption about what's going on between them.  John Smith slumps forwards after his stretch, as though the act has drained him of all his energy He yawns again, trying to remove the sleep from his body with a quick shake of his head, "buhwuhuh..."  John Smith shivers to complete the action.  You stand and leave a table near the serving counter.  John Smith glances up... yep... just as he suspected.  Mary stands and leaves a table near the serving counter.  John Smith read your description.  "M'beat, let's just cab it over to my place okay?" World-weary and without any pre-empting, Penny gets the door out for Mary, leaving her cup behind for the staff to clean-up after. So efficient here, they even swipe down the mess of sugar and stirry things. Holding the door open with her booted foot, Penny zips up her jacket and amscrays. See, that's the nice thing about assumptions; generally they're never wrong.  John Smith gets that distant day-dreaming look in his eyes as he discretely (or so he thinks) watches the women leave... together.  Mary walks out of Starbucks followed by the rich aroma of fresh coffee. Mary has arrived.  "Place is a dump," nodding up across the street towards the bar "they let in anybody." She steps out toward the street and looks for that elusive early-morning cab. Everyone else is taking the subway; she looks that way, too, dismissing it with "Eva has the map."  You have just received a +recc from John Smith.  Mary follows you out to the street, still oblivious to what's been assumed. Ah, well.. ignorance is bliss, sometimes. "A cab's fine," she murmurs. "I'm a little tried, too. Not been sleeping so well, and... well. Dumps happen. It's in the eye of the beholder. Who/s Eva?"  Penny explains in the cab-ride over "Oh she's usually tour-guide but she hasn't shown her face in a while. Least not since the move here."  Mary follows inside,looking rather blank, though she seems to have decided not to ask too much more. Not just yet. Not until the safety of a room has been reached, at any rate.  Penny picks up a few things from the lobby; namely food from the breakfast buffet, some local-color pamphlets and extra coffee-packet filter things for the cheap coffee-maker in the bathroom. She stops again in front of Room 174, knocking quietly as she unlocks the door "Be decent, ladies present.." though who she's talking to is a mystery. Could be no one.  Mary enters the apartment.  Mary looks a little uncertain as Penny calls out, brow furrowing a little as she follows the other woman into the apparently empty hotel room, which she scans quickly, as if checking for such a thing. She looks back to Penny, blinking. "Checking for Eva?" she asks.  Penny laughs under her breath, something like 'eva couldn't get in here if she tried'(suggesting Eva is uncomfortably large), kicking something in a box into the closet. Hard. There's a large burn-hole in the carpet between the beds and the detrius of months of living in one room; a pile of take-out boxes in the corner, three laptops set on the desk all rigged together and a robe in dry-cleaning plastic hanging over the bathroom door. Presumable Penny's.  "Don't mind the mess."  Mary gives the linked up computers a curious look, as she makes her way over to perch herself on the edge of one of the beds. "It's not that bad," she says, trying to be kind, perhaps. "I've seen worse, anyway." She sets her bag down - having stuffed her sketchbook back into it while exiting - and looks back to you. "So... can I start by asking what Mr. Browne told you, exactly?"  Penny unwinds herself from the satchel at her side, tossing it into the headboard. She kicks off her boots on the way into the bathroom. Half-closing the door behind her, the conversation carries on slightly echoed "Like you? I trust about only half'a what he says. What I /do/ think is true" implying this is what he said "is that you have some wealthy bad-asses after you." The sound of water running is low; the sink-tap running "And they have nothing better to do with their time and money than to make you uncomfortable and unhappy because they know where you are." She comes from the bathroom minus the jacket and two-of-the-three-shirts, toweling off her face. "So tell me about him." Singular.  Mary sighs, and flops back against the bed, legs dangling over the edge. "Specify. Which 'him'? If it's Mr. Browne, I can only tell you so much, because I don't know myself. If it's who's after me... my only assumption can be that it's the person I saw murder the man I love. With a chainsaw. Or someone close to him. If it's someone else, well. I don't know. Who're we talking about.. and what did Mr. Browne tell you that you don't believe?"  "That pee eye Gabe? was your boyfriend?" the towel hanging in her hand "dang girl. Well him, that's the one." She sits on the other bed with a sudden solemnity "Nice guy," opening up the floor.  Mary sighs, softly. "I don't think he was my boyfriend. I never told him I loved him... never had the chance, though. He told me, though. It was the last thing he said to me. he was a very good man." She's staring at the ceiling, still, and adds, more quietly, "In spite of what was done to him. But.. this would be easier if I knew what you already knew. There's... things. Things I'm not supposed to talk about, though I think people who know are exempt. Only I don't know how to tell who knows. Gabe was the one that made it all make sense."  "Aw hon, he messed you up, din'ee" dropping into a drawl that seems more natural for her, for the hour. "He trusted you with his secrets - of course he was your boyfriend." Sympathetic, she nods a little "It'll make sense without him, too. You want some coffee, hon?" She gets up, needs to do something with her hands. Poking around the coffee packets, the pastries "I know all about that guy with the" she mimes the way to hold a chainsaw with her fists. "It's kin'a intense, innit.."  Mary shakes her head. "That's the thing, Penny. He didn't mess me up.. not at all. It was him dying, and the way he died.. I can't even count the number of times he saved me. And there are.. things. Things he could have done to me. to ensure his own safety. Things he should've done, but he wouldn't. Because he didn't want to mess me up." She sits up again. "Coffee would be good," she adds.  Penny looks over her shoulder, something reproachful lingering, as she heads back to the bathroom. Kicking open the door, she reveals another kind of mess. Just past her on the floor is a plastic bag, lots of hair overflowing from it. "Any man that doesn't tell me where *I* stand until the minute he dies? is in the messed-up column'a my book" Going through the motions of rinse-fill-slide-presto, coffee Penny also adds "So had you met Earl before?"  Mary smiles a little bit, just for a moment. "He was getting there," she says. "It was building. He may not have known til then.. he did say it, though." But then, the question registers, and she flinches. "Yeah," she says. "Yeah, I... had. Which makes it a bit worse, when you get right down to it. I knew who he was, and vice versa. He knows where I live. Part of why I don't trust the safety of my house."  The pop and hiss of ready-made two-cup coffee sizzles out "Prolly more than that, hon" emerging from the bathroom with some Holiday Inn-stamped mugs "guy that can come and go out of thin-air has a lot more going for him than charisma and a little black book." She hands you a coffee and takes the edge of the bed again, folding up her left leg beneath her "No such thing as too paranoid."  Mary curls her fingers around the cup, holding it in her hands. "He can do more than that. I think he can mess with people's minds.. hell, I think he messed with mine. But I know what he is. Same thing Gabe was, only... Gabe fought it with everything he had. Earl, I think, reveled in it." She takes a sip, and relaxes a bit as blessed caffeine eases down her throat. She looks over at you, and considers you. "I'm guessing you know, too. I don't think Mr. Browne would've told you about what happened, if you didn't, but I'm wondering why he told you. Hell,I'm wondering why he's helping me. He doesn't seem like the altruistic sort."  snorts into her mug the same way she did back at Starbucks. "I haven't known him that long either and I can say with complete certainty he's got his own pimped-out, gangst'agenda." Sipping just a little "Listen, you don't wanna know a guy like that too long. Won't help your reputation or your career. Got any plans? Know what you'll do next?"  Mary shrugs her shoulders. "I'll keep going. Not much else I can do, really. When you don't know where to turn, moving ahead is generally the best course of action. Beats standing still or moving backwards. I've got the comission to work on. The novel I'm working on has been put on hold, so I've got a bit of a break. Other than that? No idea. Wish I had more of a long term goal, but I guess you have to work with what you have."  Penny's disappointed. Genuinely and truly. "You're not gonna fight back?" She leans forward, sets her mug on the edges of the burned carpet. "I don't understand..." For the first time all morning, Penny looks confused. There's something else she isn't saying, some criticism keeping her lips pursed as she looks at you.  "How can I?" Mary says. "What can I do against them, besides tell people that -might- be able to do what I can't? That's why I told Gideon Browne. I don't trust the man, but he seems to access to firepower that I don't. I told him everything I knew about them, more than I'd told anyone else. I told the cops the parts they'd believe." She looks over at you, and sighs. "If I were stronger.. if I had some advantage I thought would help me, I'd do something. But I don't. The only answer I can make to what's been done is to keep goin, to not let it kill me. What would you have me do? I may not be entirely ordinary, but I have nothing to use against them. Not yet."  Penny says "Gideon Browne's firepower" mulling that one over. "He thinks he's gunning down the invisible man" incredulous to the point of disbelief ".. and that's supposed to work how? And you think so, too? Where'd you meet this g.." rubbing her temples. Taking a breath, Penny starts over "He did forget to mention how you hooked up with him."  "Chance," she replies. "He overheard me say something about being an eye witness. Unfortunately, so did a reporter, who started harrassig me and.. well.. pretty much chasing me with a camera. He offered to get me out, and I accepted. We talked.. he freaked me out pretty badly, but.. I dunno. I don't trust him, but I think he's got resources. I /know/ he's got money, given what he paid whoever was after me to leave me alone. You don't shell out two grand on a stranger if you don't have an excess of cash. I dunno. My instincts tell me he might be able to pull it off, and if he can't... well. He got himself into it. I didn't want to tell him anything, at first, but he kept insisting, and he flat out told me he knew the killer was a vampire - how, I don't know - so.. I told him what I knew." She looks over, clutching at her cup. "If you've any better suggestions, feel free to offer them. I'm doing what I can, Penny, but it's -hard-. I don't know for sure who to trust, and I don't know for sure how can help. What you do, if you were me?"  "When you run a strip joint, two grand's a flash in the pan." Maybe Mary's a smidge too innocent for the likes of Penny. "If I were you? or if I were in your situation?" There is some vast difference between the two, the distinction coming clear "If I were you, I would've asked G for a contingency plan in case his ship doesn't come in." Whatever that means. "If I were you, I would start packing. I would go underground and tell my publisher to fuck off and go to Fiji if I were you. Vampires are *crazy*."  "But I'm not you. And while I'm not in the position to throw a little static in their direction, I wouldn't run. Me? I'd make life difficult for Earl. And bone-up on my Dracula." It's a kind of smirk, but it's as true a statement as anything she's said so far.  Mary shakes her head. "I won't run. I'm a little harder to find right now than usual, and I'm not doing butkiss for the publishers. I'm doing the comission work for Mr. Ivanov, but that's it... and I met him in the daytime. I don't think he's related." She closes her eyes for a moment, and then shakes her head. "No. I won't run. I'll just be careful, and keep following my instincts. As for Mr. Browne, he's offered me more direct protection, but I haven't taken it. Instinct again. I think there might be a hidden pricetag in it." She rubs  at the back of her neck, and gulps down her coffee. "I gotta go soon, but I have a question for you, and I've been pretty candid so I think it's a fair one. Why all this? Why're you asking me this stuff, and why'd you bring me here? Why the interest?" She pauses, then adds, "Okay, so it's more than one question, but it's all related."  "It's as safe as any place and I've got a vested interest," gesturing in a circle with her fingers at the space between the beds. "Don't like running blind, I had to ask." Interrupted by a sound coming from the closet, a thump-thump "Just the pipes. Hot water pipe's in the closet." She readjusts, both feet on the floor "Look it's just my nature - have to know the full score from the horse's mouth," a pause trying not to insult "so to speak."  Mary drifts to her feet, nodding a bit. "Well.. now you do. Now you know. Don't tell anyone you don't trust completely, okay? I'm not dumb enough to ask that you don't tell anyone at all." She sets the mug down, and turns, heading for the door. "Time for me to scurry back to my hidey hole now, I think, before they send out search party on bikes or something. I think they actually might." A wan smile is tossed over her shoulder. "Thanks for the coffee."  Then, she's gone.
