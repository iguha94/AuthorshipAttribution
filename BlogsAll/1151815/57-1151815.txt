         Aftermath... So, I diddn't see any of the sabbat poses but I thought I'd leave 'em in for humor value.   Absently Chase hands over the kicker, still some red fluid to inject. "Hit that. Main line it, cabrone. We'll get... we'll get... the rest a you lot over..." Starting to get woozy, eyes close. His other nostril starts bleeding.  Wether its the sound of his name, or that scent in the air.. Dave scampers back and forth on the Dr's lap. The monkey takes the shot and injects the willing Dr, then suckles at the wound briefly. Its electrifying, the Monkey falling back onto the floor with a thump where he starts convulsing and shaking with the grin of one who is terrifyingly euphoric.  More twitching. A smirk shows Chase's coffee stained teeth even as his bloodshot eyes are closed to remain together. Something else is grabbed automatically within arm's reach, as if greedy fingers knew just where it was. A yellow pill for plain lips. "Sub... Subspactial ward. Walls." It's popped back to fend for it's self in with the gum. And duly, Chase nudges you to take more. "Crunch up, Doc. 'S final.... final piece."  Pobble kicks back, twitching and nudging the monkey with his foot. Dave doesn't seem to care, lost in some unholy caress. The empty shot is placed on a nearby surface and the last drag of the cigarette is taken down. "So. He have any chums left in the trads?"  Pobble says "P - Reaching into the ashtray, Pobble possibly continues to stare at Chase waiting for a response while thumbing out some Ash. Mixing this with the blood seeping from his palm he grabs a nearby book and trails the thin ooze over the cover in a twisting pattern. It's not terribly viscous so this takes a while, but Chase is otherwise occupied so.. Once the pictogram is complete its not even really recognizable, just a smear. Still. The chemicals in his head elevate the illusion somewhat and he mouths a single word in a language Chase doesn't understand. "Walls." says the Dr, in Enochian.  A - Mind 1. Shield. T - The image and the word, reverberate inside the psyche of the Dr, dragging along the psychotropic drug effects and twisting them into upperplane clouds across the subconscious. Blocking the mind from outside influences as a thunderstorm blocks the sun. Not terribly accurate or stylish, but perhaps worth the effort."  //.etro: Pobble rolls "arete" at diff 3          For a total of 1 success(es). //.etro: Pobble rolls "arete" at diff 3          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s). //.etro: Pobble rolls "arete" at diff 3          For a total of 2 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Dr Steve leans forward and inexplicably licks the markings off the book before settling back once more with a somewhat perplexed smile and once more nuding the monkey with his foot.  Chase is still in the zone, eyes closed tight like they were keeping out bright sunlight. *Pop* Chewing in the same robotic pace. "Yeahhh. Right. Just under there." That didn't answer the Doc's question very well, but it's all he could muster at the moment.   P - Chase stands languidly, pushing himself up with lazy effort. His red eyes finally opens and he takes this moment to adjust his nuts. A look about the room, he's nodding something to himself. A canister is grabbed from the chem tins, looks akin to a smoke grenade. It's walked to the center of the room and the pin is pulled whilst Chase scratches his scalp. The faint smell of oranges start to permeate the air as a colorless gas leaks out.   Cor 4 (remove room from the spacial continuum for a duration.)   T - The gas is a conduit for the Cor foci Chase has already ingested, it's gonna draw his avatar out into the air, and dislocate this room from the rest of the world, creating their own special pocket of reality."

From Derelict Home - Main Room, Darjim slips into the shadows, obsuring himself from others sight and mind. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Darjim has left. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Takes a few steps into the shadows, and doesnt seem to step back out... From Derelict Home - Main Room, Micah has left. From Derelict Home - Main Room, You all manage to arrive inside the derelict home rather easily. It seems someone has left the door unlocked. It doesn't look like anyone's at home just now. From Derelict Home - Main Room, It all seems too easy, doesn't it? Vulture voices his opinion as he pulls a pair of knives from within the long folds of his hakama. They're a pair of wicked looking devices, "Feels like a trap." The Birdman mutters under his breath as he follows the group. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Dean is unseen for all intents and purposes, not here, nah uh. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Darjim has arrived. From Derelict Home - Main Room, There is a rustle, and the sound of footsteps as Micah steps out from the shadows... From Derelict Home - Main Room, Micah has arrived. From Derelict Home - Main Room, Karl has left.
