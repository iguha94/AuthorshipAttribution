Contents: Ian Obvious exits: Old Bank Building    York Quay    West    East      The snow falls heavily, and cars stay off the streets. The blanket of white and the swirling flurries keep most folk safely indoors. In the haze of flakes that is the lighted area of a streetlamp however, stands a solitary figure. Black full length coat drawn up with a large hood, gradually succumbing to the ice and snow and transmogrifying into snowmanform. Smoke whips about amidst the white, as the last of a cigarette is spat out from the shadows of the man's headcovering.   Ian emerges from the Eclipse Corp building, his polished shoes trudging through the freezing slush outside. Turning to check the door, he rattles the handle before glancing over his shoulder. Noticing the solitary figure highlighted by the lamp, he looks to either side. Perking a brow, the streets seem vacant other than the two, the weather and hour forcing most in. Slipping his hands in his pockets, he crosses the street to approach the stranger. "Good evening. Awfully cold out here, you need anything?" he inquires politely as he causally closes the distance.   The man turns sharply, as if only imagining a voice formed from the tide and whipping wind. The motion allows a vague notion of his features. Lines of the tattoos stark against the pale skin. A wry smile, "Indubidably. There are many things I need. That however, is not the issue." A pause, the white holes where his eyes should be staring vacant, giving up nothing to the moment. "What is it that you need?"            From broad shoulders to sturdy legs, Ian's powerful physique is obvious. Standing just below six feet, his bulky frame is composed entirely of thick, sinewy muscle. Despite his size, Ian doesn't exhibit the clumsiness most associate with larger individuals. Yet, his callused hands, coupled with a healthy tan and weathered cheeks, speak of a rigorous existence. Dark hair, kept short in a contemporary style, frames his rough features. A square chin completes the outline, lending his face a certain authority. Thin lips, usually drawn in a neutral line, rest below a slightly bent nose. Impassive, gray eyes complete his stoic image.           Clad in an urban-contemporary ensemble, Ian is wearing a black suit over a French blue dress shirt and dark tie. The black, all-wool suit features a four-button, non-vented jacket and double-pleated pant. Beneath his black jacket, the finely woven cotton fabric of his blue shirt provides a pleasing contrast, making the suit look slightly less formal. His silk tie, featuring an alternating pattern of navy blue, silver, and black, is tacked in place with a bone tiepin shaped into a small rapier. His wrists are likewise adorned with bone cuff links featuring a Celtic raven pattern. A pair of black leather, cap-toe shoes complete his cosmopolitan look.           His languid movements and impassive countenance create a suggestion of indifferent. Even his powerful frame is made less imposing by a relaxed stature. Despite his apparent blase, Ian's eyes manage to appear alert and attentive, though his gaze causally drifts about.    Halting a few feet away, Ian steps into the thick snow concealing the sidewalk. Tilting his head curiously, he adds with a smirk, "A warm meal and some dry shoes, but I'll settle for information." Glancing back at the building, he inquires, "Firstly, why in the Hell are you standing out here, in this frigid weather? Of course, it is a public sidewalk, in all, but I'm just curious." His posture remains non-threatening as he chats in a conversational tone.  Those eyes stare out blankly, given the redness around them from the cold and the sheen of sleet that clings to his face, they could in fact be cataracts for all anyone knows. Unsettling how he appears to be looking at you, but could not be at all. "Waiting." says the man, quietly enough for the word to be almost lost in the shriek of the wind. Said wind pushes in the side of his hood, smacking the wet fabric against his cheek. This only causes his smile to widen. "You're missing something."   Ian squints against the bitting wind, his short hair waving against the gust. Noticing the ice that clings to the man, he remarks in a dry tone, "It looks like you've been waiting for a while." Raising his voice against the howl, he stands firm as he air whips his jacket about, kicking up sheets of snow and ice. "I'm always missing something, sir. Do you know of anything in particular?" his tone is firm, the extra volume required to convey his message in the weather.   While terrifyingly cold, and shivering slightly the man seems mentally sharp. Wired. The smile fades, an overly blank look replacing it as he stares in your direction. The hood rustles, snow falling off it as he shakes his head somberly. Ice cracks as the man unplants his frozen shoes from the ground and begins to turn away.  "You are not ready. Time will come." and he turns away, tromping off into the snow.    Ian remains motionless as the man brushes by. Blinking at the cryptic missive, he turns to regard the strange man as he trudges against the snow. Glancing back to the ground, he regards the ice imprints on the ground with a dubious look.  The imprints of work duty soles slowly become obscured by the falling snow as the man tromps on with slow and deliberate steps. Not another word or backwards glance, as he slowly dissapears into the whirling haze.
