         ***Okay. A scene with Penny, Tiziano and Compton. Just a improv home invasion dealie that turns in to a attempted double hommicide. Unfortunatly it broke down in to a 4 hour timestop due to some rather over-assumptive RP.I've left in the OOC banter although it breaks up the scene messily, I thnk it needs to be recorded what we went through and how simplistically Tiziano reasoned. We should steer clear of him in the future to avoid OOC messes like this. Oh, and lobbed bagels do not an enchantment make!***  A taxi pulls up and Compton gets out.  //.etro: It is 04:28 am, the dead of night, on Tuesday the 23. day of September, 2008.  Compton climbs out of his cab in front of the Holliady Inn. He looks like death warmed over, or that he slept in a dumpster for a few hours. _________________________  //.etro: Toronto by Night _________________________ Name          Sex Mode    Idle  Type  Short Description ______________________________________________________________________________  Charice        F   IC      1m   Pl    - Allen          M   IC      3m   Pl    - POLICE LINE - Wn   -       -    Obj   - Compton        M   IC      1s   Pl    Middle aged guy wearing a hawiian shirt. ______________________________________________________________________________   There is a police line around the Whiskey Saigon and a sign on the door that reads: "CLOSED UNTIL FURTHUR NOTICE".  Allen's hand falls back to his side as he gives Charice one more appraising look, lips still curled into an amused little grin. The two stand off down the sidewalk a bit from the Whiskey Saigon. "Could be fun to try, but I'll pass on payin'." he says, dark eyes glittering with amusement.  Charice reaches out to take Allen's left hand in her right one, cooing softly at him, "Awww sugar, aren't I worth a bit of money. If I don't bring some cash home my pimp womps on my ass. You don't want that...do ya?" smiling at the man and letting her duster fall to her elbows, showing much more then before.  As the cab pulls away, Compton staggers for a few feet towards the Hotel, before giving up and sitting on the curb, holding his head in his hands.  Allen chuckles softly, but doesn't resist his hand being taken. He lets that little ploy work, seemingly swayed a bit as he looks at the revealed skin. "I doubt I'm the only one you'd find tonight." he replies, grinning crookedly. "Depends on if you'd rather have fun, or make a buck."  Charice looks over her shoulder at Compton for a moment, as if debating something in her head. She looks back to Allen and rubs her finger over his hand gently, "You're the first John tonight and probably for the rest of the night sugar. So either you pay or I go across the street and flirt with him." motioning over at Compton.  Allen laughs at that, amused and following Charice's gaze towards Compton. "Him? I doubt he'd keep you amused for ten minutes.." he shakes his head almost sadly, "But if you want to waste yer time on the attempt.." he chuckles and flashes a toothy grin. "Or you can take a chance... never know."  Penny has arrived.  Allen is standing off to the side of the street maybe half a block from the Whiskey. Standing rather close to Charice and engaged in conversation with her it would seem, she holding one of his hands in hers.  Compton is sitting on the curb where the cab dropped him off out front of the Hotel. He's cradeling his head in his hands. Looking kind of rough, and from the smell, he's been sleeping in a dumpster.  Charice looks between Allen and Compton and says, "I don't know, he's looking more and more attractive right now. And chances only get this whore a black eye and out fifty bucks...so you either pay me for my time or I move my ass elsewhere, sugar."  Penny is walking because it's 5am and that's what she does. She walks and hums to herself and maybe there's a downbeat to her step. Could be she's plugged into something that makes her walk that way. Thump-chucka, thump thump-chucka. Penny's still bobbing her head when she steps on Compton's foot. Really it was an accident. "Old man," over-doing it on the volume it's a kind of greeting.  Allen laughs, "Allright, you've got a deal. Fifty, maybe a tip if you're a good girl." his lips quirked in an impish little grin as he stands there before the taller woman. At least with that footwear, she's got a good two inches or more on him, though he doensn't seem to be aware of that. Except maybe for the fact that certain things are closer to eye level. Charice grins, "I assure you good is too weak of a word for what I am. Come on and let me show you heaven. You wanna ride on the back of my bike?" Tugging him along as she heads over to the Harley near Whiskey Saigon.  Compton flinches with the sudden outburst so close to his abused head. His mellon wobbles in its precarious pearch on his shoulders, and he looks up at the woman standing on his foot, "Fuck... Penny." he says after a second of recognition kicks in, "Shhhhhh." is all he can say in after thought.  Allen steps away from the wall, stepping up next to Charice. "You sure that thing'll last the trip?" he asks curiously, "Sounded kinda iffy on the way in."   Charice chuckles slightly, "The guy I had fixing my bike for blow jobs ran off on me...don't worry though, she's reliable. Get us back to my pad in no time, long as you don't mind riding on the back. No one drives my hog." Grabbing the helmet and offering it to him first. Slipping on her driving gloves and doing up hre duster.  Allen waves off the proffered helmet, not seeming to be overly concerned. "Must not have been very good blowjobs then." he says as he waits for her to mount the bike, then swings up on the back of the seat and drapes an arm around her waist.  "Y'r.." she starts but the old man says quiet so she's quiet. But not her headphones. They're still spouting a static thrum, a humming drum and she's smiling. Smiling so big and so wide, crouching down behind Compton, Penny makes a face. Quiet as a mouse.  Charice snorts at the man on the back of her bike, "Naw, the guy was too whimpy for me. Didn't like being tied up." Slipping her helmet on and reving up her bike before moving the kickstand, "Let's haul ass!"  Penny mutters to Compton, "Fucking... Did you see it?" Penny mutters "Fucking strange. Did you see it?"  "Yeah, yeah of cource I saw it.... Saw what exactly." Compton asks from his stupor.  Charice walks east along King to University. Charice has left. Allen walks east along King to University. Allen has left.  Penny says, "She had fucking HORNS man. HORNS. S'fucked up, man." Not that anything can really bother Penny. She rolls and it's all good "So's your stink. S'up with that? You gone dumpster diving again?"  "Right.... horns. yeah." Compton continues in a daze. "Dunno. Woke up in one. Was with Jes at the peelers... then..." his voice dies off as his forehead krinkels up on concentration, which visibly pains him.       The sound of bumper cars fill the air of Toronto's central bar area. Dim light-gray pattern webs sullenly sway from the barely perceived buildings. If you listen closely you may hear carousel music from the location of Whiskey Saigon. Chaotic sounds of pinball machines ping from Dirk Gently's. Clicking noises like those of a railroad track are heard from the Power Bar. The familiar web covered vehicles crawl by. A reddish stain, like some sluggish invading flood, creeps across the ground of the area covering everything in its way. The pattern spiders appear to be avoiding coming anywhere near the spreading stain.       Penny scoots over on the curb and plants her ass there. The cold doesn't seem to hinder her bounce; hasn't come down yet. "You didn't do that thing with him where you bet and he wins, did you.. y'know you shouldn't play with Jesse. He always wins." Little contemplative, she stucks on the wires of her headphones, winds her fingers up in them "Seriously. Never seen him miss a mark. So what happened?"  Compton grinds a hand in to one of his eyeballs. trying to abrasivly remote a bender cataract, "Beats me. Last thing I remeber is going in to a booth with this sweet sweet ripper. Jes was talking to another girl about the meaning of reality I think. Dumbass."  Compton plucks at his Don Ho classic and takes a wiff, instantly regretting it. "Holy shit." is all he can say.  Penny nngs and gets up a little off the curb, adjusts and resettles herself. You could say she's feeling sympathy. Or something. "Really. They have the raw sweet and the dirty sweet, too. Met a few tonight. Consider another setting. The alley isn't suitable anymore. This isn't San Francisco."  And then she adds "You didn't get ripped off, did you."  Compton's head is just bobbing in that non-comittal 'yeah I'm listening' kind of way. But the pained look on his face says he's trying hard to understand the words you are forcing in to his spongy brain. After a long second, his grey matter catches up to the back log, and he reacts to your question, reaching around to his ass and poking for his wallet. "Yeah. Still got my stuff." then pokes his left cheek a few times with his hand, "Don't think it was the girl. I think someone suckered me... Bouncer. Yeah. Was the fucking bouncer!" he says, his voice rising as the memorys get kicked out of the smoldering ash of his brain. The fog's started to roll in. Weird weather they have here; and it's not a soup-to-nuts kind of fog, not that thick road-to-Berkeley fog either. It's a fog like hairspray that refuses to stay put. Penny reaches into the air and pulls at it a few times. "Isn't thick enough to write in," half smiling "I was gonna tell it to make you smell pretty."  And that other noise, that's her feet. She hasn't really stopped moving, can't sit still. Can't help the tick. "She had horns. Pale sticky halo, too. Where'd'you think horns come from?" She asks this and when she asks she sounds like a child asking about babies.  "Maybe she can't sing?" Compton deadpans.  With a grunt, some squeaking at the knees and much effort, Compton hauls himself to his feet, swaying slightly,"I honeslty have no fucking idea what you're talking about toots." he says. "I need a shower." No shit sherlock, but admitting it is the first step.  Penny tilts her head to the side, ear bud slipping out emitting the noise of some remix. Hard beats. Thirty revolutions per minute. "Maybe she stepped on a crack." She reaches her hands up. Up. Up. Pull her up. "I saw her. When you told me to shush, I shushed and Looked."   "Technically it's not work. Not if I enjoy it. Right?"  Compton peers at you for a second, like you're out of your fucking mind, then with a sigh, bends over again, his joints protesting. Grabs a hold of your wrists and leans back, trying hard to stay upright.  You say, "You mean the whore?"  Her knees crack, too. Whatever she was doing tonight, it was hell on her joints. "Yes, her. She's gonna eat that boy I bet. I'da but that's not my job this week. M'not allowed," eye drooping down, twisting sideways. "This not working shit blows. Hotel?"  Compton simply nods and turns Holiday way, "So, ya'd eat 'em eh?" he says.  Walking is slow going. Walking pace is set by Penny because that is how it works this week. "Yes, I would. If I were a girl. Freya, though, she's a bitch and a half to handle. Makes me all," pulsing her hand open and closed, open, closed like people do with stressballs "hungry. Famished. Like I'm fasting from the ebb and flow. I donno."  "Ya can raid the continental breakfast bar on the way up." Compton offers, moving none too quickly himself, "This whole Days thing just fucks me up. Not good with roles... not good with responsibility. Someday one of you are going to give me the shit, and I'm gonna fuck it up, I tell ya."  Penny enters the Holiday Inn lobby area. Penny has left.  Holiday Inn(#2848RnAJ)       This spacious lobby area has many comfortable seats and a fire place. It is very clean, except for the clutter of baggages placed on the floor by the people checking in or out. Loads of magazines are organized on a centrally located coffee table. The front desk has a couple of employees signing in guests. A gift shop entrance is located right next to the front desk area, displaying all sorts of Ontario and Canada goodies for the passing tourist to purchase. A large area opens up through a passage way on the far side of the lobby and the faint scent of chlorine drfits in from a heated pool out of sight.

"You couldn't fuck it up. There's no such thing," all matter-of-fact and absoposilutely, nodding along to a song she can only half hear. Guitars now. Wailing vocals. Johnny Cash. "Just as there is no such thing as coincidence. It's all connected. It's all good."  She knocks on the door to a room. It's not our room. She still knocks. Penny knocks on the door marked #158. Penny knocks on the door marked #156.  Tiziano leaves an apartment. Tiziano has arrived.  Compton is standing outside Room 159 with Penny. At the room that isn't theirs where Penny is talking to the door, saying things like "He's probably passed out. He probably got one look at himself in that sailor moo.." when the door opens. No one there to greet her at eye-level, she looks down.  The door opens up and Tiziano pokes out his head looking about. He is dressed as if he has just gotten up and out of bed looking over towards the woman then man, "Hey I remember you.." he trails off, "What are you doing here?"  "Candygram." Compton deadpans.  Penny looks at Compton. He doesn't have candy. He has croissants and stale bagels in a basket with those little brown stirry things for coffee. And about fifty packets of sugar. totally unapologetic, and even a little 'up' for the hour, Penny goes on like this is totally normal. "I need coffee for that little coffeemate thing in the bathroom. You using yours?" A pause, looks at the old (very smelly) man "You know kids?"  Compton closes one eye and peers at the partched Tranny from the other, "Taint funny man." he says. The to Tiziano, "Well, do ya?"  Tiziano blinks a few times before rubbing his eyes, "Do I what?" he looks between both of you wrinkling his nose.. what is it that you want?"  Penny jerks her thumb that-a-way, indicating where most bathrooms are in the rooms here "The coffee, the *coffee* we want the little coffee packets for the little coffee pot in the little coffee kit in the little bathroom set little boy. We came for the coffee. Do you have the coffee? If you don't have the coffee we will seek the coffee elsewhere." (**Note: 1 word, used 9 times in 1 pose**)  Compton says "Coffee." one more time for good measure.  Penny sighs to Compton and asides "This is beginning to feel like work. I'm coming down."  Tiziano frowns looking over towards Penny his hands being placed on his hips looking rather cross, "I am not a little boy." the high pitched voice states, "I'm 13.." he trails off, "Did you put the stuff in the punch there?"  "No." Compton says flatly, a little too quickly, "Want a bagle?"  Tiziano tilts his head a little, "Okay.." he trails off, "Antigone took my punch before I could finish it." he sighs looking over to Penny, "I'm not sure there is coffee I don't drink any."  Compton looks to Penny, "That sounded like a yes to me." he says handing the bagle over. Did we mention that Compton smells like a dumpster? Long story, but he does.  Penny looks down her nose at Tiziano, glasses slipping a little bit further while Compton tries to interject "Listen, you're getting a life-lesson little boy. Right fucking now," the build-up to this next bit bracketed by a pregnant pause and some half-hearted finger-pointing "Don't *ever* waste good drugs on the non-paying."  "What do you mean? There's always coffee. Why're you stalling? Comp - why's he stalling.."  Tiziano takes the baggle sniffing at it a few moments seeing if it smells as it should be tossed out, "Stalling?" he bites his lips, "I bet you have whatever it was that was in the punch.. umm what was the name again." he scratches his head.  "Just go *in* there and get it." Compton points past Tiziano, in to the room, "He said yes already." he reasons with Penny. Then to Tiziano, "That's good advice kid."  Tiziano quickly shakes his head, "You can't go inside my room.." he trals off, "My father would be really upset." he sighs taking a bite of the bagel talking with a full mouth, "You really shouldn't just knock on people's rooms you know."  A moment later, a light sparks deep behind Comptons eyes, "Hey kid, your parents use their mini-bar at all?"  "It's better than just walking in." Compton points out. "At least this gives you a chance to get your pants on."  Penny is leading. Compton is distracting with the bagel and Penny is walking past the kid into that room that is not theirs to hunt down the instant coffee. This only works because Compton can follow, follow-up and fix their own minibar woes as well. "C'mon, it'll just take a sec."  Tiziano turns a little red stepping behind the door, "I'm wearing shorts and I was asleep so there.. and well I I don't know.." he falls silent staring at you now the bagel forgotten.  Tiziano blinks, "Hey get out of there." he stomps his goot on the ground, "Your starting to really upset me." he grits his teeth, "Get out of my room!" he screams this last part.  Compton pushes in behind Penny, "Common kid. You said yourself you're not using it when she asked, that's the same as saying yes. You can't play with us like that... she really needs her coffee."  There's rummaging going on in the bathroom, the door half-open. These people, whoever they are, work FAST. Steamroller, baby. "Hey, you got a *showercap* Wooow. That's cool. Hey C - they got any gin left? We're gonna need it - and that shitty rum, too." She reappears, three coffee bags in her corner, when the tantrum starts "Comp - give the kid some money, hey? Bagels don't work like they used to."  Tiziano growls muttering something into Italian for a few moments looking more and more angered, "Vost grab my father's blade I'm tired of being nice." he turns towards Compton giving him a dark look, "You take one step toward me and you will die before the hour passess."  Compton puts his little 'tisket' basket down by the door and shoves a hand in to hispocket, comming out with a $5 bill. "Here kid. That's fair." He insists as he heads for the mini-fridge by the TV.  That stops Compton in his tracks. Damn. Somthing about someone half his size dropping a treat like that makes one take pause and consider it, and current circumstances a little more closely. "Hey. S'cool." the old hipster assures.  You say, "Just borrowin the freebies the hotel gives up, like you said we could."  Penny stops there, a few feet from Tiziano and kinda stares "Uu..uu.uhm. Kid listen, we're uh.. we're gonna GO. Now, okay?" Edges that way, to the far wall giving Compton a 'what the fuck' look.  Tiziano looks over towards the man, "I told you to depart.." his words drip of venom as he makes his way though the room over towards his bed he coups down as if picking something up, "No.. your going to stay.. I'm not a KID!" he screams, "I've tried being nice.. ooooh but you don't want that. You want the darkness well now your going to deal with it."  Compton gives the old eye-motion-to-the-door and a short nod, "Yeah, hey. No worries buddy. Thanks for helpin us out." and does the ole backwards march to the door, stooping to pick up the basket on his way by.  You say, "You really should use that peep hole." Compton adds in way of friendly advice still inching towards the door."  Tiziano takes a deep breath, "Oh.... now I think I am really mad." he grows silent for a moment looking towards the Bagel for a moment before tossing it towards Compton, "Catch."  That quick grab motion also pertains to Penny. Compton grabs her by the seat of her pants a little too hard. She drops the coffee packets and whines about it on the way out. "Hey, what's the big deal? It's just coffee..."  Penny stumbles backwards and catches the bagel in the eye "Ow, shit! Hey! Fuck, that fucking little ..what the fuck, Comp?"  Compton, not graced with youth, small nimble hands or any degree of dexterity, does his best with the lobbed bagel, and...  //.etro: Compton rolls "athletics+dexterity" at diff 6          For a botch!  ...not only misses the bagel completely, drops his basket and himself in the door way.  >  //.etro: Penny rolls "athletics+dexterity" at diff 6          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Nimble, young and a little rocked. That's what you have to be to get it done and get it done right. Penny is all that and a gymnast, too. She not only manages to get her balance back, but she tumbles backward and catches that fucking bagel on its way down. That was amazing.  It's not nice, but she pegs that hockey puck back into the room "Keep your fucking coffee."  Vost has arrived. Tiziano drops Vost.  Vost(#6152VXpC) See +flook  "Fucking hell." he comments to himself. Looking around behind himself for Penny. (OOC> Tiziano says "You guys brought in to the whole happy friendly Changeling bs. Its not true. It's a very dark game depending on what Lecagy your char is on. Mine is on his dark one. You barged into his room, you didn't leave when he asked you to, and he had his servent draw a very dangerous weapon. He is POed. Right now he can't even be directly attacked by Fae. (not sure about non-enchanted.) That is why I offered the retcon. I don't have humanity my char isn't human."  (OOC> Penny is just asking - we left when you threatened us and you're still attacking. (OOC> Compton never assumed nothing about Changeling. Please don't assume on my assumptions. It never crossed my path before. I'm just trying to learn how this is happening, that that it can happen. (OOC> Tiziano says "Well actully I was just attacking you at first. Compton kept calling me a kid so I tossed him in just before you left. Vost was about to smack you with his sword and inact is enchantment rede so you could see him. Quite frankly he could have walked behind you for 10 yards then smacked and killed you when you went to sleep." //.etro: Mercutio will be joining your location. Mercutio has arrived. (OOC> Mercutio says "Okay. What's up? :-)" (OOC> Tiziano says "Vost is about to attack Penny who is in the Hall." (OOC> Compton says "Oh, you know. Petty home invasion.

(OOC> Tiziano says "I.E them asking me what I had done." (OOC> Penny sends it. (OOC> Mercutio doesn't have the logs yet.

OOC> Compton says "Alright." Penny has left. Penny enters an apartment. OOC> Compton hangs for any poses. OOC> Mercutio says "Err.. waitwait.." Penny leaves an apartment. Penny has arrived. OOC> Penny says "er.. did you mean literally or what.." OOC> Penny grins. OOC> Mercutio says "Let him pose, if he wants. Then you can leave, IC."  Tiziano is on the verge of ordering the strike. He seems to think better of it falling into a deep depression instead. The anger fades away from his eyes falling on the offering basket Compton dropped on his way out. The offering seems to apease the boy.  Penny makes with the oofs and the groaning alongside the most creative use of expletices in the latin language anyone's ever heard of. If they speak the language, that is. Not as heavy on her feet, Penny moves around Compton, glaring "Aren't you supposed to be taking care of me? Hellooo.. mcfly.." she actually makes another huffing noise getting Compton to his feet. expletives, too.  Compton scambles up to his feet, using Penny as leverage, "Geezus girl. Make tracks" he orders, at the time the best he can do towards fulfilling his role as Sunday.  Penny knocks on the door marked #174. Penny shouts, "Bitches, let us the fuck in, we lost our keys." Penny bangs on the door really loudly. Like end-of-the-world loud. It's the only way to wake up the occupants.    Mercutio goes now. Mercutio goes home. Mercutio has left.  Tiziano does make his way over towards the Hotel phone. Someone does have to pay for the minibar drinks and it isn't comming out of his butt.  Penny has left. Penny enters an apartment.  Compton hauls his mass up the hall catching up with Penny, turning to look back at the room they came from. He says in huffed breaths "What. Thefuck. Was. That?"  Jesse leaves an apartment. Jesse has arrived.  Penny leaves an apartment. Penny has arrived.  Tiziano is actully in room159 though the door is wide open. //.etro: Mercutio will be joining your location. Mercutio has arrived. Guard wanders down the hallway.  Tiziano is really in his room sitting on his bed on the hotel phone.  Compton looks at Jesse, his face flushed, and he well, stinks. Like a dumpster. Long story.  Jesse emerges headfirst from the room, responding to the apocalyptic knocks with insctinct-borne alacrity. Topless, his gaunt form is a writhing mess of tattoos. Sleep is rapidly being blinked from his eyes and, even barefoot and beltless, he has his satchel clutched in one hand.  Guard continues meandering on down the hallway. He notices the people collected outside of one of the rooms.  Penny looks over her shoulder, squinting down the hallway. Not for long, though. "Not that kind of emergency," dismissing Jesse's bag "No keys, man. It's cool, baby, it's cool. I need some sleep."  Compton clutched Jesse by the shoulder and turns his dazed form back towards the room. "Go t'bed man." he offers.  Jesse has his baseball cap on. Strange but true. No shirt, no shoes, just jeans and a baseball cap. A satchel and lots of tattoos. He slumps in the doorframe, sighing, then kicks the door open with the heel of his foot and motions 'after you'. "Crazy new invention I'll have to show you one of these days. Called a fucking telephone. Lets you wake me up without banging like it's the end of the world. What will they think of next?"  "Hey!" ejactulates the fat, old guard. "You guys need to be quieter, eh? What's all this ruckus aboot?"  Penny waves to the fat guy "Lost my keys," she say, separating her words with uncalled for annunciation and ducks into their room "sorry for the noise, sir. G'night." Nevermind that it's morning. pose.  Compton tunrs and looks at the old guard, lets go of Jesse's arm and raises his in a classic, 'huh?' pose.  Penny has left. Penny enters an apartment.  "Sorry, sir, sorry." Brim pulled low over his face, the barechested wastrel waves to the guard. "Won't happen again." He ducks into the apartment.  Guard says, "Uh, hey, excuse me, eh? I'm not done talking with you folks."  Compton just stands there looking blank and airy, "Huh?" he asks this time. If it wasn't mentioned before, he stinks. Dumpster like.  Guard points over to another room, one with the door still open. "You break into that there room and steal something from it, eh?"  Jesse shakes his head no, grabs Compton, and pulls him roomward. "In the shower. What did you, find some stink you liked and roll in it?" Jesse looks down the hallway at the open door and shrugs. "I was sleeping. But why, there something missing?"  "Sorry sir, I don't know what you're talking about. I was just dropping off the lady." Compton says pointing to room 172 as if to illustrate.  Guard nods, putting one hand on his belt and the other over his collapsible baton. "Why, someone in that there room claims you pushed past him and stole stuff from the mini-bar."  Compton stares blankly at the guard again. Scared? Clueless? It's hard to tell. He opens his mouth once, but closes it again... a little goldfish like.  "Uh. I didn't do anything but wake up and let my friend back in her room." Jesse bares a wide yawn, utterly unflapped. Nothing to worry about, this misunderstanding could not be more trivial. "You sure it's them as did it?" He turns to Compton. "Did you barge in somewhere? Steal something?"  Guard just nods. "Kid described them. Said one of 'em smelled like trash, eh. This guy here, he smells aboot like trash."  Compton blinks! looking dumbfoundedly at Jesse, "Wha?" then back at the guard, "L-like I said, I was just leavin eh? Just got here too, now I'm just leaving. Shower time. At home. Far from here." Okay, he's kind of stammering.  Compton mutters to Jesse, "... the... stop... I'm... here." You whisper "Go the fuck back inside and stop talking to me. I'm SOnny, and I'm outta here." to Jesse.  "Kid?" Jesse laughs, shaking his head. "Oh, I get it. Kid hears all this, hears us being loud, figures it's a good time to raid the minibar." He waves to the Guard, extricating himself from the doorframe. "Check under the mattress. Kids always think you'll never look there."  Jesse has left. Jesse enters an apartment.  Guard frowns. "If I go into the other room and find it trashed, then don't find anything, you will allow me to search you and your room, eh?"  Compton stops and thinks about this for a second, his brow krikling up, "I,um... I mean, like, its no my room eh?" he says in his defense.  "Right." The Guard leans in close... but not too close - god that smell is bad. He gets a narrow-eyed, evil-as-he-can-try-to-be look in his eyes, "I better not hear anything else from you, ya hear?"  Tiziano is on th phone asking questions such as will is dad be have to be told of this disturbence and can everything be done quietly. More then liky he is told his father shall be told. To which he will ask why.  "Sir, yes sir. sir" The old hipster agrees, too readily realizing he's off the hook. "Good day to ya to eh?"  "Oh, and I don't normally smell like this... Long story." Compton adds, trying to salvage his dignity a little.  Guard says, "Right. Anyway, go get clean. You smell terrible." Guard wanders off.  Compton looks like he's going to explain, but decides to just get lost.  You push through the glass doors and leave the Holiday Inn. Downtown - Spadina and King W(#257RJ)       This is the central bar area of Toronto. There is a bar on every corner, and from Thursday to Saturday it is next to impossible to find parking. The line-ups get huge and the hot dog venders get wealthy. On the northwest corner stands the neon monument called Whiskey Saigon, and near by are other bars such as Dirk Gently's and Power Bar. The Coloured Stone is located kitty-corner to Whiskey, a trendy bar and pool hall. Restaurants are also common in this area, everything from a bar and grill, to the finer dining experiences. Things are relatively more quiet other nights, but there is always traffic. The sidewalks are a clean white colour and the streets have been repaved, to the delight of motorists driving through the city. Even the planters with the flowers and the trees make this section a brighter place.  You enter the lobby area of the Holiday Inn. Holiday Inn(#2848RnAJ)       This spacious lobby area has many comfortable seats and a fire place. It is very clean, except for the clutter of baggages placed on the floor by the people checking in or out. Loads of magazines are organized on a centrally located coffee table. The front desk has a couple of employees signing in guests. A gift shop entrance is located right next to the front desk area, displaying all sorts of Ontario and Canada goodies for the passing tourist to purchase. A large area opens up through a passage way on the far side of the lobby and the faint scent of chlorine drfits in from a heated pool out of sight.  Contents: Room176(#4941ed) Room174(#4497ed) Room172(#4869ed) Room170(#5048ed) Room169(#5091ed) Room167(#5822ed) Room166(#5258ed) Room165(#7658ed) Room164(#6674ed) Room159(#6092ed) Room158(#7027ed) Room157(#5983ed) Room156(#7909ed) Room154(#6976ed) Room152(#5498ed) Room150(#5751ed) Room139(#2747ed) Front Desk Obvious exits: Out     room174 You enter the apartment. Room174(#4497ed)       To the right of the entrance is a modest bathroom that is sparkling clean. This room has two queen-sized beds separated by a few feet, with plenty of blankets and large fluffy pillows. Inside the second drawer of the nightstand that sits between the beds is a copy of Gideon's Bible. Across from the nightstand on the far wall is a TV that offers hours of cable entertainment. A note near the TV remote reminds you that pay-per-view adult movies will be added to your bill.      There is a window that overlooks the parking lot on the far side, next to a table with two chairs. Behind the table is the room environmental unit built into the wall, giving you control of the heat and air conditioning.                                                   Obvious Exits: Out    Contents: Jesse Penny  Compton slips back in, all quiet and rather un-Compton like.  Jesse is lying on a sleeping bag on the floor, one hand tucked behind his head, the other dealing with a lit cigarette. "Oi. Rock. The fuck happened? Penn just wigged and I scripted a xanax and a vicodin. You freaked too?"  Penny says, "Nn.. " she wants, sensing Compton's arrival "..water."  "Anyway I don't think it's just you. Eva's awol. I think she and I had about the same level of reservations about coming here only she stuck to hers. And what happened to the comsys? I thought that was functioning back when we were living on Fresno-time. Gah.. I keep getting this feeling like we've been deserted, yeah? Like the sane, the rational have parted company."  Without saying anything, he goes to the bathroom, pulls the garbach bag from the can before taking his stinking shirt off and bagging it. The pants are soon to follow. So now we have a big almost naked guy who's still wiffy standing there, looking at Jesse, "Beats me... go in to your satchel and get me those mini-bottles I stashed there. I need a fucking drink." before turning back to the bathroom. Shortly the sound of a running shower can be heard.  Jesse laughs, and leaves the cigarette in his mouth long enough to snag the strap of his satchel and sling it skidding across the carpet to gently thud against the bathroom door. "Who was the kid?"  From beyond the bathroom door, a Comptons voice calls through, "Some kid that bugged me when I was golfing at the gardens. Said his name was Fagiano, or DizzyCamo or somthing like that... Wop name. Ms. Congeneality out there wanted some coffee."  "Do we need to give him a free spin?" Jesse has the oddest euphemisms for killing people. Honestly, now. He yawns widely. "Did you get the coffee at least?"  "Fucked if I know." comes from the bathroom.  From the bed, Penny makes drifting noises "He needs to pass go a few more times. /Whiney/ little fuck. I looked," she means she Looked "at him and if there ever was a kid that needed to be on lithium.. shit that kid's it. And parental supervision. Who leaves their kid alone in a place like this? God. Television is the replacement parenting unit."  "Fuck off, Penny." Jesse calls from the floor, without malice. "Some of us wish we'd been raised by televisions."   "No," totally buzzkilled "we didn't get the fucking coffee."  "Yeah. I know. And I'm saying it was a shitty fucking childhood, okay? I can't love a tv, Jes. And the tv doesn't love me. It's an empty vessel."  Compton exits the bathroom, wrapped in Pennys kimono, and a towel wrapped around his head. "MInd telling me now, what the fuck that whole surreal deal was about?" he asks. His voice is tired. Dry. He was fighting off a stupor before whatever happened, happened. Now he's lost that struggle and has gone in to wrecked buick stage. He sits on the end of his bed, and cranks the seal in a mini-bottle of Smirnoff.  "Television's better'n some alternatives, is all I'm saying." Jesse grunts his agreement when Compton re-emerges. "Yeah. The fuck did happen?"  Compton drains the tiny bottle, and tosses it at the can, missing by about two feet. Next a bottle of Southern Comfort is offered up.  Penny can't get out of this moment. Re-telling is like re-living and the more she says it, the real-er it becomes. Groudhog's Day. "Kid said he knew Compton. So they're talking, right?" New drugs making her slow, cohesive and solid "and I get the filter packs from the bathroom while they're talkin'lsd and some shit and when I come back? something's totally wrong." She yawns and sits up "Give it here," hand extended to palm the SoCo, takes a little and stretches. "He's saying we're making him angry. I'swe-ah - angry. Like the fucking Hulk would say it, y'know? That was some David Banner shit. So I read the kid and it's like he's.." trails off, pondering "..more. More than a kid."  Compton takes back the remainder of the bottlette, and drains it. He listens, about intently as Jesse, for although he was ther, he saw all the actors, he still has no idea what the plot was. Next bottle: Beefeaters. Mmmm, piney goodness.  Penny sheds the jacket, the glasses, her socks. That belt. The earring. All these accoutrement. Unecessary in the crunch or crux of conversation "He's just a kid, right?" questioning Compton "He's just a kid but there was something else. It was like looking at tree and when the lights snapped on, the whole root-structure shows up in x-ray. The whole answer. The big picture. The entire theme to this kid's life was right there and he wasn't a kid!"  Compton finished the last of the gin, and sighs, looking at the empty, tosses it at the can, and misses, but puts it right next to the empty vodka on the floor. "Bed time" he states simply, and stands, walking over to the window side of the far bed. Then he drops Pennys poor kimono, and for a moment you're all exposed to the full horror that is the 'Full Compy' before he climbs under the covers, "Or it's the drugs, Penny." he says with dying interest, "Or he's a fucking demon. Either way I'm fine, you're fine. Next time we just leave kids alone. Right?"  She whimpers; out of fear or concedeing the point - isn't clear. "I'm sorry man, it was the drugs. I really thought I needed that coffee. But I know what I saw."  "Bitch, put some pants on."   That comment or any other, no matter how sound or based in self-preservation is lost on the old guy, as a soft drone of snoring comes from the far side of the room. Well, at least he don't stink no more.  ***And so the longest, most pointless scene finally ends at 5am EST. Kudos the Merc forbeing apillar of reason and calmness.
