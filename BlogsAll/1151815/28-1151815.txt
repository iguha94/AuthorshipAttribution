         Imogen pages: Sorry to disturb you, I wanted to include you into the scene I'm about to run here. but YOu're in a building. This has to occur on the street. You paged Imogen with 'I am?'. Waterfront - Yonge and Queens Quay(#1102RJ)  OOC Imogen waves OOC Penny waves  Imogen pages: I know some of this will be some OOC info, but here's what's happened from me thusfar Imogen pages: The dismal rain begins to fall from the sky as twilight approaches the city. Within the Shadowlands the terrain is even more bleak as it's tainted with the effects of Oblivion. Through the streets, dreary looking Quick travel as through burdened by the weight of the world on their backs.  The occasional car passes down the road, when a loud banging sound is heard and echoes through the Shadowlands from somewhere just around the corner.  Imogen pages: I believe I will have to page you with what you see, I regret the inconvenience. :( I will soon create a command that will make all this flow more easily.)  Imogen pages: The effects of what's about to occur will happen in the Skinlands You paged Imogen with 'Ah!'. Long distance to Imogen: Penny sits tight, then. Imogen pages: Any chance you saw that last pose? You paged Imogen with 'Nope.'.  Imogen pages: The twilight air of Toronto heralds with it a light rain. The city street is mostly vacant except the occasional passing car. One such vehicle begins to come near the intersection in which you stand. The driver looks awake, but exhausted from a typical day at work.  You paged Imogen with 'Should I pose outloud or to you..'. Imogen pages: Please pose outloud. If you want to do anything 'special' during this scene, just page that info to me    No umbrella, no raincoat. That's some plan of action Penny's got. She looks at the sky with some misgiving and slouches her way toward a nearby overhang. But the doors keep opening and people keep edging her out of the way. She tries to light up a few times, moves into a doorframe with a 'FERME' sign flipped. Pressing back into it, she strikes a match and watches the people start to scatter off; catching buses, hailing cabs and pooling themselves into the subways.  Imogen pages: Mere seconds later, the vehicle is lurched into chaos. The driver flings his arms around wildly as though suffering horrible hallucinations or just basically 'freaking out'. The tires squeal and the car arches hard off the street proper to barrel down the sidewalk. 4 Pedestrians who turn startled by the sound shriek in terror as the car rolls quickly towards them.  Long distance to Imogen: Penny has a rote she'd like to use. Simple: smoke signal - she breathes out the enochian word for 'Over here' and spirits in the penumbra talk to her, tell her what's going on. Imogen pages: Ok, what spirit will you attempt to contact? What animal? You paged Imogen with 'Any, really. It's not a totem kinda thing. She's just putting it out there that she's watching and wants to know what's happening.'. Imogen pages: I believe it's an Arete roll vs 6.   Long distance to Imogen: Penny nods. //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" privately to Imogen at diff 6. For a total of 3 success(es).  Imogen pages: Some of the people are too slow, and they are caught under the wheels of the out of control car and it's lunatic driver. Moments after running down 2 of them the car collides with a light pole standing near to the road. The red spray of crimson mist splatters along the windshield and steering wheel. Cries announce from those nearby and some of the patrons of nearby establishments rush out from the noise to find out what's going on.  Imogen pages: The spirit detects nothing unnatural going on nearby. If anything is going on, it's within a realm that the spirit cannot sense. You paged Imogen with 'Excellent.'.  Penny drags hard, exhales harder and keeps frozen inside the doorway. It's true what they say about carwrecks - you just can't turn away. Her gaze travels from the mowed down people to the car to the lightpole. Caught there, she yells at people emerging from doors and windows, presumably with a lot of other voices "Don't! That's a live wire! Get back!" murmuring to herself something mean and subtle about dumb frogs, lurching from the recess suddenly to turn to those nearby "GET BACK."  Imogen pages: Individuals are smart, but peoplethey're stupid. Luckily the morbid nature of most of the population tends to make them all observers rather than to actually get involved when something horrific is occurring around them. So most just circle around the car gawking at the pleasant red color trickling down the car's glass. Some raise their hands to cover their mouths but at least one of them has the common sense to grab a phone.  OOC Imogen says "Pending on Penny, I believe" Takoda arrives from the north. Takoda has arrived.  Penny looks at her phone once, then up to the accident and tucks it back to that inner pocket of her jacket. Who would she call? She looks out at the crowd again and shuffles people behind her with an assertiveness of an old hand; crowd control doesn't come naturally but who'll argue with a shaved woman? That's right - not these nice, normal people. Herded away, some cry at the horror and happenstance of it all. When questioned later some may say "He just came out of nowhere," and "I was just leaving work" - they rehearse these things among themselves as Penny leaves them, against better judgement, to get a better look at the plates of the car. Or something.  //.etro: Imogen rolls "4" at diff 6 For a total of 3 success(es).  Lights. Red and Blue and White and Yellow: That's the first thing that comes to view. And then a Forest green SUV comes barrelling down the road, slowing as it approaches what looks to be... Well, a mess. Slowing down, so as not to hurt another pedestrian, the SUV, with the White Stenciled letters, 'Parn Warden' stops a number of yards from the actual accident. The vehicle is turned off, but the lights remain flashing, and out steps Takoda. "Fuck." He mutters to himself, before he states, while exiting the car, over the Dispatch channel, "This is officer Wanikiya arriving on scene, requesting immediate Emergancy aid and backup. We've got a crowd."  //.etro: Imogen rolls "3" at diff 5 For a total of 1 success(es).  EMS Units sound their sirens down the street. The echo of the wail reverberates through the buildings accompanied shortly afterwards by the police.  Well of course there's a crowd. It's rush hour, there's dead people on the pavement and no cops in sight .. except the park ranger.  Penny looks around for other gawkers to blend with, catches the tail end of some Eaton Center shopper-crowd and walks with them. She talks quietly with one of the tourists, pointing at her camera. The pantomime under the noise could be read a few ways; either she wants Penny to take a picture of her or is giving the camera to Penny.  Takoda finishes his statement, before he jogs over to the first of the downed pedestrians. "Everybody please stay back." He shouts, as people draw closer, and he bends down to check the person's pulse. His movements belay a certain grace, a comfort in his own body that few people manage to achieve. Any sign of authority is 'something' and the flashing lights of his SUV appear to give Takoda some authority. Most of the pedestrians move back, but remain within eyeshot.  The order in the area is, of course, objective. Any kind of Canadian crowd'll have it's hecklers and it's shriekers; it's weeping and its morbidly curious. In this burgeoning, Penny focuses the polaroid on the car, snaps off one shot, then hands it back to the sweaty-palmed tourist with another brief exchange. Thank-yous, some might opine and be right. She pockets the picture before it develops and edges around the crowd. The question on everyone's lips is "Is the driver still alive?"  //.etro: Jeff rolls for Initiative: wits + dex + 1d10 -> 11 Tex arrives from the north. Tex has arrived. //.etro: Imogen rolls "8" at diff 6 For a total of 1 success(es).  More sirens wail in the distance, but one squad car screeches to a sudden halt as it approaches the scene. The crowd of onlookers earns a scowl from Tex, as he steps from his awkwardly parked car. He approaches the wrecked vehicle and the crowd, taking his badge out, and tucking it in his coat pocket to identify him as a officer.  OOC Penny says "It's Takoda's pose, yeah?" OOC Takoda says "Yes, I was waiting on something.:)" //.etro: Imogen rolls "2" at diff 6 For a total of 1 success(es) including 1 ten(s).    Tom has arrived. Tom goes back IC.  Takoda steps up from the first person on the sidewalk, seeming to be content with the heartbeat of that individual. The second one gets a glance, as the woman moans. "Don't worry Ma'am, EMT's are on their way." He says closer to her, bending down for a moment to examine her, before he finally moves to the car. He whips out a flashlight, and shines it inside to take another quick one over, reaching inside to place his fingers on the driver's neck. Again, he nods, and steps back, glancing over as Tex arrives, speaking into his walkie-talkie on his shoulder. "This is officer Wanikiya, I have two wounded, another critically. Please send additional EMT assistance."  Wool coat tossed loosely over his shoulders, Tom seems to be exiting from the Liquor Store, a little unawares of the whole situation. Perhaps a slight fog - narcotic or alcoholic or just the moisture in the air acting on his sinuses - acts on his senses. Regardless, he looks slightly dazed by the scene of disorder that confronts him once he's exited the store. In a mild state of shock, he hefts up the brown paper bag full of clanking beer bottles he has gathered into one arm. Numbly, he wanders a half-circle, eyes not failing to notice the spray of blood across the front windshield. Mouth half-opens, releases a semi-conscious, "Jesus... fucking... downright awful."  Tex peers at the vehicle, to see if he can spot any gas leaking from vehicle. Fluids are everywhere...no telling if petrol is involved. Turning to the crowd of onlookers, who carefully approach the accident scene. "Get back!" he barks to the people, stalking towards them like a predator. "Get the hell back!" he barks again. His attitude and tone of voice suggest he'll brook no mischief from anyone.  Penny keeps looking up, waiting for the damaged light pole to fall. Penny, pending doom. She drops back another few feet, bumping into people when the officer raises his voice. She keeps her head down, reaching behind her neck, tugging out the hooded part to cover up. "Is he? Did they say?" someone on a cellphone keeps asking Penny - like she's some authority on who lives and dies in the street. "Look, I dunno. Ask that guy, he's the cop yeah?" nodding over to Tex.  Takoda read your description.  Takoda looks over to Tex, nodding to the man in gratitude, before he leans back down again, into the car. "Sir, sir, can you hear me? Emergancy services are on their way sir, you're gonna be alright..." He meanwhile shines his flashlight around inside the car, looking for any passangers, or any signs of mischief.  The driver appears to have lost consciousness. Trauma to the head from impact with the Steering wheel then the glass Obviously not wearing his seat belt correctly.  As Tex barks at the crowd, Tom dutifully withdraws. Either shame or common sense (or, perhaps, both) prevails in getting him to take his eyes away from the whole reprehensible, compelling, disheartening scene. He paces the outskirts of the crowd, hugging foreign beers to his chest, scanning the faces of his fellow onlookers, eyes burning, alight; a penetrating gaze.  Tex reaches into his pocket, and produces a set of car keys. "Don't get any closer!" he tells the crowd in a gravel-scratch voice. He runs to the trunk of his car, and opens it. He rummages around inside, and produces a duffel kit, and the typical roll of yellow tape. He runs back to the crowd to ensure that his orders were complied with. "Officer, don't let that guys head move. Keep tabs on his pulse." he asks the man. He drops the duffel bag, and finds a mailbox to tie some tape off too. "And get a E.T.A. on our medical." he says. He has a feeling that the driver dosen't have very long.  The lights of the Ambulance herald in the EMS. It's approach is slow, yes but here it is. Once it grinds to a halt 3 Emergency technicians exit carrying their gurney and move quickly to the site of the crash.  "Gotchya." Takoda states, making sure to make no sudden movements near the man's head. It's rather obvious he isn't quite used to this sort of situation, but seems to be handling it just fine. "ETA is any minute..." His voice trails off as the ambulance arrives. When the EMT's begin to head over, he steps back from the vehicle, glancing down at his bloodied hand, from checking the driver's pulse.  Penny turns a shoulder to the scene when the ambulance finally arrives, its sirens heralding help. Seems to be an effective way to get people moving again, restoring order to the momentarily paralysis of the commuting public. She shudders, touching her way through the pedestrians, kindling side-to-side glances; who touched me? what was that? was that you? No it wasn't; just Penny in wake, shaking out the polaroid.  Imogen pages: That still will be probably worth some money with the local newspaper. :) Imogen pages: still=photo, whatever. :) Long distance to Imogen: Penny images it would be. What's it show us? Imogen pages: When did you take it? Long distance to Imogen: Penny scrolls up. You paged Imogen with 'Right before Jeff's roll. And exactly before Tex arrived.'.   Jaw squared off, Tom's pale eyes twist away from the crowd. There's something in the reflections on their eyes he doesn't like to look at. The blood - or maybe the strange, gaping sort of hunger. If not for blood, than for information, than for a story to watch. A generation of people grown up on car chases and wrecks in the movies now avidly consuming real life as though it were entertainment. As though it were sold to them, and they were buying. An easy walk carries him away from the scene, towards his car, parked an alarmingly close distance away. Moistening his dry bottom lip, he struggles to keep his legs still, keep the tremble out until he's safe in his car and on the road.  One Emergency care technician exits the van and moves to Tex to find out the details of the situation. The 3 that exited earlier divide and each attends one of the fallen victims of the accident. One to each person that was run over, then another to the driver. Once there he says to Takoda, "Thank you sir, I have it from here."  A yellow barricade of tape is erected slowly, with room left for EMT's to do their job. Tex runs the tape along his own pre-set path, moving pedestrians and traffic out of his way rather roughly, if they do not comply. A few zig-zags later, he ties off the tape and a established accident scene is created. That being done, he lets the EMTs do thier job, and he can really begin his. A notepad and pencil are pulled from his coat. "Who can tell me what happened here? Did anyone see the accident?" he barks out to the crowd of onlookers. Someone here saw what happened, he's sure.  Takoda seems again, relieved that the EMT has taken over. He steps back from the car, clicking his flashlight off, slipping it into a small clot on his belt. Clicking the pouch closed, he glances about once more, before he heads slowly towards his SUV, parked just outside of the Police yellow tape. his Red and blue flashing lights still do their thing, and he leans into the open driver's side door to remove a small white metal box. Opening it, he pull sout some sterile towels, and a bottle of disinfectant, and goes to work on his hand.   Imogen pages: Lets see, within the SKinlands you coudl have gotten a picture  of whatever you like. :) Should anything 'special' be done with the photo so see other realms I've noted what would be on the still.  //.etro: Imogen rolls "8" at diff 4 For a total of 7 success(es) including 2 ten(s). //.etro: Imogen rolls "1" at diff 2 For a total of 1 success(es).  You paged Imogen with ''nother roll maybe?'. Imogen pages: Sure thing if you like.  //.etro: Arlen rolls for Initiative: wits + dex + 1d10 -> 11   //.etro: Imogen rolls "1" at diff 6          For a total of 0 success(es). //.etro: Arlen rolls "strength + 3" at diff 6          For a total of 3 success(es). //.etro: Imogen rolls "7" at diff 6          For a total of 3 success(es).  Order is established, or at least to the satisfaction of Tex. He starts taking statments from the witnesses to the accident. The EMT is privy to what's being said, to avoid any confusion. And to save Tex the time of having to re-tell the same story.  Imogen pages: Anything for me?  With the beer secure in the passenger seat, Tom pulls on his safety belt. Makes sure the damn thing is extra tight, adjusted correctly, his seat isn't loose, the steering column is tilted to best prevent injury... once he's satisified that his mirrors are in a state of relative symmetry, he starts the car and begins to pull away. Pressing the play button on his CD player, he tries to sink into the relaxing sounds of a Phil Collins CD that came with the car. As he mouths the words to Su-su-sudio, he does his best to put the whole awful event out of mind.
