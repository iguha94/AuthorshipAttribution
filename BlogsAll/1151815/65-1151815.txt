         Novus Valnastium -- Main Chamber          The main hall of Novus Valnastium is a wide, stone area, with arching buttresses and columns framing windows that stream with bright, comfortable light. Several circles of chairs and old-fashioned divans and davenports are scattered around the room, conversational areas if you will, and a center hearth flickers with a warm, comfortable flame. A set of stairs on the left leads up to a balcony that rings the area, several doors leading off it, and great double doors lead forward and to the left, right, and behind you. Two armored figures, silent as the grave, flank the doors ahead of you, as well as two others flanking the doors to the rear, which lead back out onto the open plains.

Niko smiles, 'She gave up her family and friends to be with me..I don't want her caught because I didn't get the best...and she doesn't know who she wants to lead.."    Viktor says "night" Viktor has disconnected. Niko looks to Alex, "Besides...I'm going to push their offer to provide support and see if it's serious  Viktor thinks for a moment and heads to the library. "Well, I'm off to do some research. I'll see you all later."  //.etro: It is 06:10 am, early morning, on Sunday the 22. day of March, 2009.  "Later,"Alex says to Viktor with a small nod as the man heads toward the library.  Was Penny always there? Hard to say, things not being as linear as they could be. Regardless, she's there now. Between a few short, quick steps her phone beeps and while it may be true that certain grids can not be accessed out here in the nowhere, other particular matricies are always available.  Skirting the hearth, she advances on a place just to the left of the library. Just a few days ago a shroud of a sort was laid out. The strong smell hovers in that general area but nowhere else in the hall.  The phone is still beeping when Penny tugs it, and a smoke, out of her pocket. She thumbs the buttons for a few seconds until it's quiet.  Cassius pages: Alright, you get a message back saying. Wil du. Luv u. You paged Cassius with 'Texting back: Body was hidden .. here? Need 2 bring it 2 our place.'. Cassius pages: Hard 2 do Big guys will stop. You paged Cassius with 'Y? We need 2 lay him 2 rest. 2morrow. things 2 do.'. Cassius pages: Big guys wont let me take things from the place You paged Cassius with 'Will carry him myself then. where is he?'.   Catherine looks at you She says something short in a language you don't understand.  she yawns...hiding it behind her hand.  Alex glances over to Penny when she step into the room. "Come back for the rest of Chase?..." he asks her, a slight frown coming to his face.  Niko smiles to Cathy, 'then come and curl up with me and I'll carry you to bed after..'  Connelly 's sleeping on the floor in a corner of the room.... Catherine does just so, resting her head against Niko..  Penny has the bearing and mien of a person teetering on the far side of rational. Her shoulders too stiff, her posture too erect. The corner of her mouth twists, up. Down. The dead-white crust in corners, she is thin-lipped. Her gaze fixes on the phone. She thumbs something out on the keypad and looks toward Alex, her eyes rimmed red and peeled wide open "Yes."  Catherine does fall asleep...  "Oh,"Alex says with a smirk, almost a chuckle,"Too bad he is not here... But I am curious... What is it that you had planned to do with Chase's head and body?..."  Niko sits on a divan with Cathy salseep and resting across his lap as he toys with her hair and just watches on  Taliesin enters the Hall from the Library. Taliesin has arrived.  Taliesin comes out of the library and starts walking in the direction of the council chambers.  Niko sees tal enter and doesn't pause to say hello or anything else, 'tal..you wouldn't be an Adept of Ars Animae by any chance...woul dyou?"  Alex is standing by the hearth in the same area where Niko is seated. His eyes, however, are on Penny. Perhaps waiting for a response or a reaction.  Taliesin comes to a halt when Niko addresses him, "An Adept of Ars Anime? No, I'm afraid not. I've been focusing my studies on the sphere of Prime lately. Why what do you need a Life adept for?"  Niko smiles to tal, 'Well..now I have to add to my request..need an Adept of Life to make the changes to Cathy..I can change my face..not hers  The tap-click-beep-beep noise of Penny-with-the-phone is a constant throughout the conversation. She doesn't look down as she types, operating by feel. A sandpaper sound comes out where her voice is requisite "It was said already. There is a letter to follow, instructions" she emphasizes "hoc monumentum heredem exterum non sequitur."  It's possible that she believe this should make sense.   Taliesin ahs softly, "I may have a solution to that. I'll get to work on it." He glances over at Penny, "How are you using a cellphone here? I can't believe you're even within roaming range. I know mine doesn't work?"  "And when I asked to see this... letter, while you were stealing Chase's head at gun point, you gave me an envelope full of dried leaves...." Alex says in response to Penny's statement,"I would think that, as a leader of this Chantry, what is done with Chase's body is a Chantry matter."  Pobble enters the Main Hall through the Fields, closing the massive double doors behind him. Pobble has arrived.  "I never pointed a gun at you, Alex" her declaration a means to free her from that conversation, ending with "we are his next-of-kin and are due his remains." Quiet for a few minutes while she rearranges the three shrouds ontop of one another, Penny pockets the phone "It doesn't work," pushing the jet stones and other detrius into the center of the plastic sheets "it only talks to god."  Kneeling, Penny looks at her work, unsatisfied and fixated.  Pobble pushes the door open, allowing a suited monkey to scamper through, trailing a luminescent exhaust of cigar fumage in its wake. Sashaying behind the smokestack is a hooded man, black coat worn closed with the oversized hood shrouding his features in shadow. The fine shoes tap on the stone, as the man follows monkey into the chamber. A cigarette dangles precariously from thin blood stained fingers, the claret glinting fresh as the cherry ember sparkles on silver fingernails.  The pair come to a stop, suddenly and as one. The motion whips the heavy smoke around and in an overly dramatic manner, the fellow throws back his hood. The empty eyes of Dr Steve are revealed. Emaciated and haggard, his head shifts in the only indication that he scans the room, given the blank eyes.  Taliesin nods slowly to Penny, her commentary about her cellphone's abilities at communion being left alone for now. He asks, expecting that someone will know the answers, "Where is the body now? It should be handed over to them, as soon as possible. When will the College be holding the memorial? I know that myself and some others would like to attend."  Niko hmms a little, 'It's not a memorial they are doing...not right off, anyway.."  //.etro: It is 07:28 am, mid-morning, on Sunday the 22. day of March, 2009.  Alex let's out a sharp bark of a laugh,"Is /that/ what they were doing when they hacked into Chase's head with a kitchen knife?... Preparing for a memorial?..." he asks seeming rather doubtful of that explaination.  Taliesin raises a finger to the two Virtual Adepts, "Gentlemen, before you start in on defending the dignity of the corpse of a man that neither one of you was particularly fond of, I would like to speak with Penny about this. As a leader of the Chantry it is right that I should do so." He motions for Penny, Pobble and Dave to join him in the library.   Niko gives Tal a look and frowns a bit, "Make sure you run a lie detector.."  Penny stops what she was doing with the positioning of the plastic, muttering something about the squares not holding the circles. She stops because Pobble walked in. Instinct guides a hand from the floor to her side, the way a person looking to arm themselves might keep a loaded gun. The left hand from the floor to her right side stays there and does not move.  Dave Monkey nods, "S'right." he says slowly, waving his cigar around indignantly. "I'd have said he'd've rather 'ad is head cut awf that spent a quiet weekend with yous." The obnoxiously little monkey begins to swagger across towards Taliesin. The latter comment from Niko causes the fella to stop and he goes to say something but a following Pobble ends the statement pre-emptively with a kick to the rear. The monkey moves on but Dr Steve pauses to stare at Niko, "You are certainly full of insinuations today young man.." he says in a hoarse whisper, dried blood flaking on his cracked lips. "You should becareful where you aim such weapons of disunity." This said, he moves towards Penny and offers her his arm.  Niko glances to Dave and smiles, 'If daisy had not told me precisely what you all were looking to do, then I would not be so worried with your behavior..". He offers an obvious fake smile to Dave, 'And don't go calling me 'young man'."  Seemingly amused by Dave's antics, Taliesin offers Niko a slight smile, "I'm sure I can handle things just fine." He stands patiently waiting for the members of the Invisible College to proceed him into the library.  "First of all, Tal,"Alex says turning toward the man,"You are wrong about me not liking my former cabalmate. And second, Penny would not of had to come here, guns drawn, if there was any explaination as to what they were doing with Chase's head and body."           This fine gentleman is probably in the 25-30 age bracket, and is posessed of an unhealthy pallor, his skin having a washed out look to it as if he's been dry cleaned one too many times. Haircut looks to be home made, low grade clippers job but just a little patchy in places where there are hints of blue in the stubble. His eyes are apparently fitted with some form of contact lens, since they are a pale milky white with no iris or pupil visible. His pallid skin is contrasted by the adornments that mark it. Besides the peircings (1) there are numerous tattoos, the main design being a series of small black marks that ring his head in a strip about an inch wide reminiscent of a crown of thorns laden with black ink. Under his left eye, starting at the peak of the cheekbone are three thin vertical black lines, varying sizes with the middle the longest at about an inch. Finally, an abstract design formed from intersecting black and white squares, about the size of a silver dollar adorns his neck on the right.          Dressed to impress in a four figure suit in a black that purposefully looks a touch faded. Its appears to have been fitted perfectly, but the stylistic crispness is convoluted into a more casual style by virtue of an unbuttoned jacket, and the white crinkled silk shirt worn untucked with its top button open. The cuffs of the shirt protrude at perfect lengths, fastened with flat round headed cuffs consisting of blank white circles. The hands that emerge from the expert tailoring are also thin and on the pale side, accentuated by patches of dried blood (2). Precisely pressed and creased pants with precision turnups and length are finished up by a pair of stylish black shoes that appear both classy and designed for duty with thick soles and what could be steel toe caps.          Cold repelling is perfomed by a full length black crushed velvet overcoat, apparently with an added inner lining. In contrast to the fine attire beneath, the velvet hasn't held up too well in the snow and rain and is starting to become patchy in places while having that drowned rat look to it while wet. It has an oversized hood, and deep out-side pockets.          He speaks with a South London accent, sounding quite common at times no matter the covabluary he wields. He moves wearily, as if each motion is a true feat of willpower and each step a mile.      Penny seems to wince at the offer, seems to recoil from Pobble or Dave, seems to give a great deal of consideration to his extended hand and none at all to the conversation going on around her. Equal parts fear and delerium keep her quite motionless, a wide open stare travelling slowly upwards. Caught her own reflection in the shine of Pobble's shoes, Penny winces again.  "..not just yet," she whispers to the steel toes, taking his bloodied hand. Is it then that her hand becomes red as well? or was it before... "cycle hasn't resolved."  Dave Monkey mutters as he heads into the library, casting a look back at Niko, pointing his cigar as if it were a rifle. It could be, its the right size. No shot however, Dave Monkey, saving the lives of those he despises. He whispers into the momentary silence. "I have every right to call you boy if I wish. Do not condescend the monkey. The monkey is ancient. The monkey has many friends across many layers of existence. The monkey takes no prisoners." This is said with remarkable venom.  Dr Steve smiles, sadly. As if an act of simple kindness had destroyed the world. A slight nod, and a gentle squeeze of Pen's hand. He then leads her to the library in silence. There is an air of resignation about his motions when close to Penny, his wasted features growing sadder still.  "I think the chimp just threatened you Niko,"Alex says as he moves to take a seat in a nearby armchair.  Niko looks to Alex, "He'll throw feces next, I'm sure.."  You head to the door marked 'Library' and head through into the room beyond. Novus Valnastium -- Library          High shelves, comfortable chairs, warm lights, and wide tables adorn this room. Large rugs of various types of fur spread out, here and there. On one wall is a hearth that seems to always burn with a quiet, warm flame. This room is a bibliophile's dream, with books on magick, books on history, in fact, books on almost anything one might think about.         Currently, most of the books are still away, packed in Hermetically sealed crates which line the walls of the room. Soon, though, the boxes will be unpacked and the library will be complete.  Obvious exits: Out     Pobble enters the Library from the Main Hall. Pobble has arrived.  Taliesin enters the Library from the Main Hall. Taliesin has arrived.  Taliesin follows shortly thereafter and closes the door behind him. He looks at the three of you, "Can you guys tell me what's going on? I'm more than willing to help you memorialize Chase, but I need to know what the hub bub is all about."  Dave Monkey says, "Awright Tal me ole mucka." The indignance of youth forgotten it seems, the Monkey hops into a chair and performs admirably the task of looking happy for the entire Colledge. Matted fur around the eyes attests otherwise maybe, but for now those saucer pupils are filled with something that resembles glee.  Dr Steve comes to stand near Dave. Releasing Penny he seems to slump down as if a great weight has been returned to his neck, Steve Atlas. The chair seems to be the only thing supporting his defiance of the tyranny of gravity. His head shifts, eyes possibly moving to Penny to allow her to explain.   The monkey, ill conceived little steward that he is, leads the way for the strained couple. She folds herself down to the side of the chair, not for lack of strength but because just at that moment Dave, Pobble and Penny exist in a kind of Raphaelite symmetry.  "It's to do with dates. Time, really. It's the right time." A pause, her voice still paperthin and erraticly octaved "Um. I'm sorry who are you? I don't think we've .. met."   The other two nod solemnly at this. Eerily in time with one another. Questioning looks await response.  This earns a look for Dr. Steve and Dave from Taliesin. He sighs and grips his white oak staff taking a deep breath before speaking, "Penny, I am Taliesin Emrys. I'm a Celestial Chorister and I'm a friend of Chase. I'm trying to figure out what is going on with his remains that has caused such a problem. I'm not understanding your explanation, so if you could try to explain it to me, more simply. I'd appreciate it."  Penny ohs, maybe making a mental note. Studying Tal, intent on his staff, his posture, she brings a knee up, readjusting her position on the floor. Hooking an elbow around it, she rests her head, a dark bloodied palm-print left on the black jeans.   "It isn't my .. I haven't got the words .." a pregnant pause, like she's waiting for an invitation.  Taliesin is really trying here, "Ms. Ante, I need you to try please. This is causing trouble that Chase would not have wished. I want to help you do right by Chase, but I need you to help me do that."  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" at diff 4          For a total of 1 success(es).  Penny shifts again to pull a notepad and a sharpie from the apron pocket she sits on. There's another uncomfortable moment where Penny just stares at Tal. All processes pending circulation. The sense of muted urgency breaks when she teeths the cap off, grips the pen. In a quick hand she writes the words REQUIESCAT IN PACE on the notepad, a rectangle, scribbles that look nothing like the english-letter alphabet, a discoball, a television and seven stick-figures in a circle. She rips the page off the top, a bloody thumbprint set squarely inside the stick-figures.  "Here, here" holding the note out for him.  Taliesin takes the paper, looks at it and nods. "I see. What were you guys doing with his head though? Was there something you were trying to get out?"  Pobble has disconnected.  It's not the strongest projection ever built but it conveys enough; that they're giving Chase his due; a bacchanal.  Penny slumps back to the chair and looks up at Pobble before rasping, scratching something from the corner of her mouth "His skull of course. And the pieces that did not belong to him. Part of the deal. Return to sender."  Taliesin ahs softly, "He had some sort of implant then? And you guys were taking it out to send it back to the person who gave it to him?"  Penny nods, folding away the notepad, capping the marker. It isn't so much that she's dumb or mute but that she can not get cohesive. A twitch here, a shiver there; subtle signs of a hunger strike.  Taliesin nods slowly, "Very well. I will have the body ready for the Invisible College to take care of in short order. If you would let me know who you're sending the implant to as well, so I can make sure they receive it, and so the others will know what's going on. I would appreciate that as well."  Taliesin sings a few bars under his breath and the pangs of hunger and deprivation fade into memory. He smiles, "No need to suffer like that any longer, Ms. Ante."  Penny shouts, "NO!"  Taliesin takes a step back, "What's the matter? Are you alright? I'll have the body for you as soon as I can. There was no need." He looks worried that perhaps he has done something wrong unintentionally.  Penny lurches forward like she could reach what was just slipped out of her grasp. She makes a noise, a wail, a cry "No! It's necessary! The letter.. " looking at Pobble who has succumbed, has passed out or slipped unconcious for minutes at a time. She raises fingers to her mouth, still chapped? "..you don't know anything!"  Taliesin smacks himself on the forehead. "My apologies." He looks ashamed of himself. "I was only trying to help. I will set you back the way you were, Ms. Ante, but before I do, is one of you remaining healthy enough to plan the bacchanal?"  Dave panicks and scoots out of sight. He's seen Penny at her shrieking, terrorizing worst, he knows better than to stick around.  "It's done," getting up knees to feet "Put it back, give it back," stumbling down as she crosses the room, tripping over the apron strings. "..give it back.."  Penny shouts, "Put it back, give it back!"  Taliesin nods, "I shall." He pulls out a stick on incense, "This is very important, before you leave, I want you to take this and burn it. I'm going to put a blessing on it that the Chorus often uses when subjecting ourselves to similar privation. If you burn it those who inhale the smoke of the incense will be able to endure your privation with greater grace. It is up to you if you wish to use it, but I respect what you're doing and want to help." He bows his head, "Lord, please forgive Your servant who has interfered with the sacrifice of another, please forgive me my foolish pride and restore the sacrifice made in the name of a friend." The pains of hunger wrack your body once more and once again it becomes difficult to think clearly due to your grumbling and forlorn stomach. He focuses on the incense and prays over it for a few moments and puts it in your bloodied hand.    Taliesin says "Eseentially if you burn it, anyone in the area who inhales the smoke will be able to deal with extreme hunger... think of it as a stamina boost directed toward exactly that."   Taliesin says "I need to go nini now."   Penny says "That's excellent."   Penny says "I'll letcha go. Say. Before you go?"   Taliesin says "Yes?"   Penny says "You're getting the body to us ..so that means I don't have to haul it out of here myself?"    Taliesin says "Right."   Taliesin says "Just let me know where you need it to go with a +mail or the like."   Penny says "Okay. Thank you. This was excellent."   Taliesin will have to recover it first of course, but that's my problem now.   Penny nodsnods. Taliesin leaves by way of the double doors, entering the Main Hall. Taliesin has left.   You open the double doors, returning to the Main Hall. Novus Valnastium -- Main Chamber          The main hall of Novus Valnastium is a wide, stone area, with arching buttresses and columns framing windows that stream with bright, comfortable light. Several circles of chairs and old-fashioned divans and davenports are scattered around the room, conversational areas if you will, and a center hearth flickers with a warm, comfortable flame. A set of stairs on the left leads up to a balcony that rings the area, several doors leading off it, and great double doors lead forward and to the left, right, and behind you. Two armored figures, silent as the grave, flank the doors ahead of you, as well as two others flanking the doors to the rear, which lead back out onto the open plains.  Contents: Alex Niko Connelly Obvious exits: Out to Fields    Laboratory Doors    Library Doors    Council Chambers      Alex is seated quietly in one of the armchair, his shade covered eyes looking in the direction of the library door.  The library door opens again. And Penny doesn't so much walk out as she shuffles between short spasms of breath. By and large this was the way she entered the room but for the very faint, very thin sheen of sweat that's broken across her features. Even now as she returns to the hall this sweat seems to be evaporating, her left hand still bloodied. The strings of the apron are rednow as well and her knee bears a dark handprint.  "What," she rasps "you were expecting someone else?"  Alex doesn't bother to answer Penny's question and his eyes don't move either. In fact, he doesn't move much at all.  Penny shrugs her jacket back the right way, the nylon making that slithery noise as she zippers it. "Whatever. Jackass." Short on words and patience in low supply, she stuffs her fists into the pockets. Penny walks toward the door slowly; her body just as stiffly resolute as when she walked in.  A faint smile creeps to Alex lips; as if Penny's words where a victory on his part. Still he remains silent and still.  Penny snorts then starts coughing. It's a terrible, colicky sound that rattles from deep, deep in the lung. She stops to try and control it, working the flem up, up and spits it to the stone floor.  Spitting on the truth, some people call it. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and leaves the hall still clearing her throat. You open the double doors and head out into the open, rolling fields beyond.
