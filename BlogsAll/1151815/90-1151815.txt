         You enter the waxworks. The large double doors swing open for you. Dark Horizons Waxworks - Main Room(#1957RJ)          This room is not particularly large. Just an entrance room, really. Heavy black curtains hang over the windows in front, shutting out almost all of the ambient light from the world beyond. The room is lit only by real candles and gas lamps. The air carries an old, almost must scent to it, giving you the sense of walking in to a building centuries old, even though it is a relatively new rennovation.         The walls are mostly wood panelled but not in any particular order. Chaos seems to be theme of the decor. The ceilings are high. Ridiculously high seeming, as if they extended far beyond human vision, in to the pitch depths up above. Something may be lurking up there, even now. In several spots there shelves are set in to the wall. Each shelf is empty. The books themselves appear to be sunken in to the walls, giving the room an even odder feel. The floors are completely bare of any sort of coverings. Just finely polished stone. In the center of the main room is a series of ten chairs. The really nice kind, with deep seats and thick velvet cushions. There is a circular table in the middle of them with two books displayed.         Off to the left side is a smallish office. In the back center of the room, you can see a pair of doors, oaken. One door has the face of a smiling demon, a brightly polished brass nameplate under it says Fiction. One door has the face of an angry, almost leering demon, another brightly polished brass nameplate under this one says Fact. There are no visible handles, just a hole in each open mouth with tongues sticking out.                                 +views available                                  Contents: Polar-bear William Matt Petra Zoe Suliman Cornelius Read Me Obvious exits: Fiction (FI)  Fact (F)  Out (O) (OOC) Zoe would think not, no.

(OOC) Cornelius says, "Just checking." (OOC) William says, "Man. Nobody saw Mulan."  Compton slinks in. The collar of his old army coat turned up against the shitty 'Vale weather. In his hand is one of those new fangled super-tiny cam-corders. Pretty high tech swag for an old bastard. He glances around at the exhibits with bloodshot eyes before going straight in to recording. Polar-bear's form blurs and a new shape steps forward. (OOC) Cornelius says, "We're not posing just yet Compton... waiting for the final consensus that we're ready." (OOC) Zoe hmms, "Cornelius - taking place before it opens? Right?" (OOC) Cornelius says, "I understand that to be the case, ja." Cornelius pages: How did you come to be here today? :) You paged Cornelius with 'By foot.  SNiffing around based on Penny's and Pobbles reports to the College.'. Cornelius pages: Mm. Right now we're about to have a blow up party. (OOC) Cornelius says, "Well, begin posing kids. Compton just walked in." (OOC) Petra says, "Um..." (OOC) Matt says, "Well appearently Compton's being allowed to horn in on our scene. So let's go." Matt hands out the contents of the backpacks, giving Petra and Suli the extra radio detenators. "Get them on the villans first, we blow those, then deal with the others. Jacob arrives with Zoe. The big guy tries to look small an inconspicuous, or as close as he can manage. The museum is quiet. In the center of the main room is a massive display set up that is covered by a large white tarp. Petra nods, taking it with one hand, shotgun held in another. She whirls at the sound of motion and levels the shotgun at the sounds. She is, of course, wearing a mask. She simply nods, then, and keeps moving. "Let's do this." as soon as they're inside, Matt decides that another form might be better for this and shifts to crinos. Matt's form blurs and a new shape steps forward. With Jacob, Zoe moves quietly, a rifle in hand, and follows behind the others. Keeping an eye on things as Matt hands out the charges, she glances to the tall guy who came in with her, a slight nod given to him before she moves once more. Suliman accepts his set of detonators and then moves out behind Petra. Nothing more to see here, despite the utterly blank expression on his face. Jacob watches Matt. Hmmm. Good idea. He takes the hint. Jacob's form blurs and a new shape steps forward. Matt stalks to the new display and rips the cover off of the thing; "I think I know, but let's bee sure." "Well, why not," says the guy who was even taller than Jacob, at some point. And he too changes. In the middle of the room is a scene of Central Park near the fountain. It is nearly a perfect replica of it, down to the little blades of grass. Even the tree seems real. But that's not the horrific part. The awful part is that there are several hundred bodies all piled about in the middle of the park. Each of them appear to have suffered a different fate. Disemboweling. Burning. Dismemberment. Crucifixion. Bludgeoning. Animal attack. Each one is a master craft of work, with the horror of the demise painted in to the face of each one shown here. There is not one peaceful soul. For anyone who troubles to count, there are six hundred sixty five dead here.  Some of these faces resemble pictures taken of those who have died over the past few weeks. In the center of it all is a rabbi standing before an altar. There is a pillow on the altar with two gold rings.  It's not that he disappears exactly. He's there, sorta. Just on the edge of your periphery vision the old bum hovers. You may see him, but quickly your vision is distracted to something else and when you look again, he's somewhere else. Slippery, elusive, Compton. Matt frowns; "Thought I saw someone. Be careful." He looks at the sculpture, and takes out four charges, calmly slapping them on the thing. "I have a present for asshole. These are coded to a seperate code. Suli. Jacob, Petra - take fact. The rest of you with me in fiction. Petra nods. "On it." She looks around once, taking the right flank as they approach the doors to Fact. A faint shudder runs through her. Suliman nods. "We're on it." He takes up a flanking position on Petra easily within arm's reach, but behind her. Vanguard-Walker looks around and sniffs the air. He nods and shuffles along with Petra. Petra levels the shotgun at the door and murmurs, "One of you open it and step back. This may get hot."  ---------------------------------[ Glance ]---------------------------------    Compton.............Dirty old man. Height: 1.8m Weight: 67 kg.

Zoe nods to Matt, her gaze upon the display, turning away when she finds the one of her grandmother. Rifle in hand, she moves to follow after Matt down Fiction hall, lips holding a faint frown. (OOC) Cornelius says, "If you guys are going to split up, gimmie a sec." Suliman eyes the door, then looks at Vanguard and motions to him. "Take the door if you would please? I think the bite of the door mechanism might be more firm today than the last foray. StormcrowSTandsAlone hands Petra a long length of the detcord. "Use this to cut a door if you need to. Quiet will be joining you in three seconds. Quiet has arrived. Quiet enters the oaken wooden door marked Fact. Quiet has left. (OOC) Cornelius says, "Quiet will be in Fact. I will take the group to Fiction." (OOC) StormcrowSTandsAlone nods. "Okay - both groups have the detcord, good for cutting new doors. :) Vanguard-Walker blinks. Bite? Last foray? Seems he didn't get all the details. OH well. He stretches out his arm to push open the door. (OOC) Cornelius says, "Just as a notice, any action you are doing that you want me to adjudicate, let me know via page after you pose it. Sometimes I realize it, sometimes I don't." Well, without toggling the handle, Vanguard-Walker finds that the door ignores his push. Gotta stick your hand in the demon's mouth, chappie. StormcrowSTandsAlone nods. "Alright let's do this. StormcrowSTandsAlone enters the oaken wooden door marked Fiction. StormcrowSTandsAlone has left. Vanguard-Walker says, "How 'bout we just knock it in?" Suliman sighs, grimaces and steps up to the door, sticks his hand into the demons mouth. StormcrowSTandsAlone exits from the room markd Fiction. StormcrowSTandsAlone has arrived. (OOC) Cornelius says, "Which door boss, Fact or Fiction?" (OOC) Cornelius says, "To Suli." (OOC) Suliman says, "Fact." Cornelius rolls 4 (4 dice) at a difficulty of 6:  (10) 3 (10) 4 Achieving 2 successes, resulting in a moderate success. Jumpstart slips between Stormcrow and Zoe, grunting in an 'excuse me, oh excuse me' fashion. Gamely, bravely, foolishly, he does that hand-shoving thing to open the door. Demon's tongue, yadda yadda. Cornelius rolls 4 (4 dice) at a difficulty of 6:  (8) 3 -1- (8) Achieving 1 successes, resulting in a marginal success. Suliman rolls 4 (4 dice) at a difficulty of 8:  2 7 (10) -1- Achieving 0 successes, resulting in a failure Cornelius rolls 4 (4 dice) at a difficulty of 6:  5 2 2 2 Achieving 0 successes, resulting in a failure The demon's mouth closes on Suli's hand and he growls, roars and drops the detonators to grab the closing jaw and hold it up. "Help!" he hisses. Jumpstart rolls 5 (5 dice) at a difficulty of 8:  6 (10) 5 3 2 Achieving 1 successes, resulting in a marginal success. Vanguard-Walker jumps forward to grab the demon jaw, top and bottom, in an effort to pry them open. (OOC) Jumpstart says, "...and there was an earthquake when he landed." (OOC) StormcrowSTandsAlone says, "Heh." Zoe hears the hiss, her head turning to look back at the others to see what's happening before turning back to warn Jumpstart, eyes widening. Hands tighten around the rifle, her gaze cautiously glancing around. StormcrowSTandsAlone rolls strength (7 dice) at a difficulty of 6:  (8) (10) (7) (6) 5 4 2 Achieving 4 successes, resulting in an exceptional success! CLANK. Jumpstart's big, /very/ big -- but fast enough. No snappyhand for him. ((NEENER, FUCKER!)) Jumpy's door, however, remains closed. StormcrowSTandsAlone growls and moves to help Suli. He manages to pry the damn thing open, and as he does Suili's hand comes free and the door clicks open. ((Give me two people on this one.)) He moves to the other door, and sticks his own hand in to open it as soon as Jumpstart and someone else are in position. (OOC) StormcrowSTandsAlone says, "that was me. sorry." Suliman snarls a bit in saying, "Thanks." He stoops to retrieve his explosives and growls, "Let's go." He then shoves open the door. Jumpstart spits on the door, and then his massive paws lock upon the demon jaw, even though he shakes his head. ((I /could/ attempt a little magic... Maybe the Gauntlet's too tough, though.)) (OOC) StormcrowSTandsAlone says, "Guys? There's some confusion. Vanguard was on the door, but I didnt' see it. what're you doing, V-W?" Vanguard-Walker jumps forward to grab the demon jaw, top and bottom, in an effort to pry them open. Petra keeps the shotgun leveled, eyes narrowed, anger in her gaze.  (OOC) Vanguard-Walker says, "You made the roll, it's good. Let's not backtrack." (OOC) StormcrowStandsAlone says, "I didn't make a roll yet - that was to free Suliman's hand, not the other door. :)" Clipped Ear enters from the street. Clipped Ear has arrived. (OOC) Clipped Ear is going to roll for stealth. "What would be a good difficulty? :) (OOC) Vanguard-Walker says, "I Was with Suliman wasn't I? Me & Petra?"   (OOC) StormcrowStandsAlone says, "were're in the main room stil" (OOC) Cornelius says, "No one has left the room yet." (OOC) Cornelius says, "Suli's door is open. The other is not. WHo is going to open the other door? Just indicate it to me." (OOC) StormcrowStandsAlone says, "I am." (OOC) StormcrowStandsAlone says, "That's what I was trying to convey, sorry." (OOC) Clipped Ear says, "Would diff 4 or 5 be alright with everyone? Considering how small and unnoticible I am?" (OOC) Cornelius says, "5 is fine."

Cornelius rolls 2 (2 dice) at a difficulty of 6:  (10) 3 Achieving 1 successes, resulting in a marginal success. There are loud thumps as Storms and Jump bash against the door. It cracks a bit in the middle but it manages to hold against the force of their blows. The leering demon face seems to mock them.  The bum stands against the wall, over by the door, slouching in a patently James Dean kinda way... if James Dean looked like Jack Palance with a mullet. Arcane energies drift and weave their way around him, making him hard to spot by anyone actually looking for him, never mind those engaged in para-military activities. The cam-corder in his hand, silently recording in to a next-generation flash-ROM.  StormcrowStandsAlone rolls perception+alertness (5 dice) at a difficulty of 8:  3 3 7 -1- 5 Achieving -1 successes, resulting in a botch!

(OOC) Clipped Ear says, "And if someone could page me the scene, I'd appreciate it. :)" (OOC) Zoe shall page. Quiet pages: What is your Willpower? Your sheet doesn't have it. Clipped Ear pages: Arcane, right? Whats the diff to spot you. I've been sent in to recon so I'm looking around. p quiet = 6 You paged Quiet with '6'. You paged Clipped Ear with 'Arcane 5. Standard diff +5'. Clipped Ear pages: Whats would say would be the standard diff in this situation? You paged Clipped Ear with '4+5=9'. (OOC) StormcrowStandsAlone says, "Right. screw this." -----------------------[ Wiznote: #5 on Clipped Ear ]-----------------------  Rat Stats  Strength -1 (1), Dexterity +2 (5), Stamina +2 (5), Perception +3 (6), Stealth +2 (6). This form also has the ability to do bite damage.  Set by Banality on Wed Feb 04 02:25:58 2004  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jumpstart leans into the door still more, staring at the demon face, as though he wills it to give way. Which, of course, doesn't work. Hell, he even leans so much that his own feet slip out from under him, and he skids down to one knee. ((Oofda.)) Clipped Ear rolls Perception+alertness+3 (8 dice) at a difficulty of 9:  6 8 2 7 4 4 3 (9) Achieving 1 successes, resulting in a marginal success. Petra rolls Perception+empathy (7 dice) at a difficulty of 6:  2 3 (8) -1- (9) (9) (6) Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success. StormcrowStandsAlone takes out some of the detcord he's carrying and calmly frames the door, attaching a detenator. (( Get back.)) Quiet pages: You get a very clear, very compelling command in your mind to drop the camera and leave the museum at once. Zoe watches, then as Storm starts to set the detcord, she begins to move back even before he says anything. Petra steps back when commanded, silent. Focused. Stone-faced. She's not saying anything, just holding that shotgun. Suliman steps out of the way himself. Now at last he decides to change, slipping into a form similar to the others. StormcrowStandsAlone says, "((Change in plans. When I blow this. Everyone do this gallery first. Haul /ass/ - I want charges on every one of the villans as quickly as possible." Suliman's form blurs and a new shape steps forward. Of course, growling is not American English, nor the Queen's. But Jumpstart sure understands, too. He more or less shields the women, although they can still shoot around him and stuff. Yeah, stuff. Unseen, a little rat slips into the building, squeezing under the door perhaps. He sticks to the shadows, scurrying around as he takes in whats going on, his alert little eyes dancing over the room and its occupents. When he sees the.. werewolves? He freezes in place. When Suliman goes wolfish as well, he just stares. Jesus. You paged Quiet with 'How did Petra detect me? (Arcane 5)'. (OOC) Khinjaar Arramil says, "Wolfish?!" (OOC) Clipped Ear says, "Well.. you said similar. :p" (OOC) Zoe giggles.. try kitty, Clipped. (OOC) Clipped Ear says, "Oh. Boy!" That little rodent stare gets even wider as he notices that is indeed not a wolf.. but a cat. He doesn't stick around for much longer, running back the way he came and slipping out under the door. OOC) Clipped Ear heads out. "Everyone okay with that?" OOC) Zoe laughs and nods. OOC) StormcrowStandsAlone says, "sure." OOC) Petra nodnods. Zoe rolls alertness+perception (5 dice) at a difficulty of 8:  3 9 2 3 7 Achieving 1 successes, resulting in a marginal success. Clipped Ear leaves the waxworks. Clipped Ear has left. Quiet pages: With a ridiculous roll against a very high difficulty. You paged Quiet with 'Fine.'. Quiet pages: It's the way the dice crumble. I'm sorry. There is a sound of an explosion as the door goes when the charge explodes. Splinters fly everywhere. That which remains of the door is on fire but it is easily passable now. Zoe grabs a few charges, and then readies herself to help once the door is blown to run inside and set them before getting out as quickly as possible as Storm says.  Compton packs up and leaves as quietly as he came. Popping the data-chip in to his pocket and strangley leaving the camera on a ledge as he leaves.  Petra pages: He did not follow the command. You paged Quiet with 'No worries.'. You paged (Quiet, Petra) with 'You get a very clear, very compelling command in your mind to drop the camera and leave the museum at once." Camera left, and Compton gone.'. To (Compton, Quiet), Petra pages: Whatever. Be a twink. You paged (Quiet, Petra) with 'Nice. Have it your way. Isn't like the scene is worth anything. Sorry Quiet.'.
