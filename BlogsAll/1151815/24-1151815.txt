         Ruins of Novus Valnastium -- Council Chamber       This chamber used to be vast, even more so than the remains of the hall outside. Amidst all the rubble marring its ancient perfection is an almost perfectly preserved marble table at the head with nine preserved chairs, each with a single, golden Sphere glyph; the remains of what used to be a perfect certamen circle in the center; and the wooden remains of many chairs, now nothing but rotted sticks and boards. A single door and the chamber beyond still stands to the left, glowing a soft gold.         The great marble table has been split along a radius directly to the center, which has been hollowed out. A new wooden chair sits quietly in the middle of the damage, another golden glyph shining quietly on its back.                                  >                                  Contents: Hana Aaron Alexandre Abel Tal Rhiamon James Alyx Siomen Kasui Jonah Obvious exits: Left Door    Out      Abel listens to Aaron then turns to respond to him.

"It is good to see you again, Kawakami-san. It has been quite a while."  Hana bows casually, but in the innately formal manner of the Japanese. About 45 degrees, and then she goes back to peeling her orange, and glancing around. She's never seen so many people around here, it bears examination.  Siomen stands and makes his way over to the chair or matter, he sits down and starts to open his backpack.  Alexandre shifts where he stands next to Rhiamon. Then, he sits down on the ground next to her, crossing his legs. Might be a while.  Tal pulls a large manilla envelope out of his duster and sets it on his lap.  Aaron smirks and nods to Abel, continuing to speak in soft tones as to not disturb the meeting  Rhiamon nods to Alexandre. "Jane's not going to make it, but I bear her sigil.."  Aaron whispers to Abel.  Jet enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Jet has arrived. Jet shuffles in  Hana finds a fragmnet of wall to lean against. Since she has yet to be asked to leave, she decides to stay.  Rhiamon smiles from her rubble-seat by the Forces chair. "Jet!"  Abel listens to Aaron and laughs just a little... softly.  Aaron's gaze turns as he hears Jat's name called and he raises his hand to wave to her from his seat by Abel  Alexandre sits by Rhiamon, crosslegged on the ground. He looks up at the entrance as Rhiamon calls out. He smiles as well and waves her over.  Jet looks around at Rhiamon's voice and smiles brilliantly! "Rhia, dahling, so good to see you." She heads over toward the Seat of Forces, with a cheery wave for Aaron along the way.  This room has been partially restored. Piles of carved stone can be seen beyond the walls, which seem to be rebuilding themselves gradually and slowly, as everyone speaks. Rubble has been cleared, debris swept away, new chairs brought in. The room is slowly, slowly coming together again, as if defiant of the ages and determined to be as it once was. (LOOK here - if you have at least Spirit 1, page Mercutio)  You paged Mercutio with 'Spirit 2.'.  Alyx glances to her side, at Tal, offering the choirester a slight smile before lifting a hand as if to beckon him closer, for quiet talking.  There are no Umbral Aspects here.                 Tal grabs the manilla envelope out of his lap and heads over to Alyx with a curious smile on his face. He leans on the arm of Entropy, "Sup?"  Alyx leans up with a smile on her lips, murmuring to the Choirester.  //.etro: Compton rolls "perception+Awareness" privately to Mercutio at diff 7.          For a total of 1 success(es).  Chase enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Chase has arrived.  Alyx whispers to Tal.  James would be sitting crosslegged on the floor as well, but still filing away at the stone he has.  Tal nods to Alyx and replies in low tones.  Tal whispers to Alyx.  Abel is sitting in the Gallery, watching the ruins rebuild themselves curiously. Aaron sits next to him.  Alyx nods towards Tal, sitting back a little after murmuring a reply.  Walking into the frey, Chase stalks. He already looks pissed and the shit hasn't even begun to fly. Sneakers walk him towards the seat of Correspondence. Harsh looks for Aaron, bloodshot eyes lock on him in passing. Though his gaze fades into a solid sneer in general as he takes his seat. The chewing gum bubble he *pops* lets those that know him, know it the real Chase and not some robot.  Alyx whispers to Tal.  Aaron meets Chase's gaze and smiles, speaking again softly to Abel  Aaron whispers to Abel. Tal reaches up and squeezes Alyx' hand with a smile before walking across the table again passing from Entropy to Prime once more. He sits at his appointed seat and folds his hands in his lap over the manilla folder.  Siomen just sits quietly, playing with Geero on his lap, geero still tucked away in the backpack. Seat of Matter never contested.  Abel frowns a little and shakes his head as Aaron speaks. Then he whispers back.  Jonah gradually makes his way into the Council Chambers. A soft click of his wooden cane preceeds each step, and a briefcase is held in his other hand. He takes his time walking through toward the Seat of Forces, quietly, saying nothing to anyone as he drifts through the room.  Abel whispers to Aaron.  Aaron shakes his head to Abel and replies to the man's soft words  Aaron whispers to Abel, "... tried... a..."  Abel nods and speaks softly back.  Jet murmurs to Rhiamon and Alexandre  Abel whispers to Aaron.  Mercutio pages: You see small spirits drifting back and forth through the ruins, carrying stone and mortar. There are a dozen of them, all working toward restoration of the room.  Prepared for unpleasantries, Chase leans back in the chair of Correspondence and kicks his sneakers onto the table one over the other. *Pop* Cynical.  Mercutio has arrived.  Tal is looking around in amused amazement and chuckling softly.  Alyx likewise sits back, though without putting her feet up, hands clasped on the tabletop, leather gloves squeaking a little.  Hana still leans against a wall in the back, eating her orange.  Compton watches the debris clean itself it. Brow krinkled in cofusion or wonder as he gazes out in to the mid point in the room. His head panning and his eyes darting, following somthing elusive.  Siomen just sits quietly and looks up as jonah enters, he nods as he casually tickles geero's stomach Aaron whispers to Abel, "... keep... doesn't..."  Kasui suddenly blinks, tilting her head to one side as she murmurs quietly, "Oro?" Her amber gaze seems to ollow somehting... just beyond view, like she is watching an invisibel parade.  Aaron whispers to Abel.  Abel listens to Aaron and nods, frowning a little, then turns to whisper to him again.  Jonah reaches the Seat of Forces, pulling it out from the table slightly. He sets his briefcase down on the tabletop. "Good morning, everyone," he says, his voice full and loud enough for all to hear. "If you would, please take a seat and pull it near to the table.  Abel whispers to Aaron, "... spearheading..." Alexandre stops whispering as he looks to Jonah, ready to listen.  Abel stands and grabs a chair, starting to head closer to the table with it.  Rhiamon stands, and fetches a chair for herself and Jet, placing them to one side of Jonah. Hana remains stationary.  Compton shuffles forward in his soggy footwear and sits down in one of the seats. Then doing the chair scooch along the rock floor. The heavy chair making a loud squeak with each inch it budges.   >  Alyx looks up and over to Jonah, fingers lifting to remove her reading glasses so she can focus on him properly.  James puts his stone, and file away, remaining where he is already seated.  Alexandre sits up, grabs a chair, sits to the same side of Jonah as Rhiamon and Jet. Without the speaking.  Siomen winces at all the noise, he sighs and remains where he is, close enough for his purposes, Geero beeping a couple times before shushed by its maker.  Chase doesn't shift from his chair, save the absent flexing of his square jaw on some gum.  Jet sits next to Rhiamon and Alexandre.  Rhiamon sneaks a small finger wave to Geero.  Geero hops up and manages to escape Siomen's grasp, he toddles over to Rhiamon. Kasui remins, of course, upon the Seat of Mind, her momentary distraction fading as she focuses her full attention upon Jonah.  Jonah casts a quiet, dicerning glance amongst everyone collected. "I fail to believe that this is everyone, but very well." He opens his briefcase and begins to remove some papers, placing them on the table adjacent the case. "If I have everyone's attention," with that, he spares a glance to everyone again, "I would like to call this meeting to order."  Abel sits back down and pulls his sun symbol on it's chain out from under his shirt, then lets is hang again. Siomen pulls out Cally's recording device and turns it on with a smile. he keeps an eye on Geero.  Abel's turns to see of Aaron haas followed him over then turns his attention to Jonah.  Rhiamon reaches down, and scoops Geero up, cradling him on her lap, so he can see.  Tal stops glancing about at the open air and turns his attention to Jonah.  Jet smiles at Geero, then looks up and winks at Siomen.  Siomen smiles back to jet and dips his head.  Alyx simply continues to watch Jonah, attention unwavering.  "My first order of business today was actually not on my agenda." Jonah retrieves a typed letter from the top of his neatly stacked papers. He places a pair of reading glasses over his nose. "It seems that Mr. Alex Hess has caused quite a stir with the Mr. Michaels situation." A brief glance is given to Aaron, followed by Chase and then Abel. "I do not validate this change in agreement off-hand. I suggest that you, Mr. Kettle, speak with Mr. Hess and determine an appropriate means to recover this situation. I will speak with Mr. Michaels myself at a later time. This matter /will/ be settled, however there are other agendas which currently take priority."  Compton does so, likewise. Being old enough to actually pay attention for extended periods.  Chase nods fervently. "I intend to." And that's he'll say at the moment. *Pop*  Siomen listens and frowns, wondering about the problem.  Tal tucks that bit away for later reference, doesn't concern him in particular.  Jet listens with apparent attention.  Abel nods to Jonah. "Of course, MAgister."  Attention wavering briefly, Alyx plucks a quarter-sized coin from the cuff of one of her sleeves, beginning to absently roll it along her knuckles.  Rhiamon looks curiously at Aaron, and tilts her head.  Jonah places the letter back in his briefcase, which is gently pushed to the side. "Right. Our next order of business is the development of the Earthside Chantryhouse. I have located several appropriate locations on the north side of town. So far, the most promising of the two is near an old, abandoned manorhouse called Lebrentis Manor. It is a slight distance out of town, though I feel that is a better decision than keeping it in town." He looks up from his papers, "Thoughts, comments, objections?"  Siomen tilts his head "Will this be a place to bring new members for introduction before introducing them to the realm? i still have a member wandering out there who hasn't been introduced to the rest of you, because i don't know who to bring him to without having him yelled at or worse attacked if i bring him here.  Not a word from the chair of Correspondence. Chase scratches under his chin lazily. Seems he's no particular thoughts pertinent to the location of the earth side Chantry.  Alyx lifts her chin slightly, lifting a gloved hand to indicate that she has a question, though not interrupting Siomen's question.  Kasui speaks up in a resonant, respectful, contralto as se finishes inking a series of Kanji and Kana to take note for her Sempai. "Sir, I am here representing the head of Dharma's Tear and the Seat of Mind in his absence due to pressing business. I do not know Kaze-sempai's thoughts on this subject, but my own is that there should be some means of hidden transit to the site. A park area liek this present entrance is public enough not to attract scrutiny if large numbers of people pass inexplicably through. However, a manor, or private residence, will attract attention due to too much traffic even if it is logically more secure a locale."  The Invisible College's lone representitive, Compton, maintains his silence.  Jet says, "I'm willing to volunteer my house, but I suspect the Union is aware of it, so I'm not sure it's a good choice. I have no real evidence that they are watching it, but it's not impossible. And I agree with the Chair of Mind that a place without regular mundane traffic can be found by traffic analysis if precautions are not taken."  Hana continues to simply listen and watch, in somewhat bemused silence.  James listens quietly.  Tal hmms quietly, "What about Casa Loma? Is it possible to move the gate somewhere inside it? It should not be impossible to bypass the security on such a large structure. There is quite a bit of tourist traffic in and out of it and its in downtown. We may not be able to have total control over the building, but if we are going to gain resources from New England, it shouldn't be too difficult to gain rooms as a 'historical society' or the like."  Abel looks to Tal at the seat of Prime to see what his ractions are.  Tal adds, "It also has the benefit of being a place considered to be odd by Sleepers, which is a mark in its favor."  Rhiamon listens, stroking Geero's head absently.  Jet says, "Do we have a group who can move the gate, in fact?"  Jonah looks over to Hana momentarily, his head cocking to one side. Studying her, he offers a smile. "Yes, yes you did. You are Kawakami Hanami, am I correct?"  Hana offers a compulsive bow, a shallow one but one perhaps in assent.  Siomen sighs as his question goes unanswered for yet another little while, he sits back and stays quiet.  Abel looks over at Hana then turns to Jet. "If the gate needs to be moved, I believe my Mentor and brother, Father Dismas, can help.  Chase says, "I can assist as well."  Jonah looks away from her. "I believe Casa Loma is too public. I liken it to Allan Gardens, personally, in its accesibility." He looks to Jet, "As for your house, Miss Levantine, I would prefer to find someplace more neutral than the existing house of a Hermetic. This Chantryhouse is for all, not just for us." He shuffles through some papers again, "As for Mr. Rutherford's question - yes, this place will both house the new Gateway and serve as an earthly location where new arrivals may be introduced and interviewed before allowed access to the Realm."  Jet says, "Public has certain advantages... in terms of hiding among normal traffic."  Siomen nods and smiles "Expect Jack 'lucky' London to visit soon then" James raises his hand.  Alyx's hand remains raised, green eyes fixed upon the magister that leads the council.  Hana seems more bemused by the fact that yet another stranger knows who she is, but lets the conversation move on past her, listening once more.  Abel turns to the unmoved Aaron and raises an eyebrow to him, inquizzitively, then turns back to the proceedings at hand.  Jonah guestures across the table to Alyx. "Yes, Miss Davian?"  Aaron keeps his seat in the Gallery and just watches the proceedings from whee he is. For those that know him, his silence and decorum might seem unsettling.  "What are the merits of this suburban house, Guru? I am still unfamiliar with much of Toronto; what kind of area is it in, and of the house itself, what of it's size and accessability?" Alyx inquires softly. "Also, what will be kept there, other than new recruits and the gateway?"  Jonah responds, "The merits of a suburban house are manyfold. It is in a private location, north of the city a few miles. The manorhouses there are large estates and very well separated. Privacy being the key, this location will serve well. The House is fairly large, and will be accessible to any who belong to the Chantry at any time they wish to be present. I am working on a security system which will likely consist of watchers at the gates who will likely control the 'automatic' gates." Thinking for another moment, he continues, "We will have the gateway at this location, as well as a centralized database with which we may better communicate. Also, the Chantry's new Library will partially exist in the Earthside structure."  Abel raises a hand to speak.  Jonah says, "Yes, Mr. Elison?"  James lowers his hand.  "Oh, one moment, Mr. Elison," Jonah says, "I apologize. You may speak, Mr...?"  Abel nods and waits. "Of Course."  James says, "Anderson. What would the merits of say a building on Campus, or an anex of the public library be?"  James says, "Since people suggested a semi public localle"  Jonah furrows his brow. "Well, they would be easily accessible, and I agree that public locales would be less obvious. However, a public locale is much more difficult to defend, and the ease of accessibility makes it possible for accidental entrance to the Realm through it's Shallowing. I am surprised that such a thing has never occured here."  Alyx lifts her hand once more. Jonah nods to Alyx, then looks to Abel. "Mr. Elison, then Miss Davian."  Abel stands. "Thank you Magister." He looks around the room. "I think we need to keep in mind that the Mirrorshades don't only know where the gateway is currently, but that they know -Us-. I know they know me. Neither Ms. Cixi nor Mr. Palmerton are happy with my petition and have told me so. They will find the Chantry. Is it possible to have doorways from multiple locations? All opening to the realm and from there to the chantry house? I don't want to have Hyperion's eyes follow me then bring them here by mistake."  Kasui 's hand stills in note taking for a moment as she raises it to next gain the attention of Jonah for th epurpose of speaking. Her amber eyes focus upon Abel as she listens otherwise quietly.  Kasui 's hand stills in note taking for a moment as she raises it to next gain the attention of Jonah for th epurpose of speaking. Her amber eyes focus upon Abel as she listens otherwise quietly. (re) Aaron smirks to himself and crosses his arms over his chest, leaning back in his seat in the Gallerly and putting his feet up on the chair in front of him as he continues to watch in that odd silent way of his "I don not fear the Mirrorshades, Mr. Elison," Jonah replies, confident. "This is a war. Each side possesses information about the other. That is not only acceptable, but it is to be expected. The purpose of moving the gateway is to better protect it - as it stands, it has little to no protection whatsoever. I am not afraid of being known insomuch as I am afraid of the Realm being taken."  Chase nods at Jonah's words. Slightly shifting in his chair, he chimes in support. "Here here."  Abel nods once to Jonah, then sits.  Jonah says, "Miss Davian?"  Tal nods in agreement with Jonah and shrugs in Abel's direction.  Abel shrugs back to Tal.  Alyx dosen't stand, though does lower her hand once addressed. "How /do/ you intend to protect the realm gateway, Guru? All the locks in the world are unlikely to stop the enemy if they decide they will intrude." Jonah suddenly blinks. "Oh. I apologize. One moment, Miss Davian." He looks back to Abel. "Multiple doorways are not out of the question. However, we will have one, to begin, and we can build others as we see fit, as long as they are properly secured." Then, without a pause, he turns to Alyx, "The gateway will be protected in many steps. Mundane guards, mundane security systems, magickal wards, and spirit guardians. The realm itself is already protected by five Guardians and their twenty lesser guardians."  Abel nods to Jonah.  Alyx inclines her head slightly to the magister's answer and returns to idly flipping her coin, never pausing to check which way it lands.  Jonah passes his gaze to Kasui, guesturing. "Miss Suzuno?"  Kasui nods once, tapping her papers agaisnt the table to straighten them as she stands smoothly to speak. "Firstly, I concurr that security is neve full proof or unbreakable. I have personal experience in that matter. That does not mea, however, it should nto be used for the purpose it is intended." Apparentlys omeone ha been sudying their english pretty hard. "Thatbeing, to slow an enemy down long enough to face the incursion or escape it. Secondly, I simply wanted to add to the list of possible measures, that we have multiple entrances to any gateway. Two or more. It will take more security to defend, but, simply, it will serve to spread our own entrants accross a broader range and timeframe while simultaneously allowing us more than one means of escape from our own den."  Jonah just nods, "As I said, other entrances are acceptable, but in due time. I am more concerned with moving the existing entrance before we work to create more." Kaze appears standing silently behind the Seat of Mind, one moment nothing and the next there he quietly stands like a Shadow behind where Kasui is seated. Having come late his entrance is soundless and indeed might go unnoticed unless you were looking in Kasui's direction at the time. Kasui ndos once, "I wish, then, to offer my services in construction of any material entrances, tunnels, or the like if needed. My skills with External Alchemy are my mystical Forte', even if I am only a disciple. Thank you, Magister." Catchng Kaze's presence out of the corner of he reye, she blinsk once and then bows to ehr Sempai before handing him her stack of calligraphied notes and stepping aside for him to occupy the seat.  Jet says, "Oh how interesting... perhaps you could give a seminar"  ********************************************************************** Penny skinrides Compton at this point. Sad thing is she gets more XP for Comp in one scene than I have. Bitch.  **********************************************************************  James listens quietly, a thoughtful expression on his face.  Jonah looks about for a moment, offering a bow to Kaze when he appears. Again, he passes a gaze to everyone, then finally he speaks. "We still have the matter of location. Personally, I prefer a non-public locale, such as the Manor. It is accessible to us without being accessible by others, it is more easily defended. However, it may not be accessible to all on an equal basis, and it may be more obvious. A public locale is easily accessible to everyone and is less obvious, though that ease of accessibility is also a downfall, as is the lack of effective security."  Alex enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Alex has arrived. Abel gets a blank look on his face at the mention of external alchemy, then seems to understand and settles back into his place. Alex steps into the council chambers, pausing just inside the door, to take a moment to look around....  Hana leans against bthe wall next to the doorway, apart from the group gathered around the table.  At Alex's arrival, Chase turns his head to stare at the man. *Pop* There's no greeting in his bloodshot eyes.  Jesyca enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Jesyca has arrived. Jesyca tries to quietly walk into the meeting, looking rather sheepish at arriving so late.  Hana offers a quiet greeting, though. "Hi Alex.."  Kaze returns Jonah's bow before moving gracefully to take over the Seat of Mind vacated by Kasui, taking her notes in hand and looking them over as he sits there listening for the moment.  Abel seems to have pulled a chair from the gallery closer to the table. Occasionally he looks back to the gallery to where Aaron is sitting. Around the room, the chantry seems to be slowly rebuilding itself.  Alex moves to take a seat in the gallery. A small nod is given to Hana in response to her greeting.  Jonah glances to Alex as he enters, then looks over to Chase. "Mr. Kettle, unless you have an immediate opinion on the current matter, I will excuse you so that you may speak with Mr. Hess."  Jet smiles at Aaron.  Chase stands at Jonah's words, nodding. Knuckles flex and his sneakers start him towards Mr. Hess with bad intention. A snap of his callused fingers, he point at Alex and gestures for him to follow the punk into the chamber beyond.  Jesyca walks over towards Abel, green eyes drifting over towards Aaron a moment and then back towards Abel.  Kaze's gaze wanders meaningfully towards Chase, Alex, and the Magister for a moment but returns to the notes not long after breezing through the calligraphy like it was english.  Abel smiles up at Jes warmly, offering her a hand, then leans in to whiper to her. Abel whispers to Jesyca.  Alex stops just before he sits, his head turning slightly in Chase's direction at the snap of his fingers. A frown creases his brow and he pauses, definantly it would seem, before following Chase, casually, into the other chamber.  Chase steps back out to the main hall. Chase has left.  Tal steps back out to the main hall. Tal has left.  Jesyca steps back out to the main hall. Jesyca has left. Jesyca enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Jesyca has arrived.  Kasui stands, now, completely silent at KAze's side. She seems, almost, to simply be an ornament with as still as she stands, her hands olded beneath the billowy sleeves of her kimono.  Tal enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Tal has arrived.  Alex steps back out to the main hall. Alex has left.  Abel turns to Jonah. "I see no problem with a private Chantry at the Location you suggest Magister. I think a private entrance is best."  Jesyca quietly kneels down onto her knees by Abel, letting the dark material of her cloak spill out on the ground around her.  Jonah says, "All in favor of a private Chantryhouse?"  Rhiamon holds up her hand, "Mercuria and I would also prefer a private entrance." The hand she raises holds a ring.  Cassius nods, "I am, Magister."  Hana's growing bored with things, and tired as well. Tilting her head back she rubs her neck and looks up at the ceiling, if there is one.  Tal nods, "I am, Magister."  Kaze raises one hand slightly, "Hai." he says loud enough to be heard actually looking up from the notes now to answer.  Alyx does not raise her hand, though she dosen't seem particularly opposed to the decision. kset Are we for ro against it?   Jesyca nods her head agreeing with Abel and Tal.  James raises his hand and waits to be counted before lowering it again.  Jonah counts all the affirmative votes, then says, "All opposed? Speak now or forever hold your peace."  Rhiamon lowers her hand.  Compton reaches inside the pocket on his loud shirt and pulls out what looks like a postit note. Opening it he pauses and says in his gravelly voice he states with some authority, "The Invisible College does not support this action."  Geero beeps softly and reaches a hand to the ring in Rhia's hand. She smiles at him, but puts it safely out of his way.  Alyx lifts her hand slowly, though remains silent on the matter.  Jonah looks over to Compton, curiously, while still watching and counting. "Do you mind if I ask why the Invisible College does not support this?"  Tal sighs gently and shakes his head with a smirk.  Abel looks over at Tal, sighing a bit.  Compton visibly pinks around the ears at this question. Obviously he wasn't expecting to actually have to talk about anything, "I, well, um..." he gets going witha rough start, "I, I mean we think we should stay inside the city... Around the masses. A subtle urban locale allows us to hide in plain sight."  Tal asks gently, "Um, you guys wouldn't be disagreeing out of habit, would you?" He smiles at Compton, slightly amused.  Abel turns to Compton as well. "Do you guys have a better suggestion?"  Jonah nods, slowly, while still watching Compton. "Yes, I do understand that." He waves a respectfully dismissive hand at Tal, "No, he presents a valid point. It would be less obvious if we were in the city. I will note the objections of the Invisible College as valid and consider them in my final determination. However, as it currently stands, the ayes have it."  Rhiamon reaches into her bag, holding Geero steady with one hand as she listens, and fishes out a small gilt chain which she drapes carefuly round his neck, careful that it dosen't get caught in any of his gears, then goes back to gently scratching his stomach area.  Tal looks as if he suspects otherwise, "True, Magister. He does raise a good point." He inclines his head respectfully to Compton.  Jonah reaches down and retrieves a pen, actually writing something down on a fresh sheet of paper. A moment, and he guestures to Alyx, "Miss Davian, your objection, for the record?"  Compton crumples his little postit, and sits back again visibly relaxing. Quietly he slips a tiny paper bag warpped bottle from his pants and takes a sip. Those close enough might get a wiff of diesel fuel for some odd reason.  Hana tilts her chin down again, looking for a long moment at Jonah, then at Compton, and finally back again. "Doesn't it all depend on who you're hiding from?" she says, her English perfect, but accented. "I mean, that is what matters, when choosing an advantageous location from which to fight...or to hide. The capabilities of the enemy always...come under consideration.  Allowing her hand to drop, once she's been noticed, Alyx murmurs, "I simply dislike all the cloak and dagger, Guru." Perhaps amusing, given her current garb. "While I am painfully aware of the need for secracy, this sounds far more like the 'secret house' of a 'secret club' who have 'secret meetings' and passwords and all the rest that goes with such childish behaviours. Something like the current arrangement at the zoo, where the only 'secret' is location, I find far more to my taste. It is only a personal dislike, however, and I do not speak for my Tradition when I say it."  Abel turns to Tal, a questioning look on his face and mouths 'Zoo?'  Jesyca leans up a bit to speak to Abel. She whispers to Abel, "I..."   Tal shrugs to Abel, he looks at a loss himself.  James frowns thoughtfully  Abel blinks and turns down to Jes.  Aaron has, for his part, remained quiet and rather polite as he sits in the Gallery. ot once having offered an opinion or even a single word to the topics discussed.  Abel whispers to Jesyca.  Kaze finishes the entirety of the notes while still seemingly giving his meeting his full attention and arranges them neatly in front of him on the table looking from one speaker to another not yet choosing to say his own piece.  Jesyca speaks quietly back towards him, She whispers to Abel, "... things... tell.... target..."  kset Sure, so we can do 3 times as much nothing? :P  Abel hmms and nods to Jes, then leans down to her.  Abel whispers to Jesyca, "... mask you."  Jonah nods slowly, first to Hana and then to Alyx. "I understand your objections and will note them, Miss Davian." To which, he does just that. Silence passes the next few moments, interrupted only by the soft breeze and the eerie sound of the walls being rebuilt all around. Finally, "Miss Kawakimi, our enemy is that of the Technocratic Union. From what I understand, you know little of the threats which exist to us, though there are some who would be willing to teach you. Our enemy is powerful and organized."  Jesyca gives a quiet bow of her head towards Abel growing silent once more.  Aaron leans back softly and seems to close his eyes, settling into a comfortable position.  This statement has Hana's attention.  Abel seems to think of something then raises his hand, while looking down at Jes. birthday, here in a bit. Keene enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Keene has arrived.  Alexandre has connected.  Keene comes in, hopefully during a collective pause in the conversation, and moves over to stand or sit nearby Compton.  Jonah glances over to Abel, "Mr. Elison?"  Abel turns to look at Jonah. "Will this place you have in mind still be under the protection from The Storm the Spear of Longinus on top of the CN tower grants us?"  Jonah says, "The effects of the Spear do end at the edges of the city, however the storm does not seem to exist until a decent distance outside the city itself. This location is within the calm zone."  Compton nods over to Keene, getting his flask out for the umpteenth time. He says something to the man and nods at Jonah at the same time.  Abel nods.  Compton mutters to Keene, "... don't think he... what..." You whisper "Slow going, don't think he gives a rat's ass what we do." to Keene.  Somehow, Keene knew he would come in just as talk of the Spear of Destiny began. This is why his Valium-blood level is at a nice, optimal level. He moves, sits down next to Compton, and leans in a bit once he starts talking to him. He gives no audible reply; instead, he inclines his head once, pats Compton on the shoulder, and offers him a cigarette from his breast pocket. Meanwhile, with his other hand, he takes out a legal pad and pen from inside of his coat.  Jonah looks over to Compton and Keene for a moment. He offers a nod of greeting to Keene, then looks back to his notes. "Very well. On the motion to determine the location of the new Earthside Chantryhouse, we have voted that it shall be a private location, outside of the city. I will review this decision and notes taken regarding it and announce a resolution within the next few days." He scribbles something onto this piece of paper, then turns it over and places it in his briefcase. A new sheet withdrawn, he looks to everyone. "Now, we will begin collecting a list of those interested in being part of this Chantry. I will begin by recording the names of the existing Cabals and their members, and then I shall go to those who are not currently part of a cabal and record their names."  Compton slips two fingers into his left-breast pocket, trading cigarettes with him offering a light on the heels of the gesture. Choking a little on his first drag, Compton hacks and snorts his way through Johah's summary.  Abel turns to Tal.  Keene takes Compton's offered cigarette in a smooth movement, putting it between his lips as he catches   Jonah's nod. He returns the gesture politely, then lights up the cigarette with his usual black Zippo. Meanwhile, with his other hand, he starts writing on his legal pad.  Tal nods to Abel then turns his attention to Jonah, waiting for him.  Chase enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Chase has arrived.  Alex enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Alex has arrived. Alex follows Chase into the council chambers and heads back over to the chair he was about to sit in before he was called out to the other chamber to speak with Chase.  Jonah guestures to Tal, who currently occupies the Seat of Prime. "Starting with the Seat of Prime, we shall go 'round the table, collecting the names of Cabals and their members. If you are not a part of a cabal, please pass until we return to you." He looks to Tal, expectantly.  Tal begins, "I, Taliesin Emrys, am a member of the Beacon in the Dark. Abel Elison is also a member as are my two apprentices, Millia McMillan and Jesyca Petrovich."  Jonah writes this information down as it is given to him. Moments pass, then he looks to Kaze, in the Seat of Mind. "Seat of Mind is next."  Kaze waits until Tal has finished and then speaks himself, "I, Shinketsu Kaze, lead the Cabal Dharma's Tear. Both of my Kohai, Mizuno Kasui and Tian Shi Chou are also members."  Jonah again scribbles this down, moving on. "The Seat of Spirit is Vacant, we move on to the Seat of Matter." (is Siomen in it, but idle?)  Chase now reoccupies the seat of Correspondence in relative silence. Though his tech vest makes some noises one would associate with teflon armor as he resettles. *Pop*  Jonah notes down the members of Team Ether, then moves to the next seat. "Next is this Seat, the Seat of Forces. As I am only a temporary representative, I shall turn to Miss Jones for input."  Jonah notes down the members of Team Ether, then moves to the next seat. "Next is this Seat, the Seat of Forces. As I am only a temporary representative, I shall turn to Miss Jones for input." (repose)  Keene sits quietly, taking notes as Jonah speaks.  Abel remains quiet as the cabals are announced, offering his hand for Jes to hold, smiling down at her.  Rhiamon clears her throat, and looks to the other two by her, "The Turris Scientiae cabal is formed of myself, Holly Levantine, Alexandre Taylor and Jane Smith. Viktor might also be joining us."  Jet murmurs to Alexandre and Rhiamon  Jonah nods, passing on as he continues to write. "The Seat of Life is currently unrepresented, as is the Seat of Time. I know who represents both and have received word from both, however, and thus will take note of such later. Now, we move on to the Seat of Correspondence." His glance goes to Chase.  "After-Math consists of myself, Alex Hess, Maisri MacKenzie, and will be receiving a new field operator and acolyte from a different chapter in the coming weeks. Also, we''l receive a new member pending on a discussion which will take place after this meeting." Chase says with a slight smirk, punctuating his statement with a small flinch under his left eye. After he states his piece, he leans back in chair and kicks his feet up again.  Rhiamon murmurs quietly to her cabal-mates.  Abel quirks an eyebrow.  Aaron finally speaks from the Gallery, "Don't count on it, Kettle.."  Jonah just ignores this, noting down what he must, then moving on. "Last at the table is the Seat of Entropy." He looks up to Miss Davian." -"  Alyx smiles pleasently towards Jonah. "I, Alyx Davian, am of no Cabal," she murmurs. "Nor, to my knowledge, is Mr Tullern, who formally occupies this seat, though that is something I would advise you check with him, once he returns."  Aaron, for those recently arriving, is lounging in the Gallery with his head back and his eyes closed. He did not look up when Chase spoke, but simply spoke his mind and remained in place  Jonah nods. "Very well." He glances about to the rest of the people. "Are there any other Cabals not represented by a Seat at present?" The glance falls on Keene and Compton, "The Invisible College?"  Jet says, "Trinity is non-geographical, I'm in that also."  Alex's head turns in Keene and Compton's direction, for a brief moment, before glancing over to the Seat of Spirit.  Tal clears his throat softly, "The Invisible College is represented by Ms. Inscrutable in the Seat of Spirit, Magister."  Abel looks over to the Invisible College members from his seat.  Bloodshot eyes drift towards Jet in an 'aroo?' fashion. Chase shifts, taking his feet off the table. "Say that again?" He prompts the girl.  Jonah looks over at Tal, from him to the Seat of Spirit, and then back to Tal. "Funny, Mr. Emrys, but I see no one currently seated in the Seat of Spirit, thus no one is representing it, and the Invisible College is not, at this time, represented by a seat."  Tal seems about to reply but just shrugs. Apparently Daze never replied.  Compton keeps his mouth shut, defering to Keene taking another drag on his cigarette.  Keene, with a sense of lingering dread, pauses in his writing. He puts down his notepad and gets up, smoothing his tie, then speaking. "The Invisible College itself does not lay claim to a seat at this time. However, I believe that Daisy Inscrutable earlier claimed interest in holding the seat of Spirit. It would be in her hands to affirm or deny that claim now, but she is not present." He smiles thinly. Passing the buck is how Keene gets his cardiovascular exercise.  James looks at Keene and frowns.  Jonah watches Keene, as if that were not the exact answer he was looking for. He speaks, to clarify, "Who is the leader of the Invisible College?"  "I am," says Keene.  Jonah nods, "And as the leader of the Invisible College, do you wish for your Cabal to be a part of this Chantry?"  James looks at Keene and frowns.  Jonah watches Keene, as if that were not the exact answer he was looking for. He speaks, to clarify, "Who is the leader of the Invisible College?"  "I am," says Keene.  Jonah nods, "And as the leader of the Invisible College, do you wish for your Cabal to be a part of this Chantry?"  Keene pauses for a moment, looking over at Compton. Then he returns his attention to Jonah. "Yes, we would like to be part of this Chantry." A simple, unambiguous answer. My God, the world will end.  Jonah blinks, looking up from his paper, where his pen still hovers, waiting. "Very well. And the members of your Chantry, please?"  Abel seems a bit surprised at Keene's response.  Rhiamon has partially disconnected.  Jet says, "Welcome aboard."  "The members of the Invisible College," says Keene, "are Jesse Truant, Penny Ante, Hiro Stace, Daisy Inscrutable, Eric Compton and myself, Steve Keene."  Jet says, "Are those all pseudonyms?"  Alyx resumes absently rolling her silver coin over her knuckles, barely watching it. Abel stretches in his seat a bit, squeezing Jes's hand.  Aaron remains in place in the Gallery, still looking much like he's sleeping  "Stice," Compton corrects, ashes on the floor between his feet.  Jonah looks satisfied, now that the names come out. He notes them down on paper, briefly, and looks up once more. "Any other Cabals not mentioned? If not, we shall begin taking the names of those interested in being part of this Chantry who are not part of a Cabal."  Jesyca smiles up to Abel having been quiet for awhile, that or she may have done like she did the last time she was in one of these meetings. She casts a quick look towards Tal just to make sure.  Keene nods to Compton. "I always mess up his name," he mutters, then sits down once his turn has seemingly passed. He either didn't hear or isn't going to answer Jet's question.  Compton whispers to Keene, "How... charade?"  You whisper "How long do we have to keep up this charade?" to Keene.  Jonah glances up, to Compton. "Charade, Mr. Compton?"  Abel looks over at Compton as well.  Compton says overly loud "Yeah, CHARADES. We have a game scheduled with the local pre-school. We volunteer."  Rhiamon toys absently with Geero's new chain as she listens.  James waits quietly for things to move on.  Jonah frowns sharply, guesturing to Keene, "You asked Mr. Keene how long you had to keep up this charade."  Jonah asks, "What charade?"  Siomen smiles faintly and looks over, he wants to hear this"  This even gets aaron to sit up and take notice, "And they're all after me.....figures.."  Alex chuckles softly at Jonah's questioning of Compton, turning his head slightly in Compton's direction.  Kaze's gaze travels from the Magister to Compton and Keene now, as calm and unphaseable as ever, though he seems interested enough in the question.  Rhiamon holds up a hand, though listening..  Jesyca's green eyes drift up towards Abel and then towards the ground a moment fidgeting with her cloak quietly.  Compton shrugs it off "Look, I'm tired and I've got a cabal member slightly comatose back at our place. She needs me more than you so I've been feigning interest in being here for the sake of the group." He gets up from where he was sitting "May I be excused?"  Abel looks over at Compton's excuse to leave and quirks an eyebrow. Then turns to Tal.  Jonah watches Compton, unconvinced. In fact, he's not even moved since he caught the whispered conversation. "You will forgive me if I do not immediately believe you, Mr. Compton, however I will excuse you. I will speak with you at a later date concerning this issue."  Alex raises an eyebrow at Compton's explaination, doubt plain on his face.  Aaron watches this scene with some interest and arches a brow as Jonah excuses Compton, "Fuck me...", can barely be heard to pass his lips, followed by a soft laugh.  Keene sits back, a neutral expression on his face. He doesn't look over when Compton talks to him, nor does he show any particular response to Jonah's questioning. He puffs on his cigarette, adjusting his glasses. His gaze tracks from Jonah to Compton, where it sits for several seconds. He puffs on his cigarette, rolls his tongue inside of his mouth, and puffs a smoke ring over Compton's head. Then, after a languid moment, he moves his attention back to Jonah. He gets back up.  "Several members of my organization," he says, "dislike that I have chosen to align ourselves with this Chantry. They feel the security in the Chantry is questionable at best," and he looks at Aaron for a long moment before looking back to Jonah, "and that this Realm should be allowed to be destroyed. Fundamentally, they feel several aspects of this Chantry and its operations raise red flags, and that we should consider moving our operations elsewhere to avoid the seemingly inevitable wrath of the Technocracy."  "I," says Keene, "do not feel that way. I feel that under your guidance, Magister, conditions will improve. This Chantry will become safer and better for all of us, and ultimately we will be able to make real progress in the Ascension War. But this has been a hard sell for me to my cabal."  He gestures with his cigarette. "I lead not so much because of the consent of the governed, but because I am simply one of the few people left in the cabal who has faith in the ability of the Order of Hermes to lead us all to a better day. They wish no part of this Chantry -- I, however, have insisted upon it. I trust in your leadership, Magister. Please forgive my colleague's rudeness."  At that, he inclines his head respectfully, then awaits whatever judgement Jonah may pass.   A soft clatter, as Alyx's silver coin is flipped down onto the tabletop, spinning on it's edge before coming to -*+alt on one side. She examines it's fall and nods, scooping the coin up and tucking it back into it's place under the cuff of her gloves, looking then over towards Jonah.  Abel turns and frowns a bit when he hears Aaron, then turns back to Keene.  Siomen sniff softly "Perhaps you should pass the issue to your cabal then.. that if they feel this place has questionable security, then why do they not offer suggestions on improving it?"  Compton walks out, asiding to Jonah "Whatever, man. You wanna drop by? We're at the Holiday fuckin'Inn. Room One Seven Four. Keene," looks over his shoulder "Bring home some tp and a sixer. I'm out."  Jonah listens to Keene's momentary monologue, listening and interested in what the man has to say. He nods. "I understand the concerns of those in your Cabal, Mr. Keene, and agree with those concerns one hundred percent. Hence, I was sent here to fix those exact problems. This is what we are currently attempting to do."  You step back out to the main hall.  ~Fin~
