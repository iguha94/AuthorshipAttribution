         Dark Horizons Waxworks - Main Room(#1957RJ)           This room is not particularly large. Just an entrance room, really. Heavy black curtains hang over the windows in front, shutting out almost all of the ambient light from the world beyond. The room is lit only by real candles and gas lamps. The air carries an old, almost must scent to it, giving you the sense of walking in to a building centuries old, even though it is a relatively new rennovation.          The walls are mostly wood panelled but not in any particular order. Chaos seems to be theme of the decor. The ceilings are high. Ridiculously high seeming, as if they extended far beyond human vision, in to the pitch depths up above. Something may be lurking up there, even now. In several spots there shelves are set in to the wall. Each shelf is empty. The books themselves appear to be sunken in to the walls, giving the room an even odder feel. The floors are completely bare of any sort of coverings. Just finely polished stone. In the center of the main room is a series of ten chairs. The really nice kind, with deep seats and thick velvet cushions. There is a circular table in the middle of them with two books displayed.          Off to the left side is a smallish office. In the back center of the room, you can see a pair of doors, oaken. One door has the face of a smiling demon, a brightly polished brass nameplate under it says Fiction. One door has the face of an angry, almost leering demon, another brightly polished brass nameplate under this one says Fact. There are no visible handles, just a hole in each open mouth with tongues sticking out.                                 +views available                                  Contents: Cornelius Obvious exits: Fiction    Fact    Out    Unfolded and massive and floppy and awkward: Hiro is struggling with a brouchure-map from the Erin's Vale Board of Tourism, engaged in an attempt to fold it back into its original dimensions. He veers through the door - holds it with his shoulder, releases, gives the map a good shake, and begins to re-fold it.  So it's saturday afternoon and you're at the wax museum. Lucky you! When the door opens, the old man who was dozing on one of the large chairs wakes up rather suddenly. Fortunately for him, it looks like someone else is on the case. One of the back doors opens and a small man emerges from it. Dressed in a tuxcedo, he approaches where you stand. In a high, tremory voice, "Welcome to the Dark Horizons Waxworks!" Actually, he yells this. It's very annoying.  Hiro's map flops in half - he seems to have figured it out, now, peering over the edge at the approaching spokesperson. He squints: nudges his glasses up the line of his nose with a thumb, the glossy brouchure crinkling with the gesture. A deep breath, then: "HELLO!" Bellowing, really. His voice is no less irritating when delivered at high volume. "I AM HERE TO SEE WONDERS AND AMAZEMENTS AS PROMISED IN THIS GLOSSY THIRTY SIX BY TWENTY FOUR BROUCHURE."  "Please!" Cornelius yells at the top of his lungs, hurriedly approaching the pair. "Stop yelling!" This is mostly directed at the small man who looks up at Cornelius with beady eyes. "Yes sir." Cornelius rubs his eyes and says, "Fezcy, please go and finish your work." The dwarf bows and then makes his way off. Cornelius turns and offers you a smile. His voice is soft and raspy, like sandpaper on glass. "Sorry sir... he is enthusiastic about his job here and enjoys greeting guests. Welcome indeed."  Cornelius           This is an older man. Slight, sort of frail looking. Top of his head has a sort of dusty look to it. In truth it's just what remains of his white hair clinging to his bald head in light little whisps. Ice blue eyes are behind wire rimmed glasses. Skin is pale white, wrinkled, looks almost like paper. Cheeks are lightly tinted red, just a bit of color there. Nose is hooked, downwards and his lips are thin, set in a line of disapproval.          Slender, scarecrow-like body appears to be loosely clad. The shirt is a plain blue dress shirt with a golden green tie that hangs down in front. The pants are light cotton dress pants, a black color, neatly pressed looking. Shoes are nice but kind of scuffy looking. Carries a cane in his left hand. Ebony with a silver cap in the shape of a smiling woman's head.  Hiro gives Cornelius a look. That's all it is - a look, somehow managing to be completely devoid of specific overtones. The map, now returned to its original dimensions and bearing a picture of the coastline, drops neatly into a labcoat pocket. "Good evening," his tone is a mumble in comparison, gradually ramping up to conversation volume. He offers a hand. "You're the proprietor, right? Heard so much 'n all that."  The old man looks at your hand as though you have offered him a dead rat to eat. Then he extends his hand and shakes yours. His fingers are slender and almost spidery. The skin is paper white and smooth for the most part, with some rough callouses here and there that indicate years of hard work. It also has that dry, wrinkly feeling to it that old people hands have. "Yes. Cornelius Shaboz. A pleasure to have you here sir."  Hiro's hand retreats into his pocket, accompanying its twin. "Hiro." No last name. "Pleased ta pleasedta," he counters, looking away - no eye contact for more than a few seconds at a time. Natural jittery disposition, maybe. Jumpy? Looks back: fixes his attention on icy blues. "Kind of an artist myself, Mister Shaboz. D'you fancy showin me yer work?"  "My work is open for all to see." Cornelius remarks as he walks towards the back of the hall, leading to the spot where the two doors are. "Where would you like to begin?" He asks, those icy blue eyes regarding you. "Fact... or fiction?"  A moment's pause, that faint indecision before the first step falls into place. Then, that kind of forced easygoing stride - rhythm only by contrivance. "Let's go with the imagination side of the show first, huh?" Hiro flashes teeth with the comment.  "Everyone starts with Fiction." Cornelius remarks. Approaching the door, he sticks his hand in the smiling demon's mouth. There is a metallic sound and the mouth suddenly snaps shut with such violence as you might imagine it would sever his hand. But he seems unruffled. A movement and then the door opens. "Step inside Hiro the Artist."  Hiro skirts past Cornelius, his aversion to further contact just barely apparent. You enter the door marke Fiction. Dark Horizons Waxworks - Fiction           Welcome to the hall of Fiction. The hallway is filled with a series of scenic wax sculpture of infamous men, women and monsters from literary history. Each one of these is done up fantasically but with enough of a sense of reality in them to create an air of true menace. This hallway breathes life in to dark figures in fiction, the grand literary tradition of horror, both modern and gothic. Each scene seems to be worse than the last. The gore. The expressions of agony, of torment. It's a difficult thing to look at for long. Unless you like that sort of thing.          This hallway is fairly long, wrapping around to the side, probably heading back the way you came. The floors here are rough, unworked earth it would seem. The ceiling here is extremely high, invisible to the eye. Very dark up above. Occasionally you can hear a menacing sort of scrabbling noise in the rafters. As though something were following you as you move along the displays. From somewhere in the darkness, light fog trickles down. It leaves maybe a foot worth of cover on the ground, hard to penetrate.                                  +views available                                  Obvious exits: Out    "This room holds the nightmarish dreams of humanity. From literature or mythology." Cornelius remarks, closing the door behind himself. "The first is Dr. Franktenstein's monster. A creature that represents, in some ways, a tremendous amount of hubris in man's drive for power."  Quiet pages: Perception + Awareness, diff 5. Hiro rolls perception+awareness (5 dice) at a difficulty of 5:  4 -1- -1- -1-   Achieving -2 successes, resulting in a botch! You paged Quiet with 'Lol.'. Quiet pages: Ahhh... From afar, Quiet thinks... acid trip. You paged Quiet with 'I'm having a flashback. :b'. Quiet pages: Go ahead and make a pose. I'll emit your experience.  Hiro takes a few steps into the room, coming to a gradual stop as he takes in the experience of the chamber. He bobs his head wordlessly in response to Cornelius' words - eyes fixed on the scene depicting Dr. Frankenstein's monster, following the path of patchwork flesh to the girl laying broken in his arms. No commentary is offered - he just takes it in, soaking up the details.  Extending your awareness in this place was most assuredly a critical mistake. You suddenly find yourself overwhelmed by brutal feelings of malevolence. The air seems to shimmer and ripple. You can see tortured souls, their screams filling your ears. Literally hundreds of souls appear to be sealed in to the walls, all of them reaching out for you. Inside the displays you can see little worlds of evil, like a little bundle of hatred, containing entities. Everything seems to warp and run, your skin seems to be almost on fire from the pounding magical and spiritual corruption that fills this place.  Hiro's eyes narrow, slowly - fixed on the broken girl's face. Then: flick to the side, slowly widening. A single step backwards - towards Cornelius, unwittingly. Low-grade vibration running down the spine, showing in the tremor of his hands, now clenched up into balls in his pockets. "I..." Pause. There is something wrong with the kid - he's on drugs, or psychotic, or far too sensitive a soul to be visiting the horror section of a wax museum. "...think I..." Words come out haltingly, the pauses inappropriate, the end of syllables cut off jaggedly. "--gotta be somewhere. You gotta. Excuse me." Shoulders hunch unconsciously, protectively: he turns to face Cornelius slowly, as if forcing himself.  The old man's smile seems disproprotionately large from the rest of his face. The old teeth seem almost jagged in his maw, as if he were eager to devour your soul. "Of course Hiro the Artist." The old fellow reaches out, grasping your arm, as if to steady you. The hand is icy cold and there is an awful breeze that blows through the room. An intensely frigid one. The door is opened. You missed it. Did he open it himself or did it open on its own.  Eyes focus with the intensity that only comes with drugs or psychosis. Hiro seems to be staring -- with a dentist's scrutiny -- at Cornelius' teeth. Then: contact, jerk away, "Not to be impolite or nothin," hissed between his own chompers. Clenched. Get away: he bolts, the reserve of cool run out, run dry. Burnt up. Out the door.  Nothing impedes your departure. You soon find yourself outside of the Waxworks. Indeed, the whole building appears to be composed of those writhing bodies.
