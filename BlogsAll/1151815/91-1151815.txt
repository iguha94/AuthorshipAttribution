         The Brewery - Main Room(#1215RJMs)          A light murmur of voices often can be heard upon entrance to the pub, everything from politics to the sports game shown on the television to the side of the bar. Tables rest in a pattern that would only make sense to a designer cursed with insanity and hatred of servers. There are several tables that line the wall in which the main door rests, but as they come to the door, they arc out onto the main floor and dissolve into a jumble of wooden chairs and formica tabletops. Yet, perhaps to aid those seeking certain tables, each tabletop bears the image of a certain logo for a type of beer. One can see a chubby weasel caught in mid-flight with the words 'Fat Weasel' written underneath beside the more traditional logo of Budweiser. This bit of kitsch is forgone, though, when it comes to the bar itself. The bar is made of solid oak and polished until it holds a warm glow. This glow is constantly sustained by the rag held in the hand of the harried soul tending to the drinks and woes of the patrons of this establishment. The occasional waitress and more intrepid soul can be seen venturing near the strange cauldron forged of shining steel and stranger intent. There is a spigot on the side from which those waitresses who dare its shining bulk draw its blood to serve to those of adventurous bent.         There is a door set in the back wall. A door that bears a white sign which states that none may enter. Still, waitresses and the bartender can be seen making their way to the door and slipping beyond. These journeys into the forbidden are brief, but always do those who return from its hidden wonders bear a broad smile and a pair of mugs filled with liquid gold that go only to patrons who seem to bear friendship and/or kinship to the staff of this establishment.                           >                            Contents: Anastasia Morgan Lily Nathan Obvious exits: Back Room    Out    Morgan is looking at you.  Nathan is looking at you.  In the far corner of the room, Anastasia pulls a book from her satchel out and sets it down. WHen a waiter finally comes by her table, she simply says, "Tea," in a barely-breath of whispery voice. She could well stare holes into the man's back as he departs, waiting to get him away from her.  Pobble saunters into the pub, coat pulled tightly about him to relieve the outside chill. He pauses near the entrance, sidestepping to avoid becomming a barrier to further entrance and slumping just a touch. After stiffling a yawn he begins to pick his way across to the counter.  Lily is looking at you.  Morgan hrrms as Ana enters, watching her settle and brusquely request tea. He then watches the polar bear that is Pobble make his way to the counter, but the scrutiny doesn't last long, strangely enough, but then again, look how ~he~ is dressed! Either a Fair employee or a SCA freak, who knows? He returns his attention to Lily and Nathan. for whom he makes room for upon settling at Lily's table.  Anastasia is looking at you.  "Good, then you haven't yet heard the unflattering ones." Nathan says with a quick grin before moving away from the bar towards the table in which Lily sits. "Thank you, my dear lady. Let me introduce myself. I am Nathan de Laval, and as you said, tailor by trade while finishing my degree at the university." When he reaches her table, he offers his hand to her, glancing towards Morgan as the other takes his seat. For now, the entrance of Anastasia goes unnoticed, as does the strangely dressed Pobble, his attention upon the two before him.   Lily considers Nathan's outstretched hand warily, as if the tailor might be concealing a rabid, starving Doberman up his sleeve, but shakes nonetheless, though her grip lingers in his only so long as the absolute minimums of courtesy demand. Not one for touching, our Lily; she flickers a fainly apologetic smile to him, murmuring, "Lily Black, florist. A pleasure to meet you. Will you join us?" She darts a look at Anastasia, adding a respectful nod, but makes no motion to disturb the other woman; Pobble's coat receives the fleeting hint of a grin.  Pobble settles against the counter, using it to hold up his tired weight as he scratches his chin and waits for service. Coffee is ordered, and a silver nail is rapped against the bartop quietly as he waits. Attention flicks across the room from table to table, searching for the familiar and pausing in places. Such as the dashing rogue, Lily and finally stopping with Anastasia. Beverage arrives, and the blue haired gent begins to spoon in an abundance of sugar.     ---------------------------------[ Glance ]---------------------------------    Pobble..............Tallish, thin guy.

And sighs again. And Ana looks towards the table where the others are, and sighs. And she looks to her hands, and suddenly decides she'd better do something with them. So, she pulls out a chessboard from her satchel and sets it down. Some frat boy a few tables over starts cackling at something on TV, and the sound causes Ana to almost jolt in her seat, and she spills a few of the chess pieces on the ground. Hurriedly, she stoops to get them.  Pobble finishes spooning and stirring in time to observe the peices clattering to the floor. Carefully taking up the mug he makes his way across and sets the coffee down on Anastasia's table before crouching to assist with retrieving a stray bishop from behind the chair opposite the woman. Offering a smile of greeting he deposits the peice on the board and gestures to the chair, "May I?"  "I was going to play chess," answers Ana blandly, her voice a dull and emotionless tone. "But that can wait. Have a seat, if you wish, Doctor. I might have to look at things, though, on the chessboard as we speak, so I hope you do not get upset with me."  Pobble quirks a brow in query but slides down onto a seat, resting elbows on the table and centering his coffee. One settled, he raises the mug to softly blow ripples across the surface of the liquid as he looks across at Anastasia curiously. "I have some news.." he begins.   At your table, Anastasia answers, immediately, and she takes her glasses off, looking at you with those intensely focused grey eyes. "News? Oh yes. I have some news too, but I suspect you may already know it, so I hope you'll forgive just some curious girl for not being so efficient."  At your table, Pobble smirks as he blows the coffee, setting the cup down as he stares back across at you. "Of course, you're just some curious girl." he observes wryly, wiping a trailing drop of brown liquid from the side of the mug before it hits the table. "Did you want to start or should I?"  Lily sits down at table in the corner.  Nathan sits down at table in the corner.  Never let it be said that Nathan isn't a gentleman, even when the lady proves to be so.. shy. For the moment she takes his hand, he bends over it, kissing the air above before letting it go, his smile once more easy upon his lips. "The fair Lily. I have heard a touch about you too, and your way with plants." With the offer of a seat, he looks from her to Morgan, as if to be sure all is ok before accepting with a grateful look. "Thank you both, don't mind that I do." The books gain a look of curiousity as to what the woman might have been studying, yet be it against his ways to ask outright. The mug in his hands gains another sip as he settles into the seat offered.  At your table, Anastasia replies softly, "Well, I could tell you what I learned, or you could tell me what you learned, but I don't want to speak of things here. He's a wizard - he could be listening anywhere, you know... and even I would be hesitant to risk that."  At your table, Pobble nods slowly, finally taking a sip of the steaming brew before he replies. "Indeed anywhere, so how would you get around that?" he asks with a crooked smile, as if having ideas to this end but more interested in entertaining suggestions.  Lily's eyes widen almost comically at Nathan's courtly display, and she rubs the back of her hand in surprise. "I...oh." Ah, yes; how articulate. "Plants, yes." She offers another shy smile, hiding again behind her glass of liqueur. She lowers her voice, then, to converse at the table.  At your table, Anastasia toys with something on her shoulder, nothing there, but maybe is fixing her bra-strap. "What about that office?" she asks, seeming to be hesitant - and though the chess game is not set up, she certainly seems like she's playing it alraedy.  At your table, Pobble's gaze flicks across to the office, and he seems intrigued. "You work here or something?" he asks, looking back to you sidelong. Finger curls through the mug handle, rotating the cup about in place.  At your table, Anastasia looks over there, and suddenly, turns back to you, her eyes narrowing a little. "I meant yours." She's peppering words around, seeing what you'll pick up, and what you won't.  At your table, Pobble shrugs just slightly, response delayed by the consumption of coffee. Keeping it held before his face he regards you over the rim with a half-smile. "That office is no more secure than this place."  Anastasia narrows her eyes at the man across from her, and seems utterly frustrated. WQuickly, and with only the words spoken, "I shall return," she pushes herself away from the table, stands, and turns to stride decidedly across the room to the tall SCA guy.  Pobble seems oblivious to the frustration and settles back, holding mug with both hands in his lap as he watches Anastasia head off to the other table without a word.  Morgan orders honey liquor himself, the only popular brand being Baronjaeger for some odd reason. Bah, American paletes. He looks up as Ana approaches him, nodding to her briefly, taking in her countenance.  Nathan settles, then falls into quiet conversation, the mug lifted to his lips and sipped from at times as he banters back and forth with both Lily and Morgan. The smile never leaves his face, growing at times with amusement.  Anastasia folds her hands before her waist and starts to speak softly to Morgan, looking back over to her table.  Morgan arches a brow, then whispers back to Anastasia.  Anastasia answers to Morgan, flatly, "No. But that is not a thing to worry about. If anyone asks, they can speak to me directly as to my rationale. Thank you, and good day." Just as quickly as she approached, the strange girl turns and starts back towards her table.  Nathan glances up as Anastasia arrives to the table, giving her a respectful nod before she begins to speak so quietly with Morgan. As they talk, he turns back to continue the conversation with Lily.  Morgan arches both brows now and lets them settle, but he's not going to dwell on it. He lets Ana go as she came, returning his attention to his companions.  Pobble watches with the faintest hint of a smile on his lips between sips from his cup. He's half done by the time the woman returns, waiting while he pushes his beverage from side to side idly. As Anastasia reapproaches he raises a questioning eyebrow.  At your table, Anastasia settles down again, and sighs heavily. "I suppose we can do that," answers Ana, who pushes her hair out of her face, and reaches for her satchel. "But would you first be so kind as to help me to carry my things? My shoulders are rounded from all of this walking with these books."  At your table, Pobble drains the last from his cup and nods, "Why of course Miss." he says, pushing back his chair before stopping and tilting his head, "Do what though? You say that as if I made a suggestion?" Phineas comes in to the bar, folding an umbrella up under his arm and adjusting the muffler he has around his topcoat. It is chilly outside, and it threatens rain.  Pobble sits across from Anastasia although he appears to be making ready to stand. An empty coffee mug sits before him and he seems to be too absorbed with his conversing to notice a new arrival.  Morgan sits with Nathan and Lily, drinking and conversing quietly.  At your table, Anastasia pushes a few books to you. There is a notebook, a small organizer, and the strangest of all, a largish old tome, something musty with cracked bindings. To those that are magickally aware, there is something extra about it - it seems imbued with a magick all its own. "Just those, please... I think I can handle the rest."  At your table, Pobble doesn't appear to notice anything untowards about the books and trails a silver tipped fingertip across the strange tome before sweeping up the pile and holding them against his chest with both hands as he stands.  [FAE] Pobble glows briefly as he is enchanted.  Phineas wanders to a small table by himself. After all, you have to get warmed up a bit before you socialize.  Phineas sits down at table by the door.           Eyes, sharp and grey, shaped like rose petals, are piercingly deep, taking in the world around her with cool calculation and profound intelligence, yet bearing a sparks of electricity - quick and vibrant.. This noblewoman fae is an embodiment of mystery, reminiscent of the glow of moonlight through foggy summer nights . A sparkle of diamonds against the midnight, her hair is a glittering deep violet hue, striped wide with shimmering silver streaks. Her hair is an array of tiny, thin braids, most of which are let to fall loose to her shoulders and reaching to mid-back, but with still more twirled up into a topknot and held in place by two onyx chopsticks. A ringed headpiece formed of delicate strands of twining mercurial tendrils rests above her forehead, an irridescent halo for a circlet. The circlet holds a glittering gem that reflects a spectrum of colors, depending on the light, set into a silver filagreed frame and resting just above her brow. This sidhe, like most of her kith, stands tall and proud, at nearly six feet tall but with a frail, limber frame. Her skin is ivory smooth, gentle and white, which stretches over her high cheekbones, broad forehead, and ears which taper out about two inches from the sides of her head into pointed tips. Those grey eyes seem to have stormclouds hidden in their gaze, ever shifting and sparking in their patterns. However, they are partly obscured by a tiny pair of silver-rimmed spectacles, half-moon in shape, perched upon the bridge of her slightly upturned nose. Her lips, soft and pink, seem to have a secretive smile to them, and her gaze seems to usually be partly on that which is at hand, and mostly somewhere else, as if daydreaming.          Her body is dressed simply - well, simply for one of her kith, as it were. Rich silks in purple and silver, softer than the wings of a butterfly, drape over her frame, gathered tightly below her slight breasts with a silver cord,and then allowed to flow down to the ground, concealing her feet. The cuffs of her robe fall just to her wrists in wide bell-like flares, decorated with embroidered roses and vines in silver thread. A silver crescent moon clasp, the traditional symbol of the noble house Eiluned, holds the black cloak that wraps loosely around her in place. The cloak she wears may appear just simply black at first, but at a closer look, you can see the stars glowing against the night-sky silk, sparkling dots that shine luminescently, even in the dark, and in perfect celestial patters, reflecting the map of the heavenly sphere.  >  At your table, Anastasia rises, without a second thought as you take the book, and simply says, "Come. We have things to talk about." Now it's on her terms, though, and she doesn't have to feel so awkward about her mortal body.  Pobble stands with a pile of books held in his arms. One moment he's smiling, the next he looks deeply confused. Glancing around the room with a look of realization that's not far away from 'God, I left the gas on'. Temporarily forgetting where he was heading to he looks across at Anastasia, narrowing his eyes as he tries to say something without taking a breath.  Morgan turns to look again in Ana's direction, nodding at Pobble.  [FAE] Morgan, a blue skinned, horned giant, with a 6+ foot long sword strapped to his back and a mouth full of canine teeth, nods to Pobble.  Lily's gaze lifts from her conversation to study Pobble, and her features still, schooled to impassivity.  [FAE] Lily, skeletal and shadowed, stares at Pobble without expression, offering the barest hint of a nod. Amusement shows in her gaze.  Nathan turns as does his tablemates, golden eyes finding the strangely dressed man standing near Anastasia's table. A quirk of a brow, and then he turns back to his conversation with the fair Ms. Black, laughter given by something said earlier.  Phineas is watching the table where the man is standing up, but Pobble is not object of his attention. Anastasia gets a smug little wave of recognition.  Pobble recovers from his momentary lapse of reason, patting the books in his arms with silver tipped fingers. He sways a little unsteadily, sniffs a few times and shrugs. Pupils that were wide to begin with look about the room intently, as if an earlier ingestion of chemicals had found its mark and he chuckles quietly to himsef, offering a finger waggle to the other table.  Anastasia reaches for her satchel and then, with her free hand, tugs at Pobble's coat. She looks over her shoulder, though, and stops moving for a moment. "Actually... " She starts biting her lip, though, hard, staring toward Phineas, whom she almost immediately spots. She doesn't reply to that wave, but says, "I have a better idea." Wihtout another word, she heads for the door, turning from time to time to look at Pobble, making sure he is coming along.  Anastasia pages: and since you're enchanted, you would know WHY she is reacting like that. Phineas has an air about him that is as chill as a bitter winter wind. Anastasia pages: very uncomfortable.  Pobble turns slowly and plods along after the departing woman, studying her back and clothing intently. Passing Phineas he gives the man a strange look, hugging his books tighter as he hurries on after his companion.  Phineas says, "Be seeing you, Miss Dvornik, on campus. You enjoy the night, eh?" He watches the young lady leave. "I am still waiting."  "Fuck off," states Ana, as blandly as any other word that comes out of her mouth. Her distaste for the man is evident, though, despite her emotionless tone. Now, for those who know Ana - her cursing like that - that's just unheard of. Jaws may now commence dropping.  Anastasia pushes open the door that leads out into the world and steps across the threshold as the door swings quickly shut in their wake.  Anastasia has left.  You push open the door and step out into the world to see...  Suburbs - Oak Parke(#710RJs) -= Gregor and Bard =-          A virtual smorgasbord of shops line the street, everything from the eccentric store that only the most daring of youths dare venture into to the more conservative clothing shop that declares that they have the best deals. One corner of the road has two rival tattoo and piercing shops. Whenever one declares their shop to be the best, the other counters with similar claims. There are photos of their work blown up in display windows, changing from day to day to the joy of window browsers.         The sidewalks are in decent condition; though they do show some of the wear and tear of age. The street itself is in much of the same condition, asphalt showing potholes every so often. The local politicians, of course, have declared that they will have better roadways soon enough available to motorists.   Contents: Anastasia Obvious exits: Dian Cecht DCI  The Brewery TB East on Gregor E  South on Bard S  North on Bard N  Pobble follows, seeming vaguely sympathetic and at the same time enraptured by the current goings on. He asks no questions as he follows after you, but does at times hold the books with one arm and attempt to reach out and touch the cloak..  [FAE] Anastasia's robes sweep at her feet, and she turns to look at you... everything seems like it's going in slow motion, like a really good hallucinogen. "Dr. Steve... I'm sorry... I couldn't stay with that man in there. We need to go someplace safe. I would like to go to the forest, as I have a friend out there who may be able to help."  Pobble's nose wrinkles at this, but he still seems captivated as you turn to look at him. Plastered with a strange lopsided smile he nods to aquiesce, "That sounds reasonable.." he states finally, once he's noticed that he was staring.  [FAE] She pushes some braids out of her face and nods, "Well, I don't know about taking you to my home... the others there might object, as things are very, very tense right now. And I couldn't stay in there... Forest. That is the best option, and I know of places where we will be safe to speak. It isn't far. Just a walk to the south."   Gabbi State Park - Hiking Trails          To the north, the trail grows wider just as the trees grow more and more thin. However, to the south it is a completely different stories. The vegetation grows more and more dense, covering both the ground and the sky, as branches from trees intertwine around the pathways.          People can still often times be seen making their way through the pathways, although not as often as they are up to the north, where the entrance of the state park actually lies. Various small animals become more numerous as well, peeking around the corners of trees, under a bush, or in the branches. If one is particularly lucky, they may even catch sight of a white-tailed deer that moved farther to the north than most of their kind.   Contents: Anastasia Obvious exits: Southwest    North    The woman seems to know her way through the woods, those woods that seem to just tingle with life, and those woods in which the occasional gnome tugs at your pant leg, or pixie tugs at your hair. Ana is very nonchalant about it, brushing them off like little gnats."  And she comes to a stop. "Here. Here will be fine. I apologize... again, I could not let that awful, cold man know my hideouts."  Pobble seems torn between the protrusion of new and fantastical fauna and the woman who leads him through their midst. He comes to a halt nearby and sets himself down on a decaying log. Still gazing he finally says, "What makes him so cold? He was.. disconcerting.." He shivers, pulling his yeti coat tighter about him.  "He does not believe in magick, and is a cold product of this modern world, of soulless and passionless doldrum. He is one who is the antithesis of wonder, he is stark, cold and rationalizes anything he cannot understand away... and for that, he is painful to be around," explains the sidhe, who now spreads her robes to settle on the grass, in a nice little patch. She draws her legs up under her, in a lotus position, and takes a few deep breaths. "This... this is much better."  Pobble looks around pusing his lips, "I am still not so sure." he says distantly, and after setting down the books on the log he retrieves a pad from his pocket and scrawls on it. After a moment of silent scribbling, punctuated by distractedly looking up at you, he nods. "Can never be too certain.." he says, studying the surroundings and pulling a vial from a deep inside pocket. Standing he heads off to a certain point and lets a drop of the clear liquid fall to the ground. Facing you, he heads in a circle, counting steps. While this could be some excuse to get a look from all angles he does seem to have some other plan in mind.  Now, Ana is certainly the curious fae. She watches closely, turning her head and then her body to follow your steps. If she can get away with going for it, she'll try to get a drop of liquid from the ground onto her fingertip, to examine it.  Pobble almost frowns at the trapping of the drop, but replaces it after finishing the circle. He seems to nod at something and deposits a drop on his own fingertip. The vial is sealed back up and replaced and the Doctor lights up a cigarette, closing his eyes as he takes a long slow drag.  Pobble rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:      2 Achieving 2 successes, resulting in a moderate success. Pobble rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:    -1-   Achieving 1 successes, resulting in a marginal success. Pobble rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:  2     Achieving 2 successes, resulting in a moderate success.  Anastasia puts the drop to her nose and smells it, then darts out her tongue to take a tiny taste, then rubs it around in her fingertips, to get a feel for it. She's curious, ya know. Now, she turns again, and watches closely, intently. Little does she know what she just did.  Pobble holds a breath in for quite a while, finally exhaling and opening his eyes in time to see the ingestion of hallucinogenics. He tries his very best to stiffle the emerging grin that fights its way onto his lips. "I guess in a way, that is only fair." he observes.  Anastasia rolls perception+kenning (6 dice) at a difficulty of 6:      5     5 Achieving 4 successes, resulting in an exceptional success!  Of course, it won't hit her for another hour, and since she has never tasted this before, she has no idea what it is. She peers a little, and asks, "What did you just do?" It's not just the liquid. It's the feelings of weirdness she's getting from the air around you.  Pobble settles back on the log, tapping his cigarette and dispersing a small pillar of ash to the night breeze. "Just made sure that it'll take more than casual effort to observe us." He seems to notice that he's still staring, and does try not to, but can't really resist. You don't get to see this every day. At least, not until the hallucinogens kick in. "I made the trees dream that we're not here, and this is what they'll report."  Anastasia's eyes peer oddly at you, and she now seems a bit uneasy. "You ... made the trees dream?" She's not so sure about how well she likes that. The sidhe draws her knees up to her chest and leans forward, eyeing you carefully. She curls her ears outward, and then cranes her head, to look around, to see if anything is different. Just ot be sure, on her part. "Alas," says the fae, "If the trees cannot hear us, then perhaps it will be well to speak. And since I brought you here, I shall share with you what I have first." She draws a breath, and states, "The wizard is close to finishing his murders. Very close. But, while this may seem as good news, it is not. Once he finishes, he will have all he needs for his ritual."  Eri comes into the area from the southwest. Eri has arrived.  Though she tries to keep things understated and quiet, there is no mistaking this woman for anything other than a Sidhe. She stands tall, just a few inches shy of six feet, and manages to make her presence known without saying a word. It's easy to find fairer specimens of her Kith, but that innate quality all of them have still puts her beyond what most mortals can hope to attain. She has an athletic stance and looks to be in good shape. Hanging at her right side is a long, sturdy sword wrapped in a leather strap. The pommel is shaped like a falcon and enameled with the familiar green and gold.  Her hair is a startling color somewhere between bright gold and vivid red. She keeps it swept back into a sleek, heavy braid that ends between her shoulder blades. A few locks hang loosely and sweep her forehead and prominent cheekbones. A very thin, twisted gold circlet graces her brow, melding nicely with the color of her hair. Her eyes are a pale, leafy green flecked with gold and her skin is a darker shade of peach, the mark of someone who spends a lot of time outdoors. She has the typical upswept, angular features and sharply pointed ears of her Kith.  Her voile is all dark woody browns and forest greens. She wears a pair of trousers made from a thick, soft cotton dyed rich, ruddy brown and a plain, long-sleeved tunic in ivory. Over the tunic is a hard leather breastplate, carved with a swirling leafy pattern and fitted to her feminine shape. Pieces of light armor are strapped here and there, used as greaves over her boots, plates over her thighs, and shoulder guards. The armor is dark green and produces a gold sheen when it catches the light. It's hard to tell what it's made of at first glance, an unusual metal perhaps? Closer inspection reveals it to be some sort of chitinous material, like it was scavenged from an oversized insect. Over all is a soft green cloak. Anastasia is seated on the ground, her knees pulled to her chest and speaking softly with Pobble. She just finishes laying a few soft words down, before she goes quiet again, watching him with an introspective thoughtfulness.  Eri is looking at you.  "To summon the Devourer of Souls." Pobble finishes as he exhales with a haze of smoke. "He will need the soul of a magi to finish his work however.." He adds this almost uncomfortably, tapping the side of his cigarette suggesting a mild anxiety. He draws again, long and slow. "I tried looking into the waxworks, but it'll take a little more effort." The Blue Haired Yeti man is sat upon a log, staring at Anastasia quite intently as he speaks, oblivious to any folk along the path.  "Nyarlathotep, as I said to you in the library... why would he do this, though? To what purpose would one bring such darkness into our world?" Pobbly may be oblivious, but Ana sure as hell isn't - in fact, her head almost immediately turns in the direction of the footsteps. She puts a finger to her lips, and says in barely a whisper, "Ssh."  Eri walks back down the trail, her footsteps surprisingly light and causing little in the way of disturbance on the forest floor beneath. As she approaches, she glances up and blinks at the pair not too far off. Pobble is eyed again, and she peers at him for a moment before a quirky smile starts to spread across her face. She doesn't seem to have heard the whole conversation, though, and she clears her throat gently as she draws closer. "Hello," she murmurs, first to Anastasia, then turning her curious smile on the Yeti-man.  Pobble's head snaps around at the sound of another voice and while initially suprised simply at the occurance of an intrusion, sighting the woman his mouth opens just a little wider - smoke drifting out. He seems to be relaxed by something, but he peers across rudely, looking the newcommer up and down. "Eh, hello there." he states finally, letting out a low breath. It all seems to be getting a bit much for him and he places the cigarette between his lips, reaching into a pocket for something or other.  But when Eri approaches, so does Ana rise, and she lifts her dress a little, to dip into a curtsey, and speaks a polite, "My Lady," to Eri. "I hope my presence here with my companion is alright. We needed a place to speak privately, and noplace in town was suitable," she states, her voice soft and thoughtful, but making a point to explain the presence of a stranger so far out.  At Anastasia's style of greeting, Eri's eyes flash open wide in alarm and surprise, apparently not expecting it, and she double-takes at Pobble. Ah, a closer second look explains things. Her shoulders, covered by chitinous armor in her mien, droop in relief and she nods, smiling a little lopsidedly at Anastasia. "I see. Yes, of course," she murmurs, waving her hand. Then, giving a smile to Pobble, she bows her head to him, keeping her gaze fixed on him the entire time. "A pleasure." Straightening up, she says softly, "Well, I don't wish to interrupt your conversation. I should be getting back soon anyway."  It seems that Pobble doesn't really know what's going on. Ladies and curtseys are above him, but at the greeting from Eri he seems to think it fitting to offer some manner of half bow, as much as he's able from his seating poise on the log. "Indeed M'Lady." He sounds almost like Dick Dan Dyke adressing Mary Poppins. He stops rummaging in his pocket, thinking the better of things with new company and just taps his silvered nails together with a strange hard sound in the quiet night air. With nothing else to add right now he just looks between the two Ladies with a wonderous expression, trying to fit this all into some kind of sense.  Anastasia gestures to Pobble with a sweep of her hand. "The dark wizard who we have been hunting, m'lady. This man can help us," she states, directly, her voice bearing a strength and solidness of surety in this fact. She turns to Pobble and says, "Meet the Baroness, Lady Erianthe." Poor Pobble. His brain must be as fried as Ana's will be shortly. Ana swiftly faces the other woman and says, "This is Doctor Steve," and gives Pobble a nod.  "Doctor Steve," Eri echoes as she looks to the blue-haired man in the white coat, her words broken by an unintentional, good natured laugh. Then, more seriously, "Well, I'm glad to know we have more allies..." As her words drift off, she peers at Anastasia, hard, and then smirks faintly. "You've been working with the prodigals on this problem, haven't you? You're part of the group I've been passing notes to." She says this as a statement, not as a question, her tone amused. The wry set to her mouth makes it looks like she thinks she's been had.  A Baroness eh. Steve seems to think he should stand. Everyone else is doing it, so why not? This done, he's still at a loss, the conversation drifting over his head and his expression suggests that on some level he's jumping with a badly constructed net, trying to grab it and bludgeon some meaning from it. He flashes one of his more charming smiles when Eri addresses him, then pulls the last from his cigarette and brings up a foot to stub it on the sole of his boot. Right now, he has nothing to add so he just holds the cigarette butt behind his back with linked hands and stares at the women.  "M'Lady," she replies, her tones even-tempered and thoughtful, "Of course I could not pass up a stroke of good luck that fell in my path; I would hate to offend good Fortuna," and she looks up towards the sky and smiles toward it, giving the goddess a nod. She comes back to the here and now, and then blinks, looking between them suspiciously, her eyeballs ping-pong back and forth, pursing her lips puzzledly.  Eri's mouth still has that wry twist to it as she eyes Anastasia. Looking back to Pobble, she peers a little at him, as though weighing his character. "Well, my lady, you probably know more about this than I do. And what irony, that I get the blame for the waxworks still standing, and not telling your good Baron all I know, when there is one in his house who is far closer to the problem than I." Her eyes twinkle at Ana, then, and she smirks. "No fear. Your secret is safe with me."  She frowns somewhat at all of that, and states directly, earnestly, and with a bit of heaviness in her tone, "M'Lady, there is nothing that you know that the good Baron does not know, and did not know first... save for my association with the good doctor, here. I am looking at the ultimate goal, and politics and personal grudges bedevilled - It is far more important that this wizard be kept from completing his ritual than are our fragile and ephemeral egos." Damn, Ana. Your tone has gone almost completeley to scolding, though it's a general scold on all of the silly fae. "Doctor," she now says, facing the man, "Do you know of the spheres? And of how his victims die?"  Pobble remains in place for a while, but decides to settle back down on the log. He brings his hands around to the front, now free of the filter and probably hoping that no one noticed its discardation. He doesn't seem to bothered by the inspection he's recieving as he shouldn't since he's doing plenty of inspecting himself. Indeed, due to inspecting he doesn't even realize he's been spoken to for a short while. Sound catches up with thinking and he starts, looking to Ana with a sheepish little smile that fades as the meat of the question is realized. "His victims do not die. They are brutalized by the waxworks and then absorbed.. I'm guessing that he uses the statues for storage of their souls. Which is of course, what the whole beef is. Six hundred and sixty six souls." A slow nod follows, all smiles gone far away.  Pobble's remarks don't seem cause a reaction in Eri, other than a mute, grim nod. "Yes, it's what I've been saying to everyone all along. I mentioned this just the other day, Lady Ana," she murmurs. Something in her is dark, disquieted and she grits her teeth, gaze dropping to someplace in the distance.  "Not the statues," corrects Anastasia, "I witnessed firsthand the couple murdered at the park, Doctor, as they died," and then stops herself, "Well, not firsthand, but through my arts, but it really is all the same,' she states. This part, she starts to say faster, her voice getting excited, in quite the same way that Velma from Scooby Doo does when she figures out who the man in the boogyman costume really is. She rushes, quicker and quicker, until she's almost tripping over her words, "The wax figures melted out of the sky above them! They did! Just came out of the sky! And... and they ... they held these small spheres to their victims! Little black marbles, so they seemed! And.. and the souls were just drawn up into those things. The creatures melted back into the sky, and the victims bled to death, just HANGING there... dead... on crosses... oh my god, I can almost see them now..." She squeezes them shut, as if to block the images away, and she shivers.  Pobble peers at Anastasia, perhaps not linking earlier events with current agitation. "Once he has a magi soul to finish the collection, some Very Bad Shit will happen." This is most definately the Trademarked variety of Very Bad Shit. At least he's stopped staring and is now introvertedly considering the situation. "We have a few ideas, but need to investigate the waxworks further. One of my colleagues has been inside the statues.. it ain't so pleasant." Silver nails tap together with a metallic sound. "Supposedly the Devourer of Souls, or Nylarathotep.. will erase all the light of creation." Another slow nod, "Maybe the statue of The Black Pharoah is related to the ritual in some Lovecraftian throwback way."  While that simmering, brooding anger was broiling just under the surface in Eri before, the description of the deaths of those people gets her to stop, softening her anger just a little bit. Her gaze flickers as the details wash over her. Then quietly, she whispers harshly, "No. More. Investigating. This place goes down in the next forty-eight hours. If someone else prefers to do it, I will let them, but I will take a torch to the place myself if I have to. Mr. Shobaz has already taken the liberty of informing me that his ritual is complete. He requires the last piece, and I aim to see to it that he does not have that opportunity."  The younger sidhe draws slowly out of her little scary place, and eyes Pobble, "Yes... so I too, have known one, a fae, too, who has been into the other realms through his keep." Ana starts to bite her lip, then she smiles all too broadly, which is likely not appropriate at all for the heaviness of this conversation. She's still kind of stammery, though. "The pharoah is the obvious answer, is it not? And being that he seems to me to be one completely pretentious asshole, he'd likely use it, too. Fucking spook." Her voice getting faster, more uneven in its speaking, halting occasionally, as Ana peers up towards the trees for the words, "I told the Baron that.. They are not ready to act, though. They do not believe the threat is that close. Fools."  "I think.." says Pobble slowly, pulling from his pocket another cigarette. This one however is crooked and wrapped in blue paper. "That burning down the house will do no good at this stage. He's not stupid enough to leave his work in such a visible place..Maybe." He falters, looking across at Ana and a peice falling into place. He smiles lopsidedly despite the seriousness of the situation, looking sheepish as he sparks up his bluestick. There is a pungent aroma as he continues, "I don't think it'd be that easy. He'll be no pushover." Words are spoken distractedly as he studies Anastasia. "I have a.." Again he pauses, looking almost shy for the briefest moment, "Friend who was studying his craft there.. Maybe she'd have an idea of the rest of his place. After all, it could be that his ritual is there, but also somewhere else. Or maybe no place at all."  "Put that away," Eri says flatly, deadpan to Pobble, pretending not to look directly at the blunt, but straight ahead. "And he's working on some sort of... thing... under tarps in the lobby of his museum. And I've heard mention of objects that are tied into this, but I haven't found out any more than that about them. I'll find the contact there." Any more she's going to say is cut off by Anastasia's strange behavior. "Are you okay?"  Anastasia has suddenly become quiet interested in her cloak. She holds it in her hands, and is running her fingers along the stars, poking at them, and saying softly, "Rigil. Siruis. Betelgeuse..." Her other hand is rubbing the fabric in slow circles, seeming to just delight in the touch. She looks up slowly, and her heavy eyes with the quite large pupils stare blankly for a moment, and then she closes them, nodding towards Pobble, "You are most correct, there, too. I say, for starters, we create as much havoc around the museum as possible. Police. Fire department. Water mains breaking. An elephant loose from the zoo and shifted through the spacetime contiuum to that exact, /PRECISE!/ point, right above an unsuspecting tourist, on whom it will fart, and terrify to a near comatose stupor. And then... THEN, my friends," she sweeps, riding on some sudden inspiration, "Then, we go after the statue, his balls, and the whole Sha-boz!" She's practically whooping. Damn, she does love it when she gets a good idea. She bobs her head at Eri, "Oh yes. I'm doing /great/."  Pobble looks sidelong at Eri as he pulls on his blue stick. It seems to be needed, hands were on the verge of shaking. Still, some people don't like it. Those same people walk around in insect armour in the woods. It's all reasonable, right? He stubs the thing for now, carefully and sets it down besides him, looking disgruntled. The mood doesn't last as he's taking up in the amusement of Anastasia's rant. "Eh, yes. There are plenty of options." he agrees, "Whatever is done, will be difficult. I have no idea what he's capable of, but would guess at it being 'A Lot'.  Eri catches the look from Pobble and fixes her attention on him. Her mood is already dark regarding other things, so that gets unintentionally shifted to him for the moment. "As far as my job in the forest goes, I'm still a cop. If someone walks by, they're going to see a Park Ranger standing here doing nothing while people break laws around me. Just don't do it where I can see, okay? And don't burn the place down either." She says the last not as though she'd believe he'd do that, just sort of darkly humorous. Looking back to the raving Anastasia, she peers at her, hard, then pulls back. "I think I'm going to go have a chat with a certain someone about other business. Would you care to be there, or would you like to come along?"  Anastasia gasps out, and her eyes widen and she freezes in panic. "Oh... ohmigod, no... no, please no, M'lady, good Lady, good Baroness, please don't get me in trouble with the Baron for telling you these things..." SHe looks completely terrified at the thought, and hurriedly, she grabs Pobble's arm and yanks on it. "Do something. /Please!/" As if anyone with any rational sense in their heads would know that htere is little that Pobble could reasonably do.  All that Pobble can say is, "You're a cop?" incredulously while looking at Eri. "I guess Park Rangers really get some whacky gear in case of emergency.." After a whistle, he peers back at Anastasia and pats her hand supportively. The fact that he's clueless isn't lost on him. Still, he puts on a better smile and beams it at Eri. "What she said? Please?" he asks, feeling somehow honour bound to try and do something or other.  Eri frowns at Anastasia, half in confusion, half still upset about other things. "I've been betrayed by your Baron, Lady Ana. Completely and utterly. I intended to remedy this situation. If you like, I'll tell him I forced the information out of you. Let him take his anger out on me for that." To Pobble, she says tiredly, her voice low, "Look harder at me."  Nothing in particular stands out about this woman. She could be considered either completely ordinary or somewhat pretty, according to one's tastes. Her skin is peach-hued and freckled, a feature highlighted by constant exposure to the sun. She doesn't seem to find a need for makeup, but she looks decent enough without it. A crease or two on the outside corners of her eyes marks her as being a bit beyond her mid-twenties, possibly in her early thirties. She has hazel eyes and mousy brown hair. The hair is kept back in a braid that ends between the shoulderblades. She has prominent, upswept cheekbones and a slightly pointed chin, giving her an angular look.  Her height is more impressive than her looks. She stands just a few inches short of six feet, emphasizing her lean shape. Though light, she has an athletic stance and very little bodyfat. Her arms and legs are well-toned and look as though they are used to being put to work. Her nails are kept clean, clipped short, and unpolished.  Right now, she's dressed in the uniform of a Washington State Parks Ranger; a khaki button-down shirt tucked into olive green denim jeans. Over the shirt is an olive green quilted jacket, good for keeping the rain off, with a brass nameplate over the left breast pocket and official-looking patches on each shoulder. Her only adornment is a thin gold chain that hangs inside her shirt, held down by a hidden weight. The jeans are held up by a wide black leather belt that also holds a utility knife, several other small black leather cases, and a walkie-talkie. On her feet is a pair of old black hiking boots.  'Ohs' silently after staring his hardest at Eri. This does seem to take a bit of getting used to. He alternatives between glancing and staring for a few moments, enamoured by the novelty of double vision.  Don't back someone like Ana into a corner, not with a head that's a little twisted right now. She shakes her head tightly, and now says once again, clasping her hands hard to the point that her knuckles turn white. "Baroness. No. Please... think of the priorities... we have two days..." Her descent begins. "Please no. Any way you got this knowledge, you did not get it from me! You... you..." And further she descends, from fear to paranoia - the metaphorical fur starting to raise. She flings her hands at her sides, and now The Rage (tm) is starting to well up, though it's got a wyld chaotic fling about it, like a live wire dancing on wet pavement. "I give you truth and you stab me in the back! And they call Eiluneds treacherous!" Suddenly, she looks at her hands she just flung and becomes /intensely/ interested in them, The Rage (tm) subsiding almost as quickly as it came. She drops her jaw a little and waves her hand in front of her face, then two and fro in front of her eyes. This most delighted little smile comes over her lips.   Eri looks between Pobble and Anastasia, her expression worried now. "Um, Doctor, would you mind very much if I took the young lady home now? She looks like she needs to rest. And I hope next time we meet under better circumstances..." she sighs. Her hand reaches for Anastasia's upper arm, but gently.  Pobble moves to stand, looking uncomfortable and surreptitously slips something from a pocket into Anastasia's hand. He gives her a 'shh' look after glancing at Eri and straightens out his coat. "Well, eh.. It was fabulous meeting you both. Again but different." He stands sheepish, clapping his gloved hands together and smiling like the boy who's been caught doing something terribly bad but is unashamed. He nods to Eri's request. "I think that may be wise.."  Anastasia points to Pobble, "But what about him, wandering around, enchanted like that...?" She looks to Eri, a little hopefully. "Pobble, come find me again. I'll be right here." She taps the ground with her foot, and nods to Eri. "Don't get me in trouble... or I'll be very upset." There's a dark tone just beneath the surface on those last two words.
