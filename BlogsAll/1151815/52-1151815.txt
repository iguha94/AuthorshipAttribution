         Downtown - Spadina and Wellesley W(#269RJ)       The student ghetto dominates this entire area of town. Dilapidated condos and apartment complexes stretch up into the sky. Laundry can be seen hanging off balconies; the paint jobs here are faded and stained with acid rain marks, and the buildings themselves look as if they were built in the 70's. Scattered small commercial shops provide for the residents of this area, who are mainly students attending University of Toronto to the south. A steady stream of student traffic marches by here at all times. In the mornings and afternoons they head out to attend classes, while in the evenings they go out to hit the bars and enjoy the Toronto night life.  l wig  A ten foot wrought iron gate, with ornamental spikes formed on the tip of each pole. It is part of a fence line that surrounds the entire Firehouse Complex, keeping the world out with its stoic gaze.       The outer courtyard of this once noble building, is covered completely with cracked and worn pavement. It surrounds the entire building, which is then surrounded by the imposing ten-foot high wrought iron fence. Each pole is tipped with a fire-hardened spike that gleams gently in the halogen lights that shine brightly from the corners of the flat roof. The building itself was built in the late eighteen hundreds, and if you look closely the cornerstone has a bronze plaque reading eighteen ninety-two that is covered with dirt and forgotten grime. A squat two-story building, built of stone and mortar it has stood at this corner over a hundred years but has not withstood the ravages of time. Much of the once grandiose facade has begun to fall away, revealing in many places the actual stonework that supports the weight of the building. A huge rolling garage door, probably newer then the structure itself since its made of interlocking pieces of iron sits centered into the front wall, with a small human sized door built into it so it need not be opened and closed every time someone wants in or out. There are a series of windows around the building, two on each side on the second floor, while the first floor has one on each side excepting the front in which the large garage door is situated. All of the windows are dark, revealing not an ounce of light from within, possibly dark curtains, or maybe just painted black to keep unwelcome eyes out. Also they are all covered with thick security bars, screwed into the stones with heavy but well rusted bolts. Overall the building gives most viewers a sense of sadness and lost, for what was once a symbol of hope and protection, is now crumbling like so many other grand landmarks.  This Building is a Nightzone   James steps through the Wrought Iron Gate and out into the street. James has arrived.  A bum stands outside one of the student buildings, holding a battered coffee mug shaking it and shivering from the cold in a grungy poncho and toque.  James comes out of the Wrought Iron Gate. It slides closed behind him. He looks around, smiling to himself as he spots Compton. Checking his pockets he begins moving towards the older man.  The drifters bloodshot eyes wake up a little as he spots a perspective mark heading  his way, "S-spare c-c-change m-mister?" the big guy stammers. He twitches oddly, his eye lazy and wandering. Perhaps signs of Parkinson’s?  l James         A young gentleman who appears to be in his mid twenties. He stands a few inches over five feet tall. His long, straight silky hair is a blond so pale as to be almost white. It falls to the middle of his back, and is tied up with a dark green ribbon. His long narrow face and hands, denote a fine bone structure, although his nose is a little on the small side. By far and away his most striking feature is his vibrant emerald green eyes.         He wears a loose fitting green t-shirt, and a relatively new pair of stonewashed levi's. On his feet are a pair of well worn blue Nike's, and from time to time you can catch a glimpse of his socks, which are a dark green. On his right hand ring finger is a silver ring, engraved in a celtic knot pattern, and around his neck is a braided silver chain that disappears in to the collar of his shirt.  James grins at Compton, pulling his hand out of a pocket. Dropping about two dollars wotrth of loose change in to the cup. He speaks up after loosing the change, 'Ofcourse I've got spare change. How's tricks?"  The townie looks perplexed, "Y-you kn-kn-know me mister?" and glances in the cup and gives a half smile. The other side of his mouth seems to be numb, slack.  James nods, "We've met a couple of times before. You probably don't remember me. It's been over a month since the last time I believe.". He looks Compton over, "You probably aught to get something warm to drink. And I've got places to go. Take care of yourself." Woth that he looks around to see if he can spot a Taxi.  "W-wh-what's yer name b-buddy?" the old hobo stutters.  James replie, "James Anderson.", just before hailing a taxi.  Compton half grins again, waving a mitten’d hand in the air at Mr. Andersen as he leaves, "T-thanks..."  James replies, "Any time.", then steps in to the cab that has pulled up, closing the door behind him. James has left.  Compton straightens himself out, and quits with the fake twitching. A wicked grin creeps up his face and he dumps the change from the mug in to a Zip Lock he’s pulled from his pants, “Gotcha motherfucker.” He says savagely to no one, well, maybe the derelict passed out in the stairwell behind him. He now pulls off the poncho and toque, depositing these on top of the sleeping bum with his tin cup, and recollecting his parka and bundling back up. “Thanks bud.” he says to the wastrel before moving on.  ~FIN~
