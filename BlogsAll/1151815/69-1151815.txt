         You walk north along Parliament to Wellesley. Downtown - Parliament and Wellesley E(#179RJ)       Sitting on the edge of Cabbagetown, the homes here are nearly as old as those just south of here. However, the residents themselves are a little poorer. The old townhouses crunch together along the street, their dark-brown paint jobs chipping away to reveal the weakening wooden panels beneath. One-way streets become the norm here as well, creating no end of traffic problems. Residents park on the roadside since the homes here rarely have driveways. Small variety stores, grocery stores, hair-care salons and restaurants are all common here, all within easy walking distance of the residents of this area. With clean sidewalks, freshly paved roads and the newly added plants to create a comfortable air.  Contents: Clairance Obvious exits: Corso's Books   The Dubliner Pub  //.etro: It is 03:37 am, the dead of night, on Saturday the 18. day of April, 2009.  Clairance is making his routine rounds along the street. The townhouses here need little police attention, of course, but the officer is eager to spot any trouble that may revolve in or around the local pub. Clairance walks with his hands clasped behind his back, his green eyes constantly surveying and scanning the area as he walks. His pace is ginger and not filled with haste, although it could not well be described as 'leisurely' either -- an average pace.  Clairance read your description.  And so little in the way of pedestrian traffic that Penny is as evident, and just about as useless, as tits on a bull in a china shop. She's loud and .. well just loud. Singing at the top of her lungs, her head enlarged by mammoth headphones, the cord dangling and looping from neck to knee. Crossing the street she narrowly avoids getting hit by a crawling cab just outside the Dubliner. The cabbie doesn't get out to check on her - just picks up his fare and moves out, business as usual. Her singing gets a little lower around a smaller crowd of university drunks, mouth moving most likely out of sync with the track. She hun-huns a few words and bursts out again somewhere around the chorus.  The officer of the law, Clairance, doesn't seem amused in the least by this. Checking the time on his watch, he then takes a healthy stride over to where the girl -- not far from his age, anyway -- is walking. Making note of the various University students in the area, he takes the moment to gently tap the girl on the shoulder and motion above his own head for her to remove the headphones. Clearing his throat, he waits for the other to comply. "Ahem." The rookie cop seems a bit nervous as his eyes glance here and there, but this should be something he can handle easily.  There is a rustle, and the sound of footsteps as Micah steps out from the shadows... Micah has arrived.  Micah steps out from a little gaggle of folks hanging out infront of the Dubliner, he pats one of them on the shoulder and says "Thanks man..." before walking down the street, smiling.  Those other kids clear the area; cops at this hour are all business. Business they don't need, want and fear writing home about. Those kids couldn't make bail if they sold themselves. Penny, however. Let's call her reckless. Drunk and disorderly. Blissfully unaware or maybe she's just numb. Whatever the reason, she doesn't feel Clairance's cattle-prodding finger, goes on bobbing her head, starting intently at the traffic light or cross signals.  Unseen beyond the Shroud by the majority of Quick, Flay stalks along behind Penny. Looking bemused by her antics and sucking the blissful vibes trailing behind her. His face darkens and his lips curl in to a sneer as the Officer approaches.  The police officer taps Penny on the shoulder once more, a bit of a frown forming over his features. He may go as far as to grip her upon the shoulder, but not quite yet -- unless she doesn't respond, of course.  Micah strolls across the street, jaywalking. He dances through the traffic rather gracefully, comming on over to observe the Constable and the Citizin interacting. Micah is a devout Libertarian, and he would hate to see any abuses of power.  Penny jumps and whips her body around, right forearm first. They teach this sort of thing at civic centers. Put out a good strong elbow/arm and it's possible you won't get mugged. Maybe she's that side of drunk, which is why she misses and looks surprised, caught in a stumble. Turning head then shoulders and pivoting fully, Penny's other hand wrenches the headphones off her ears. With eyes half-closed she bellows "HEY why don't you watchwhoyou'rebumpin inna! Goddamn don't be all touchin'an" It's possible to sense the eye's focus through the conduit of the voice as she slows. Slower. Staring at Clairance, she mouths 'oh shit' and backs away a few steps. Lucky for her there's no oncoming traffic.  The police officer offers a bit of a smile, nodding his head at the obviously preoccupied and perhaps otherwise... engaged... woman. "Ahem. Ma'am, I think there's a slight problem here... you see, the hour is rather unfashionable for the loud noise you were creating. So, I'll have to ask you to not be quite so loud in this area... and, are you alright? If you need to get home safely... perhaps due to partying a bit much... we can arrange that for you. Don't want to see anyone getting hurt.." He clears his throat, stepping out of the way of traffic and speaking to the lady in a polite tone.  OOC> Micah says "crap i gotta go...sorry..." Micah escapes OOC.  Wide-eyed, Penny blusters "It's perfectly appropriate! I'm GOING to a FUNERAL" red in the cheek, red in the eye - it's probably true. Granted being drunk and singing dirges isn't the most obvious way of representing - generally and traditionally it's all black clothes, black armbands, black limos and a cachet of flowers to rival any wedding.  Penny has none of these things. She has a discman, maybe an open container and a head full of steam "I'm Fine, I'm just going" a scowl creeping past her lips and into the curve of her shoulders "going to a funeral okay so just go shove a bum offa bench o ..er..or something.."  The dead have very few liberties, and thus few libritarians. Flay has a chip on his corpus when it comes to people in uniforms, 'The Man' so to speak. Seeing the growing confrontation starting to form between this nights entertainment and the bastion of the status quo he moves between them. Of cource being incoporeal and trapped beyond a veil of disbelife it would not seem to do anyone any good.  "Oh." The officer takes a step back, nodding his head at that for a moment. "I see. Well, do you need a ride or perhaps an escort? And could I still ask you to keep the noise down, mm? I am sorry for your loss, but we still have our laws I am afraid..." He nods his head at that, confident in his approach.  Penny looks up and down the block. There. There's the cruiser. Spotting it's location, Penny makes sure her destination is in the opposite direction. This? is obvious. She was walking right for it about a minute ago while she was busy singing and waking up the neighborhood. Still she carries on at an indecent decible, possibly on her way to eleven "Oh yeah, right! We chat," elongating vowels and biting off the ends of phrase "you put your arm around me, then ease out your cuffs, shove me in the backseat and I WIND UP IN PRISON and MISS the FUNERAL. Yeah right you're sorry, you're sorry.. yeah you're sorry.." hiccupping in the middle, grief interrupted "you're sooo sorry baby.." She covers her mouth and turns, leans on the nearest thing; the hood of an old plymouth and casually vomits into the space between its tires and the curb.  "I don't have any desire to arrest you, honestly. I'm about your age, and I understand how these sorts of things happen... now, where is the funeral? I'd be happy to take you there. Unfortunately, you're not really in a state to go there yourself... you could hurt yourself, or somebody else." He says with an authoritative nod, clasping his hands behind his back and offering a weak smile.  Flay reaches forward and waves a gloved hand over Clairances eyes... all unseen by the living officer and his perspective chargee.  //.etro: Flay rolls "charisma+pandemonium" at diff 7          For a total of 3 success(es) including 2 ten(s). OOC> Clairance says "Eep. What happens?" OOC> Flay says "Lemme explain." OOC> Flay says "You're experiancing a momentary hallucination. Will only last a second, but will seem real. I'll @pemit the exact results." OOC> Clairance nogs.  Penny retches, dry heaves and shrugs off Clairance's hand. She flinches, presses herself forward to the car and twists away. "Told you to lemme'lone man," spittle dropping off her chin in a long spidery vein. "JESus mary and joseph," stubbing her toe on a garbage can, she doesn't seem to notice "you can't go where I'm goin'and anyway you got no" her tone of voice angrier, swallowing whole truckloads of bile (both real and imagined) "BUSiness at a FUNEral for a body you never met so just fuck.off.and.die."  "Oh, shit!" The rookie cop is immediately on his radio and running in the direction of the shots, quick to pull his own weapon and begin an impromptu investigation.  Watching the pig in uniform scurry off in pursuit of the wyld with a smug grin, Flay wispers across the Shroud to Penny, "Better get going chick, he won't be gone long." and turns and slinks off into the night having taken his fill.
