         [ed Note: Penny sucks at magic, blames God-in-Pobble's-head]  You step into the bar. Overdrives Alley - Main Bar(#6632RlJM)       This is the large, open main room of a rowdy biker bar. Near the entrance  is a single bouncer who casually looks everyone over as they enter. On the far  side of the room is a long, wooden bar with old, leather-covered bar stools in  front of it. Behind the bar is a long mural of a naked woman, sprawled out on  her side. The liquor selection here is fairly limited, but there's a wide  selection of beers to choose from.      Around the room are wooden tables of varying sizes, surrounded by wooden  bar chairs. Along the wall across from the bar are a few booths. In one  corner, next to the bar, is a door marked 'Staff Only'. Opposite it, on the  other side of the room, is a staircase leading up to a more private room.  There are two old, battered pool tables to the right of the front door. They  charge a loonie per play and have a limited selection of pool cues, none of  which are in good condition. A juke-box sits next to a small dance floor that  is rarely ever used for dancing.

His attention is focused on a journal which he scribbles in..  Seth is seated with Antigone as they talk quietly and relax. Antigone has a beer infront of her and Seth has a glass of Tequilla and a bottle of it infront of him. Antigone read your description.  Antigone settles back a bit from Seth, shrugging her shoulders. "Left her, then left me - go figah," she murmurs, perhaps a bit louder than she intended too. Her eyes shift to tak in the new arrival of Penny, eyes narrowing slightly at the signs of abuse on the other woman.  Someone was holding the door open letting in the frozen north winds. Not many people are walking in with it. There IS Penny, though ignoring the bouncer and the comments, shaking snow from the mantle of her jacket and dusting off the brim of her cap. She flashes open a wallet for him; probably picture id of some kind and moves further into the bar, a stiff-legged trek toward the back.  Seth shakes his head and sips his drink. He seems slightly amused at something. He turns and watches Penny walk in and head past them.  Penny moves away from the door, and Pobble glances up towards it. The lines of vision and motion fail to cross in the brief second that the man leaves his writing and he looks back down and continues the scrawl. A hand reaches absently towards the beer. As he grasps it, he lets go and twists his book about, writing something quickly across the top line. A small red stain is left on the cool condensing caraffe.  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" privately to Pobble at diff 6.          For a total of 0 success(es). Antigone arches a brow at Seth, leaning slightly back in her chair as the pair contiunes to speak. She gestures absently toward him with her empty beer, and then looks about for the bartender.  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" privately to Pobble at diff 6.          For a total of 0 success(es).  Penny changes direction suddenly, this not being such a crowded place, for the jukebox next to the dancefloor. One hand in her backpocket, one to lean on into the machine. Its lights make her a glow of red, a wash of yellow then green. She presses the button to make the options change, keeps pressing the button. After the third time she finds something appealing, the green glow glinting off her white teeth - her smile displayed just to the selections there. She pulls coins from her pocket, punches in numbers and turns away. Her song comes out of the machine, Lou Reed doing his thing while she stands there looking pointedly at the booths. "I'm waiting for my man, twenty-six dollars  in my hand" he sings and the band plays behind him "Up to Lexington, 125 feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive.. I'm waiting for my man."  No no no. Thick lines criss cross the last section of work, and intersecting lines and words are hastily resurrected around it. The new sounds cause the man to again glance towards the door, but it doesn't last. While writing feverishly, he maintains that eerie calmness and again reaches for his beer. A line is drawn, Pobble looks satisfied at something. He takes a moment to sip the swill and survey the surroundings, searching surreptitiously for a smoke.  Antigone begins to laugh at something Seth said - a full bellied, full throated, all amused type of laugh. The laugh causes her emerald eyes to dance with green falmes, and her dimples flash in the light - even if briefly.  "Here he comes, he's all dressed in black .. beat up shoes and a big straw hat."  Penny could be singing along, her mouth moves but nothing audible comes and she does this thing with her hand when Pobble looks up; she's in his sites now - thumb and pinky fingers splayed then she swipes two fingers across her chest. Probably that guy at the bar got a little sloppy with his drink.   "He's never early, he's always late - first thing you learn is you always gotta wait. I'm waiting for my man."  At first, Pobble doesn't recognize the girl staring back at him from the bar and his gaze moves onwards, but then he backtracks. He offers a smile as he finds the cigarette, holding it up before him and flipping it about in his fingers. It comes to a stop pointed at the beer opposite him. Popping the cigarette into his mouth, Pobble shrugs. His now free hand makes a vague motion of hanging loose before he flicks a V finger formation at the girl and takes up his pen. The writing continues.  Antigone shakes her head a bit, a waitress dropping off a beer for the woman. She takes a long pull, then settles back more fimrly in her chair.  A whole verse has come and gone by the time Penny makes her way over to Pobble's booth. The Velvet Underground's churning now, burning out the speakers with "Everybody's pinned you, but nobody cares. He's got the works, gives you the sweet taste.." Music spurs her on and with her other hand she interrupts the flow, drops something in his book. She takes the cigarette from his mouth, fingers close around the filter and drags. "Ah then you gotta split because you got no time to waste. I'm waiting for my man." She also takes the pen from his hand, turns the book to face her and writes something down. Making long, deliberate eye-contact with him while the song winds down, Penny turns the book around and walks out with this cigarette.  Pobble pages: Looks like complex chemical formulae and notes written into shapes of crucifixes and steepled churches.  She wrote: God's fucking with the frequency, Kenneth. Also, come home. We're packing.  Unpreturbed by the apparent violation of his workings Pobble stands, gathers his belongings and leaves. The two practically untouched beers remain on the table as the fellow heads out into the freezing cold.
