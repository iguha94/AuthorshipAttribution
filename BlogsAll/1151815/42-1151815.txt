         //.etro: It is 8:05 pm, late evening, on Thursday the 01. day of January, 2009. . Downtown - Yonge and St. Clair(#113RJ)       This intersection is covered with streetcar tracks, running west and south. Nearby is Rosedale, one of the nicest residential neighbourhoods in central Toronto. There are two movie theatres within the same block, the Hollywood, and the Hyland. The Royal Bank takes up one corner, and on the other side of St. Clair is a popular little McDonalds that is connected to the subway station. Just north of St. Clair is a commercial development housing Bruno's Fine Foods and several small restaurants including Bregman's, a great breakfast place. The rest of the area is mostly made up of office buildings and various stores. Like most of Yonge's intersections, this one is usually busy with traffic and pedestrians.  Contents: Griswold Penny  Griswold arrives from the south. Griswold has arrived. Griswold step up from the south, a slight smile on his face as he walks north.  Curbed with the rest of yesterday's celebrations, Penny stands shivering. With a coat slung over her arm, she tries to light the end of a cigarette with a cheap plastic lighter to no avail. From the continued repetition, it sounds like the flints long gone.           An extremely handsome European man stands before you, at about 6' 11" and with nearly 330lbs of muscle. Naturally straight blonde hair flows down his head like a waterfall, parted at the side by pointed, almost elf-like ears. This man's deep sky-blue eyes look out at you from a slightly narrow face with strong bones. Some people, gazing upon this proud, dignified man might feel an inexplicable sense of unease creep over them.           His brown leather trench coat spreads evenly over his broad shoulders and muscle-bound back and flows down past his knees, nearly hiding simple faded-brown pants, a bright new arctic blue polo shirt and faded black combat boots. This ensemble comes together to show a life of living it rough.               Griswold read your description. There are no +view's in your current location. +Viewable items on Griswold:  EERIE  Griswold sufferes from the flaw Eerie Presence.  Griswold's eyes are pretty much trained on the north, and there is a bounce in his step. As he nears you the sound of the cigarette lighter becomes apparent and he looks to you. After a moment he picks up that you are shivering as asks, "Are you ok?" As his large frame would suggest, his voice has a low pitch.  Penny looks up, a faint crease where a smile would be on anyone else. "Need a light," the stick bouncing around her words. But because she's cold-thus-perceptive she takes it out of her mouth, the better to vocalise. Two fingers form a v around it and she gestures a circle with it at you "got one?"  Griswold shakes his head. "Nah, sorry. I don't." he says, before looking around. "It's a little cold out, are you off to somewhere?"  "Waiting for some-" it takes her a minute but once it settles in, once she gets a good look at you, Penny begins to take a step in the opposite direction. Her fingers curl around the cigarette, folded and probably bent into the palm of her hand "-one. Uh.." her coat begins to unfold with less grace in gravity than most things and she makes those little required adjustments to keep it off the ground.  Griswold seems oblivious to your reaction, and nods as he looks around. "Hope they come soon, and get you inside. You look cold." he says innocently, looking back to you and smiling warmly in return to your forced smile.  One step. Then another until there's a better distance. The traffic of other groups of people seem to be unconciously giving wide berth to this immediate square of pavement. Wind blew the trash just then or the light changed and those people have opted for the other way afterall - and on occassion one or two still pitched onward look back over their shoulders. They look at Penny because she dropped a pile of tobacco on the ground and hasn't moved, they look because she can't stop staring at you, they look because she hasn't covered up as they have to shield herself from the weather and her nose is running and her eyemakeup is smeared.  Griswold tilts his head to the side and looks genuinely concerned. "What's wrong?" he asks in a worried tone, stepping forward a little. The empty circle that the pedestrians unconciously leave around the large man follows him, he does not seem to notice this among other things.  She looks down the street again, briefly. It could be interpretted as a flinch; it is not a genuine gesture. The metal and glass tied in her hair make a faint clinking like china touching crystal; gradual clatter.  Dusting the mess of brown flakes off her hand, Penny protests "I'm /fine/. What's your problem? I just wanted a light." Pinched nerve in her voice.  Griswold recoils a step at this change of tone, his eyes widen and he automatically holds up his large hand with palms facing you. "Sorry, you just looked cold..." he says, looking over you once more.  Fierce for a moment, matching the timbre of the traffic sounds; loud horns streaming by. The noise and attitude pass almost at once and Penny lifts her shoulder, turns her head to the side cutting off direct eye-contact; a gesture that removes her profile. Provides wind-block so she can work on the lighter again and a cigarette pulled from the depths of a hidden pocket.  Griswold waits for a moment more, just standing and looking at Penny with wide eyes. After a moment he tentively says, "Ok, well. Have a good night." He begins to walk towards the north. "And get inside, before you freeze."  Penny can not run away, not in those heels but she has this innate sense; knows when an opportunity to take off has come along. Time has passed - this mystery person hasn't shown, if there was infact anyone at all. She does not hail a cab, preoccupied with the cigarette, the lighter, managing the coat.  Penny can not run away but you get the feeling she would if she could.  Griswold shakes his head softly and walkes off to the north, he can be seen head and shoulders above most of the pedestrians.  Relief comes in Mustang form with a raspy engine and a paint job that's seen better days. The worn car rounds the corner a few digits over the speed limit. It's tinted windows conceal the driver, but it appears picking up Penny's on the agenda. It's rumbles to a halt a few feet away from her, in double parked mode. The passenger's side door is punched open, and weed smoke rolls out from it's innards like Redman were at the wheel. A voice from inside, "Oi."  This is the thing about walking in heels most people don't understand; the reason women cross one foot in front of the other is that the angle of descent keeps them from toppling over. It isn't because the jaunt puts a particular accent on the hip, it isn't even necessarily appealing, this walk of Penny's, this is about functioning in near-immobile conditions.  And once given pause, the body tips toward the car. She steps off the sidewalk, off the curb keeping her balance with a light touch on the no-parking 6pm-7am sign toward the Mustang. Bending from the waist, she squints into the haze. "Oi," and gestures hang-loose with her hand, two fingers with the cigarette pointing left.  Griswold walks north to Eglinton. Griswold has left.  "Inski." Chase looks back to the road, hands at 10 and 3 o'clock like a good driving student. The engine revs, the man's expectant. Eyes to the rear-view. Always checking his back. "Less go fer a ride, eh?" Always checking his back. So much so, he hasn't had time to spot Penny's new duds. Until.   " Shite chica, whatchoo... Makin' a few extra bucks on the side?"  Ducking into the car things hitch; her skirt, her breath, her heel in the grate. All of these things quickened in the confines of the leather-trim and tinted glass.  "Yes."  Her fingers press gently into the seam between seatbelt buckle and gearshift; a stitch in her side, sinking lower into the bucket, legs taking up a mile beneath the dash. It's the heels. Still looking dead ahead, she offers nothing more but asks "Light?" untucking the cigarette from behind that ear.  But Chase is still drinking it in. His eyes say stuff, but he just turns back to the task at hand. Driving and lighting. A zippo sits kingly above a pile of ashes in the ashtray, his car lighter being occupied by a wide band-width police scanner. It's pointed to as the car pulls out into the scant traffic.   "'M not even gonna ask."  Penny exhales, sighs really, like this is work or this isn't fun or there's something Chase is missing. Fingernails tip into the ashes and just the smooth click and sudden butane-smell seem to take the edges off her. Soft crackle at the far end, she keeps the lighter open and ducks it somewhere down and to the left.  "It's not like that," an explanation without saying too much "it's a thing I do," emphasis on 'thing' as she drags "just for the new year. Jesse can explain it better than I can" and exhales through her nose.  "Ah." It's like Chase stops her from continuing, even though her explanation is final. Into the flow they pull, the Mustang takes no quarter amongst it's peers. A right turn here, a left turn there, and straight as piss for a mile or to as some vintage Velvet Underground starts playing. The stuff before that dumb German chic jumped aboard.   "You niggers ain't set up yet, eh? 'S what Jesse said..."  True, you don't need to hear it whatever it is. Another time. "God's got a say about that this month. s'all involved on account'a Pobble's meddlin'an' his fingers in all o" she cuts herself off, realizing with intermitent clarity that she does sound like a crazy person. The business of closing her eyes seems an easier thing, so Penny slumps over to the right putting her forehead to the cold glass of the window.   "Make any resolutions?" voiced with a kind of disinterested twinge; it's the most mundane thing she can think of to say, the most normal because normal is what's necessary for long drives out into nowhere. Then when its quiet, quiet in the relative sense; when there aren't sirens chasing down some other fool, aren't parties being passed by, aren't flashing neon adverts - when it's dark she sings along "Like a bird, you know she would fly, what can you do" can carry a tune but it's creepy "you see her walkin' on down the street" half mumbling into the elbow repropped on "look at all your friends that she's gonna meet.. you better hit her.."  "Eh..." It's not a yes or no, Chase makes a left. The whole first part, about god and Pobble, that get's a look. But it's fleeting. Fucker knows better than to ask by now. "I suppose. Well, mebbe. Mebbe I'll try and get laid this year. 'Aven't done that in a while. Mighta forgot how ta do it, though." The idea builds, Chase is giving in to it. The stubble on his chin makes some noise as it's scratched in nervous energy. Some nods, perhaps he just made that one on the spot. "Yeah, ta get laid. That's it." A moment's pause and he spots the girl riding shotgun. "Looks like that was yers to, eh?" A grin back to Penny, hooker heels and all.  Tranced out in between lyrics she says something that sounds like "to be loved" or "to be most beloved" mumbling about the season, the aeon, the darkness and desire passing. Like a scratched cd jumps around in the track, the groove of conversation is lost. A jumble of mixed up words and thoughts, burning down the cigarette is the only aide - each drag breaking up what she says so that each phrase makes sense. "He said there's no such thing as sin," repositioning herself to see and speak to you, uncoiled, the stutter of metal and glass when she turns her head "that's it's all apostelic, mysogynist bullshit." As she leans, there's a sound, like sticky tape pulling apart from the skin.  Eyes that were expecting a quip or joke in return, wait like a stood up prom date. Chase just watches her for a few silent beats after she speaks, turning back to the street without the prize of a proper reply.   "Yeah." The void is filling with some prompting conversational hooks whilst stopped at a red light. "Weed's in the glove, chica. Blow's under the seat, 'n I gotta few whip-its left from my New Year's blowout."  Penny is innocent, blameless. "Pull over, hey? M'gonna.." she half-tilts her head meaning she's gonna one or the other or something else entirely. "Where we goin'anyway?"  And it strikes you just then that she is void of that particular pique you're feeling... in a lights-are-on but no-one's-home kind of way. It starts to make twisted sense as she digs around in the folds of the coat and pulls out a small leather case - same case you saw her with last week. "Fix with me?" Unbuttoning, you can see it holds just the right things, just the right size - spoon, needle, the smell of antiseptic assaults and tucked into the other side are things both wet and dry.  A moment's consideration. "Why the fuck not." Sure, twist his arm why doncha. And so Chase pulls over, and they fix, and the rest is a narcotic blur.
