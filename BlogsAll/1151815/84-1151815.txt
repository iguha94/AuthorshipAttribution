         Old GE Plant - The Invisible Loft       Skylights[1] flank a high, peaked roof, mirrored surfaces reflecting washes of neon and blacklight in mingling pools across the ground below. No natural light reaches this place - it exists independent of the cycles and systems of the world outside, time distorted to the infinite now of a dexedrine binge.      The area is dominated by a circle of seven high-backed chairs[2], surrounding a low coffee table[3]. Twin televisions hang from the roof by heavy iron chains - tilted at an angle to bathe each half of the ring in the warm glow of artificial reality.      Curling womblike around the periphary, the majority of the floor has been sealed off behind an amorphous plastic shell: bulbous and twisted as if exposed to immense heat, with a hue varying from embryotic pinkish-red to mouldy green. Veins of fiber optic cable run through the shell, a circulatory system in pulsating blue and purple. Piles of bedding[4] cling to the walls at irregular intervals. A solitary airlock[5] is the only access to the laboratory without.      Beyond the curving walls, the magic happens. Machinery once found on the factory floor has been reconstructed in bizarre mechanical simulacra[6]. Cabinets and work surfaces bear the dull oxidized finish of refurnished metal - a slick, glossy sheen drawing uncomfortable aesthetic parallels to an animal's organs. Plastic, metal, and glass tubing snake through the whole: an interconnecting network linking the machines.                  [Footnoted +views set.]  Contents:  Obvious exits: Library    Closet    Exit    Keene is sitting in his given chair around the coffee table, tapping intently at a PDA. A cigarette idles between his lips as he sets up his schedule for the next several days, taking note of several key lunch meetings.         "I need to find a good dry cleaners," he mumbles to himself, tapping at the sketch area and circling that part of his schedule.  There is a strange little high pitch singing noise in the air before a small, bright purple imp appears near where Keene is sitting. Of course. Messenger imp. Flashy.          The Hermetic pauses in his PDA-tapping when he hears the familiar singing noise. Being trained around Bonsagius magi makes one accustomed to old-fashioned ways of communication. Saving his progress and turning off the PDA, Keene leans forward when he sees the imp.         "Hello," he directs to it, putting the device back within his coat. "how may I help you today?"  "Greetings to you Keene, from Master Bartius of Seattle." The imp bows low to Keene. "Master Bartius sends me to express concerns that he has. An apprentice member of his Chantry came to Erin's Vale to visit family. And she has disappeared here. The good Master suspects that she may be dead for he can not reach her. Could you do Master Bartius a favor, see if you can locate the apprentice?" The imp inquires of Keene          "Of course," says Keene, automatically straightening up when he hears the word `Master' in Bartius' title. "I'll need her file, of course, but I can set to work on finding her right away afterward."  "Very well! She was here for the holiday. There is not too much you should need from us. But here is her file... with picture." The purple imp says, producing a file from thin air, offering it to Keene. "Any help you can provide will be appreciated. You will hold the Master in your dept." The imp bows again and vanishes. A faintly bad smell remains. Stupid imp jokes.
