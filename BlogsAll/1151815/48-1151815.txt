         [Ed. Note: Cheerios, cocaine and lsd: The Breakfast of Champions]  Derlict House - Kitchen    Beneath two stories, lies a basement with all the common amenities. However, it's been converted into a semi living space.   In one corner, a boiler and heater stand, though only function down here. The fuse box is also configured to power the subterranean portion of this structure. A washer drier are next, and a small makeshift sink. All four walls have been padded with heavy insulating material and wires run down from key holes in the ceiling. A few bundle are strapped together, feeding into a video network system. Four screens sit at a small square table, flashing camera feeds from strategic points outside and inside the house above. A reclining chair, made of brown leather, encircled with ashes and empty beer bottles on the hard cement floor. A TV sits atop another broken TV, it's wires arranged to split off the block's main cable system.    To the far wall, a long table has been set up, stacked with a variety of chemical compounds and mixing material. Everything from begin base liquids, to corrosive acids stored in chem-hazard tanks. A myriad mix of beakers, vials, and test-tubes line the shelves above. Gloves, goggles, tongs, all things a junior mad scientist would need to conquer the world. Some larger steel drums of chemicals are stored under the table, and some electronic chem-analysis equipment blinks an occasional red flash.   And finally, set along the length of the large basement, seems to be a make-shift firing range. Shell casings litter the floor at one end, opposite from a large reinforced steel door dimpled with a thousand bullet dents. The remains of a tattered paper target hang on the door. Over it, a picture of Ronald McDonald.    Contents: Chase Obvious exits: Reinforced Door    Stairs Up       Chase is totally eating Cheerios right now.  She comes down the stairs slower than the last time, does a kind of slide-cling thing along the wall. Sounds different; canvas on painted foundation. Looks different, too, in her bright red trenchcoat. Penny half-jumps the last few steps.  "YO."  The response is muffled by breakfast goodness, just the way to start a morning. "'O." A single circle of cereal falls from Chase's thin lips, taking a few drops of whole milk with it. Hunched forward in his leather chair, the TV's talkin' about Bill Cosby's latest illegitimate son. A backhand wipes some mess from Chase's square chin, he's still wearing last night's outfit.   "Sup neegro?"  Chase read your description.  "Fliponnatoons, hey" coming up behind the leather chair, crunching on something she's got in her pockets "or like Jerry, the snooze rots your brain y'know." She says this with some authority, plopping indian-style next to the chair, eyes fixed on the screen.  Cereal crunching, Chase turns back to the screen and raises the remote.   He hopes that by 'Jerry', she meant 'Springer'. Because at any given moment, in any given country, Jerry Springer is on some fucking channel. Today, on a very special Springer, 'I hate my wife's purse'.   Chase looks back to Penny, speaking with a mouthful. "Wha' 'ou thin' 'bout that chi' 'epsy, eh?"  Of course she did. The audience is up, chanting for The Man Himself. Chairs are almost on the rise - check out the redneck in the green silk shirt.  Zoned out way before she got here, Penny tips her head to the side studying the screen. Strangely inebriated, cornflakes litter the floor where she misses her mouth mumbling something significant about the creator and the creation. this is apparently all she has to offer on the topic, jumping directly to "Have you seen Pobble? God's concerned." The trench pools off her shoulders, sits on her waist and legs, trapping her arms. She doesn't seem to notice, goes on "We can feel him, like magnetic north. We just don't know where he is."  "Sup with that god shit, anyways?" Chase takes a tactical pause and reaches inside his coat to pull out a snuff vial. Filled to the brim with powder. Some up his left nostril, and a healthy dose spread upon his Cheerios. A few sniffles follows, he makes circular motions in the milk with his spoon. Before she can answer, he goes on. "No. Last I saw 'm he was runnin' outta here trippin' balls. He always like that?"  "I thought maybe Mexico but then he said 'Don't be trite'" mimicking someone or other following her own thread, continuing in that same booming voice "'we can not tolerate that level of filth' so then I thought maybe Rio and he didn't have anything to say about that," evening out to her indoor voice. Forgetting any impulse to chew or even bother with food, Penny picks up a magazine and holds it up infront of her face during a commercial. "God is one of us." A pause.  "Or both of them. And we can not be together but we can also never be apart." Another pause.  "It's very complicated."  A spoon full of cocaine and Cheerios hovers near Chase's lips. Red eyes look down to his seated guest. "Wha... No." He shakes his head and eats.   *Crunch* "'N Rio's dirtier than Mexico could ever be. They fuckin' sell 12 year old boys in shanty villages, 'n the whole place smells like spoiled coconut oil and dirty thongs." *Crunch* "This is one yer messed up cabal thingies, right? Wait, forget it. I don' wanna know." He points with his spoon, "Pass me that beer."  You say, "The trouble is the reception. Messages stop coming in clear," she sighs, slouching toward the longneck nearest her until she realizes there's the coat. The stupid coat enforcing consequential restriction of movement. "and he thinks he can take it back but it has to /want/" to punctuate, to underline that she tears her left arm out of the sleeve, "to leave. And it doesn't."  Rocking forward, she reaches for the beer and lands back with a wince.  "Plus it likes this batch. Amped the frequency."  Penny does juggle the magazine and bottle inbetween fingers pretty well at first but there's a dangerous second where she might drop one or both. However she made the grab, it's clear either her hands aren't big enough to manage or that signal-block she was talking about stems her motor functions as well.  Muffled noises come from Chase's full mouth and he shakes a spoon. He wants no explanation. Just to hear it, might infect him with some of her craziness. But the beer's accepted, yes. That, he wants. And promptly washes down some narcotic cereal. Holding the beer and bowl, his gums go numb and he makes funny smacking sounds.   "Fuckin' 'ell... froze my damn teeth." A few clack against his stained choppers with his spoon just to test up. "Fuck." There's a few twitching motions. "Fuck. So ya didn't answer my question. Whadja think bout that Hepsy girl? Least she didn't scream when that talking monkey came at 'r, eh."  She sits there watching the program change from Jerry to Judge Joe Brown with seamless continuity, blinking. "It's hard to communicate," digging around in one of the pockets, she pulls out a small stack of business cards and lays them out before her making a tarot cross "because at times there's an intense euphoria, the drug in the blood and in the skin" still trying to explain things, Penny turns card after card over. They all say the same thing: RYAN REEVES - REPORTER in a stocky block print. "so 'I' can only observe."  She sits up a little, peering at the cards "She seemed nice. Willing to believe is key."  A tick build in one of his eyes, Chase sets the mostly empty bowl down on the table behind him and has more warm beer. "She was runnin' with another crew, vaguely connected to my peeps. Buncha bubblegum hold up kids though. Need ta get a few calluses on 'r hands." Yes, there's the whole deck, eh. RYAN REEVES taunts Chase from the floor, prompting him to turn his head minutely. "What's that about?" He still got the spoon, it makes a great pointer.  Penny repeats "Bubble gum," losing her focus. Her eyes roll to whites for about half a second then "That was strange," and leaves it at that.  Milk from the pointer/spoon drips across the floor and rolls back under the chair in twin fingers. A badly laid foundation is no surprise in this part of town. Penny slips her other arm out of the coat and starts turning the cards so they all face the same direction. "After I saw you in the gardens I ran into him."  Slowly she pieces the night together, phrases fractured around this obsessive/compulsive act of card-turning "I was a little fucked up. And still bleeding. And he wanted to give me a ride."  "And then he gave me his coat."  "Suits ya, I suppose." Again testing his gums. Numb. "Fuck." Chase leans back into a position more conducive to relaxing.   "That monkey tripped me out. How the shit you deal with that all day? I lose my shit I think."  "I'm here, aren't I?" turn-swish of the card on the floor, collecting powder and dust of every kind underneath. "He used to be cool. Then he like.. grew up. I dunno .. do familiar's even HAVE hormones?  "Dunno. Think he's the first i've met that wasn't trapped in a grid-splice on some partible Mac. 'S way better than any A.I. shite. Fucker even smokes." Chase, still feeling his frontward gums.  "Needs a leash," said with none of Penny's usual venom and bile where the monkey's concerned; she's pretty fucking calm right about now. "..s'much of a genius Steve is, he hasn't been able to make one what that monkey can't get out of. Lost him once in Bel Air... that was a fucking trip.." trip.. hahaha, Penny's laughter mostly swallowed.  Laughter's contagious, but her's only inspires a chuckle. And even that is marred by Chase's fingers between his lips and gums. "Like the old dude to, he was money with the heat. Any of you fuckers got skills with bitches? I mean -skills- ya know. Be happy ta pass on the S.E.A.L. training. Handy shite, it is."   //.etro: Penny rolls "6" privately to Penny at diff 6.          For a total of 5 success(es).  [Ed Note: The last few poses of this scene have been edited out to protect the innocently retarded individuals writing the scene. They were tired, they were cranky and mostly they were illiterate. It went something like: Penny displays gun-fu, Chase goes okay, fine. Be that way. Penny leaves, Chase takes a piss. The End.]
