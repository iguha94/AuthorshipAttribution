         Crazy Eight's - The Stoop(#6864RXnJ)       The stoop is a glass-fronted atrium with a wide view of the street and  sidewalk outside. There is a cigarette machine, a working pay phone and a  couple metal racks that hold the local free periodicals. They are the rags or  sheets that one can while away the time without the added cost of purchasing a  newspaper. White and black tile covers the floor in Roman meander line. Set  within the center of this design is an eight ball.                                --> NIGHTZONE   Contents: Alexander Obvious exits: Pool Hall [PH]  Front Door [O]  One look at the dark-haired, dark-eyed man, he can be as young as twenty, or  as old as thirty, one look and his seriousness becomes obvious. He has one of  those ageless faces that makes his age so hard to determine with just a look.  Most of the hair is shaved from his head, leaving only a couple of weeks  growth. He could be of Southern European birth, the tone of his skin being  slightly darker then that of most born Canadians. When he moves, it is with a  subtle feminine grace.  Today he is wearing loose-fitting black pants with a plain black, leather tie  belt with a silver buckle around his waist. A beige long sleeved jersey looks  both comfortable and warm. A lightweigh, size bigger traditional, leather  jacket is worn ontop of it.  A chunky watch is carried around his left wrist. The only jewelry visible are  a pair of small silver rings decorating his left ear and right eyebrow. The  top most part of a black tattoo is visible just above his color. The rest of  the pattern vanishes hidden under his collar.  People, persons. Not many, just a few and none of them particularly pleasant.  There's a guy over there shooting glances at Penny, grumbling to his friends.  Something about money. And Penny? She's just hangin'out, havin'a beer.  Alexander let's his gaze sweep past you. Only to return to you along with the  other guy's attention. Lowering the pool cue, he rubs it against the back of  your head. "For luck." he explains, blinking at you. "Going inside, doll?"  //.etro: Penny rolls "6" at diff 7          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Alexander walks in off the street. Alexander has arrived. Alexander wraps the plastic off of a cigarette package with one hand as he makes his way into the area. His other hand is busy, shouldering a pool cue as if it was a rifle. Stopping just short of the door leading into the bar, he turns his head to look around the people present. Alexander read your description.  Penny looks sideways at you, ducking fast out of the cue's way so that it lands somewhere between her neck and shoulder. "Don't," twirling the bottleneck, she inclines her head forward "ever," sliding her free hand down the cue "do that again" and pushes it back toward your chest with just enough force. Just enough to underline the insult to her person.  The guys grumbling in the corner have quieted a little and one coughs nervously under his breath. "Man, leave the lady alone."  Alexander swirs the cue and places its end against the floor, leaning just slightly against it, "I can't promise that. I'll make it up to you with a beer though. If you let me." A glance is shot the guys in the corner, and he smiles, "It seems chivalry isn't dead. Just hiding in a dirty bar."  You say, "No I don't think so" emphasis on the don't. Penny wobbles her beer at you, see? it's still mostly full, and steps back toward her perch between cigarette machine and public phone. Reaching into her pocket for a loose cig, she tucks it behind her ear for later "I'm sure you and your little stick can keep eachother company."  Alexander remains leaning against it for a moment, then straightens up and proceeds with walking with you, "Actually, it belongs to the bar. I borrowed it yesterday, and came to return it." He lays his arm over the phone, the one of the two machines most likely to be used less, facing you, "I'm Alec."  "And I'm not interested." Looking around for help from those guys isn't an option, so she smiles flat and tight, brows raised to further her point. Adjusting the grip on her beer bottle, Penny's fist a white-knuckled range around the brown glass.  //.etro: Penny rolls "willpower" privately to Penny at diff 7.          For a total of 1 success(es).  Alexander glances at your hand, nodding at it, "Come on, you don't need to do that. I'm too much of a coward to fight a girl anyway." He picks the reciever of the phone up and brings it to his ear, "Police, help. I'm being picked on by this white chick. Send backup." Smiling slightly, he puts the phone back in place, "I'm Alec.", lifting his brows as he tries again.  Penny stonewalls with a big pull on her beer. Shifting back on a rickety barstool for an absent bouncer, Penny sits unimpressed. Must get this alot. Posture changing second to second, it's obvious she carries no such prejudice. She nods back to the phone "Pick it up, dial 0. Then tell my boyfriend you're Alec."  Alexander shakes his head slowly, "I didn't ask to sleep with you, doll. Just to buy you a beer. And, possibly get your name. People come to bars to meet people, not to be left alone. Unless they want to be percieved as loners. Or enjoy torturing themselves. I've tasted the liqour here." He smiles at you, and wanders past you, "Okay. Can't blaim a guy for trying." The cue lowers once his back is turnt to you, and he is about to pat your behind with it once, "Enjoy your evening now."  ..except for the simple fact that Penny's sitting on a stool. There will be no ass-patting. She drinks. That's all she does. No farewell last-jab or anything as childish. It's not that kind of bar and it's definitely not that kind of night.  +recc for Alexander sent.  Alexander returns after about a minute from inside the pool hall. This time without the cue. Lifting his chin, he grins at you, "Take care, doll." Pulling the hood of his jacket up, he narrows his eyes slightly as he looks up at the street lights. And then he is gone, wandering up the sidewalk.  Alexander walks into the streets. Alexander has left.  You have just received a +recc from Alexander.
