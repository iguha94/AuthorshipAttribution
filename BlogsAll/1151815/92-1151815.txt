         A note is left in the loft, it's scrawled in a spidery hand recognizable as Pobble's.    Today I met with some strange people and noticed the existance of a before unnoticed duality. Some bizarre creatures that call themselves Fae and seem to be normal but then unexpectedly are other people while still being themselves. I am unsure what to make of it, but they seem to exist in some manner of feudal society.  Anyhow. While their leader, the Baron seems unwilling to act, certain of their apparent nobility are keen to put an end to Cornelius's plans. Supposedly they have been informed that his ritual to summon Nylarathotep (The Devourer of Souls) is complete but for the taking of the last Awakened soul. Once this is done, the demon shall rise from the deep umbra and consume all light in creation. Supposedly. They plan to do some ass kicking and put an end to this. Some of them seem kitted out with all manner of strangeness, like swords and shit. I don't know. If shit goes down, maybe we should support them? One is called Anastasia. She's a violin teacher. They all hang out at the Brewery. Look them up.  Me, I need to go back to London for a little while. My grandma died.  Love an kisses.  Pobso.   [OOC: My parents are comming to stay for a week or so and will be living in the computer room hence I won't be around much. Email me if you need anything.]
