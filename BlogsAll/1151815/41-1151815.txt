         Metro.  Middle of the night.  Somewhere on Mars.  Rolling Fields          It's a gorgeous sight, even in the dark of night, the brilliant yellows and greens of tall grasses waving in the chill wind, rolling hills stretching off as far as the eye can see. Pure, white stars shine in the breaks of the thick, dark cloud cover above, bringing a mild, yet still chilled, warmth to the vast expanse of land.         As you reach the peak of one of the highest hills, you are able to survey the land as the scent of life washes over you. Almost ninety degrees from the hill with the huge, gaping hole, and far off into the distance there is a massive forest, several deer darting into the trees as you spot it, as if sensing your discerning eye. Immediately opposite it is a large body of water, from which the cave stream flows. Ninety degrees from it, directly opposite the cavern entrance, there rests Novus Valnastium, a large stone complex resting atop another hill, one lone tower stretching into the sky above.         A little off to the northeast (assuming Novus is north), a small, metallic-bowl structure sits. Long tethers sometimes stretch into the sky from beyond it, connecting to a marvelous airship docked above the bowl. The slender curves and high-tech metals used on the small building are a stark contrast to the ruins just fifty yards away, and it easily gives away who is responsible for such a building.                                  >                                  Contents: Standingwater Obvious exits: Novus Valnastium    The Living Forest    Clear Lake    Hole in the Hill    High-Tech Workshop      Standingwater is seated before a fire at the usual gathering spot. He looks... irritated. Nothing new about that.  Keene takes his time moving out of the tunnel, muttering to himself about `a decent set of stairs, you fucking savages'. He has managed to avoid getting his shoes wet, though. Gradually, he makes his way down to said spot, standing for a few seconds in silence before speaking. "Hello."  Standingwater loses some of his irritabilty as he looks up from poking at the fire with a stick. Fuckin' savage. "Ah. Mr. Keene. Good to see you. Pull up a rock. Get comfortable. There is a job that needs doing, and the Invisible College seem to be the ones to do it."  Alex wanders out of Novus Valnastium in the distance, slowly closing ground until he has arrived in the heart of the fields. Alex has arrived. Alex steps out of the keep and head in the direction of the cavern.  Keene, invited for once, moves over and finds a relatively flat rock to sit on, easing onto it carefully. It's disingenuous to see a man in a suit and Standingwater sitting near each other around a campfire, but so is most of the Realm. "Alright," he says.  Standingwater tosses a bit more wood onto the fire. "We've had our differences over methods. But one thing I do like about you guys is your willingness to actually get out and do something. I'm a bit of an activist myself. My early years were spent in ecoterrosim before the Verbena came calling."  Keene slides a cigarette out of his breast pocket, waves it in the fire for a second, then brings it back and takes a mild puff. He listens.  'Ecoterrorism' catches Alex's ear as he nears the campfire. His head turns a little in the direction of the two men, probably a side ways glance in their direction from behind the shades.  Standingwater pulls his hat down over his eyes as he speaks. "We have a problem. Unfortuantly, working within the system isn't working. We need something radical. Is there something you guys can do to make the Hyperion site unsuitable for building? Say, a huge sinkhole? Generally unstable ground? Perhaps a radon problem."  Alex perks an eyebrow at Standingwater's request. "That sounds like acts of terrorism," he comments, not really seeming to personally find any problem with it,"People jumped all over me whenever I talked about doing such thing...."  Keene sits silently, having no immediate reaction to Standingwater's proposal. He puffs on his cigarette, gaze tracking to Alex for a few seconds before looking back to the native. "Let's assume for a moment," says Keene, "that such a thing was even feasible in this heavily urbanized area. What purpose would it serve?"  Standingwater shrugs. "It does sound like terrorism, yes. I'm only opposed to reckless terrorism. Materials and equipment should be the primary target. Attempt to minimize harm to bystanders. Sometimes lumberjacks get hurt when they cut into a spiked tree." His attention is drawn back to Keene. "At the very least, it would delay construction long enough for the legal process to go through. We must thwart the Ironteeth in their attempts to build a new base of operations. "  "I have already start working on getting a cease and desist order to stop construction until the issues that have been raised can be resolved,"Alex comments.  Cally has connected.  Keene smokes for a while after that, thinking in a meditative silence. He ashes his cigarette before speaking again. "This is a futile endeavor. Let me explain my reasoning." He gestures with his cigarette. "Alright, let's say some damage is caused to the site. If you make the ground collapse, you're probably going to hit a snarl of utilities and wreck at least a few city blocks. The city fixes it at great expense, and Hyperion probably gets another tax deduction out of it. If you go the more man-made route -- monkey-wrenching subtle or not -- you give Hyperion the sympathy of the people and destroy the credibility of protesters." He puffs on his cigarette. "The legal battle is a noble attempt, but in the end Hyperion will win. They have the upper hand on every front that matters in this fight. Simply put, an office building that will bring commerce to the area is more valuable to the city than a playground, which in itself has been shown to be ridiculous in the media. The Node is as good as theirs, and has been for some time. Throwing more time and energy after this fight is only going to consume resources that could be used elsewhere."  Cally comes out with the blueprints, and scraps of the Daedalus.. spare parts.. and an urn.. she walks to the area where the grass is glow in the dark blue.. and kneels.. as she begins to bundle the blueprints and scraps together...  Standingwater pulls an pipe out of his pack. And what a pipe it is. An eagle carved into the end holds up the bowl with its wings. "Okay. So we don't stop construction. Can we, perhaps, sabotage the node? Make it useless to them?"  "I don't know," says Keene. "Prime is not an area I know very much about. The Magister would probably know."  "So, is it your opinion that we should just sit on our asses while the Ironteeth build their Construct a block away from the portal to this Realm?..." Alex asks tilting his head slightly.  Cally stuffs the scraps in the urn.. and kneels.. "to the Daedalus.. For a short brief time you were my Valiant steed. A moment and we soared like eagles. We were invincible. Yet with my hope, I feel you died a noble death, and I swear to you, It shall not be in vain. your protegee will of course be strong and be built from the lessons you taught me.. " with that she begins to light the blueprints and scraps.. acrid smoke, some of it black begins to filter out.. and crackle..  Standingwater squints up at Alex, "El Queso Grande is working on moving the portal to a more secure location."  Alex smirks glancing over to Standingwater. "Yeah... He has been working on that for months now,"he comments with a slight shake of his head,"I wonder what will happen first... The Construct is completed or the Portal gets moved."  Keene puffs on his cigarette. "Please," he says, looking to Alex, "throw your head underneath the wheels of the machine. Don't let /me/ stop you. If you want to keep burning up your trump cards and psychic energy in an unwinnable scenerio, go right ahead. Personally, I only get into fights where there's a shot at coming out on top." `El Questo Grande' merits Keene's attention for a second, but he represses any reaction that may have come about. "I imagine moving the portal can be done in an evening."  Cally bows her head as the smoke flows.. "ashes to ashes.. chemical reaction to chemical reaction.. Particle quantums to particle quantums.. I now release the spirit, the soul of Daedalus to be reformed on the winds of Ether." she watches as the remaining items are consumed to ash..  "So, what do you think is a winnable battle?" Alex asks,"...Sabotaging traffic lights to cause traffic jams?..."  Standingwater tosses more wood on the fire. "Then how about a fight you can win? Mecca Pharmecuticals. I understand it's been around for a while, and word has it it's a Nephandic base. It should would suck for them if the ground opened up and swallowed the place or something."  Keene smiles thinly, and seems about to fire off a riposte' when Standingwater distracts him. "Mecca Pharmecuticals? How much is known about the place?"  the black smoke finally dissipates as the personal ceremony ends . Cally looks up.. "I told you.. Create an endangered animal, release and imprint it to the building location of Hyperion.. the Red tape of trying to move said animal will give us months to move the Node."  Standingwater facepalms. "An endangered animal suddenly appears in the middle of a city?"  Keene says nothing, looking briefly to Cally, then back to Standingwater. "I've never even heard of this Mecca place before just now. Has someone been keeping a file?"  "Thomas did,"Alex comments as he takes a seat on the ground.  Cally looks to Standingwater.,., "It happens quite often actually.. in the United states..  Keene moves his attention to Cally for a moment. "What my colleagues here are trying to say, I think, is that the sudden appearance of an endangered species in an area which has not ever been known to have such would appear disingenuous. All that would occur would be the transport of the animal to a more suitable habitat."  Standingwater takes out a small leather pouch and loads his pipe with the contents. "I couldn't shit an endangered species anyway. Well, maybe an endangered plant or a rare insect. Nothing anybody is going to care about."  Cally says, "the animal would be moved.. yes.. but after the Environmental groups fought for the creature to remain there.. would Hyperion suspect we are behind it? Maybe. In any case, there would be a lawsuit, Hyperion would have to go to court before they could remove the animal . And as such Publicity for them would be turned.. It is subtle, and it will give us time to move this node.. Why are you even against it? And if they do move the animal, it will be to a refuge where it's addition would help restock the species."  "I would still be interested in what would be a worthwhile battle,"Alex comments as he leans back on his elbows.  Keene waits for Cally to finish, includes an adequate pause, then speaks again. "No. This gambit would fail. This is my reasoning." He puffs on his cigarette, giving a `one moment' look to Alex. "It would become clear by a cursory examination of the past data that the endangered species would not belong there. First, there is the matter of it being in the center of a massive metropolitan area that has been throughly sanitized of most wildlife. Further, the area would not be suitable to support most living things considering its surroundings. Any environmental group that discovered an endangered species of any kind in that area would probably encourage moving it rather than allowing it to be exposed to the negative environment of the city."  "There was a rare and endangered frog found in the urban waste land that was turned into the Sydney Olympic site,"Alex comments idly,"Tied up construction of the Olympic village for months...."  Cally says, "fine.. whatever.. you boys continue to nay say.. I had my discussion of it.. you guys figure out how to do it , but as for me, I'll back out of this endeavor. If you ever decide to come up with a unified plan I'll frankly be shocked.. you boys asked for suggestions, I gave one, and rather then consider the possibility, you have condemned it in less then a minute. fine. Do what you want.. I now wash my hands of it.. Besides, I've more important things to worry about."  Keene finishes his cigarette. "It will fail. Feel free to try it, of course. I have outlined my issues with the idea in a civil and professional manner." He looks back up to Cally. "Have a nice day."  Cally looks to Alex and gives a small smile.. At least one person has considered her suggestion.. But for the others, well.. she's tired of the my plan is better then your plan type attitude that seems prevalent..  "You were asking a question," says Keene, settling back on his rock and looking to Alex. "about winnable battles. Let me first tell you what is not a winnable battle: a head-to-head fight against a Technocratic corporation when you don't have a game plan outside of trying to play a game of `keep away'. Perhaps I just wasn't here when this all started, but were any of you going to clean the Node and do something with it before Hyperion came along? I heard it was corrupt for the longest time."  Standingwater lights up his pipe. It sure isn't tobacco in that thing. "I was merely hoping for a delay while the node was moved or destroyed. The destruction of Mecca would also be welcome, but I see no one is up for that either. I'd better start packing my bags. People who sit on their hands will get me killed."  "Abel was going to cleanse it, from what I have heard," Alex comments with a shrug,"I even erased all of the permits that Hyperion had for the site, but no one did anything to follow up on what I did."  "And I'm sure that wasn't suspicous in the least, nor not remedied during the course of a day by producing the original copies," says Keene. He fishes out a second cigarette from his pocket, not lighting it up just yet. "Trying to fight `the system' by doing what amounts to spiking the punch doesn't do anything but piss the Technocrats off and damage Sleepers. This is why I don't go for the head-to-head thing." Keene waves the cigarette through the fire, bringing it back afterward to take a puff. "That and I know when I'm sorely outmatched. You need a large structure behind you to even nick their paint."  "Actually it took them a /bit/ more than a day,"Alex informs with a making a pinching action with his fingers,"I rezoned the land for non-commercial and industrial use. They had to get in and fit that too... And as for working in the system, that is what Virtual Adepts do best. I mean, we have a cabal working in the NSA after all..."  Cally ahems.. "excuse me.. I have a question. Other then the basic premise that the technos own this land and it has a Node, mind telling me why I should bother trying to offer services in getting it? I mean.. honestly.. I've been here a little over a year. I had problems I asked for assistance, and only in one or two situations was help ever offered.. Only once was assistance given. I offered my services other times.. Many times my offers were placed aside.. you know what? don't even bother with Hyperion. Because if apathy can turn a person like me who used to have ideas and drives for this chantry to not give a shit, then those of us who stopped giving a shit a long time ago won't bother helping.. Frankly there is no respect. no interest.. no reason to help another member.. In short we have nothing in common, and no common goal. So we are going to lose here.. Fine.. As for me, so long as it does not interrupt my research, I personally don't care anymore.. I'll throw money and stuff for the chantry like a good little Traddie but frankly.. my heart is not in fighting a losing war.  "I'm very impressed," says Keene to Alex. "But all the same, all it did was cause them some moderate annoyance. Granted, I imagine it was very funny at the time." He puffs on his cigarette, pausing to let Cally speak. He seems to have no comment, since he continues with his thought to Alex. "I deal with individuals rather than trying to challenge the machine directly. The Invisible College tries to stir the people of this world out of intellectual complacency by various means. You may have called them `stunts' or `pranks'. Creating an altered state of consciousness in a person, even for a short time, nurtures the spark within all people to become more than robots. Waking people up, to me, is a much more productive venture than trying to stop a heavily militarized hive-mind driven magic-powered conspiracy with what amounts to a spoon and the Crazy Eye."  Standingwater sighs, "I apologize for wasting your time, Mr. Keene. I just thought this was something the Invisible College would get into. Even just destroying Mecca would help raise spirits around here. Clearly I miscalculated the ability of the College." This said, he falls silent and just puffs away at his pipe.  Alex nods to Cally, shruggin a little as he does. "That is why I have been saying that we need to sit down and decide what it is that the Chantry is doing here. Direction. Goals. A mission statement."  Alex glances over to Keene,"But this heavily militarized hive-mind is working in opposition to what you are trying to do," he pause a moment,"And they are pouring more effort and resources into it than you have to expend."  Keene smokes. "Perhaps," he says. "But that's how it's been for a thousand years. And here we are." He looks at Standingwater for a moment at his statement, but has no immediate reply.  "The Ironteeth have only been working against us... the Traditions for a couple hundred years,"Alex states,"And in that time they have continuously been pushing the Traditions back. Sooner or later the Traditions are going to be pushed up against the wall and crushed, if they do not do something about it."  Cally sighs.. "Alex.. you were not here.. no wait maybe you were.. I tried to shock the group into trying to get into purpose.. I've received nothing but flak.. when I tried to assume the mantle of Leadership,. once I saw no one here bothered. What I got instead was protests and complaints I was infringing on their rights. Jonah came in. He did the same trick yet he was accepted as the leader. Yet tell me. Has anything changed? Has any groups worked? I've gotten some things done with my group, but as a Cabal it's not working. Mr. Keene here is a perfect example of my statement. I suggested an idea, a way to fight the Technocracy, not from the front but from the flank. I listened to what you guys wanted. Time at least to set up the moving of the Node.. Yet only Alex here even considered the idea.. the idea instead was quashed in less then a minute.. the Invisible College? Yeah they are active.. but they are without direction, punks flaunting their power, answering to no one but themselves and no one willing to reign them in.  "You mean this isn't crushed?" asks Keene. "We're sitting on Mars. I imagine we'll have to invest in parkas and hang on Pluto soon enough." He puffs on his cigarette. "Tell you what. I really don't have any ideas about how to reverse what seems to be the consensus of the human cattle out there, but I'll listen to suggestions." He looks to Cally at her comment and smiles benignly. "Such words from one of your lofty station could only be complimentary."  "I was here,"Alex informs Cally,"And your problem was that you tried to take control of the Chantry in place of a departing /elected/ leader. You were viewed as a usurper."  Standingwater just keeps puffing away. Soon his eyes aren't looking at anything within a thousand miles of here. He's not much fun now.  Cally says, "yeah well.. that was a mistake in that the guy who made Dyne Abel and myself his inner circle never bothered to make that public to the Chantry.. Had he done that that would have been worlds easier for explanation.. I wasn;t trying to take over or be an usurper.. merely trying to keep the damn chantry together until someone would take over in a democratic way.. And Keene? Don't patronize allright? I really don't want to hear it.. I spoke my peace.. It may not be true, to you, but to me it is truth.. Quite frankly.. the problem here is no one has any respect for another.. what we have done is degenerated back to the days of the creation of the Order of Reason. you know how we won back then? Because the Traditions, or what will be the Traditions were too busy lording over their own power patting themselves on the back saying how greats they are and never bothered to look out from their castle to see times a changing.. Well.. 700 years later, our Traditions has again found ourselves in that comfortable hole.. quibbling and greedily grabbing for their piece of the rock, without trying to organize and present a unified front. you want Hyperion gone? fine.. you stop trying to work with the Invisible College Mr. Keene, and work on trying to integrate them into the Traditions with the rest of us. you stop pooh poohing ideas that are not your own and listen to other suggestions. the endangered animal thing? Maybe it was not a great idea. I'll admit to that. but it could be a stepping stone TO an idea that can work if you and others took the time to examine it. build on it and see how it or something like it could be used."  Alex looks to Keene,"You yourself have said that what you are doing is just how things have always been. But they have not had any effect in countering the efforts of the Ironteeth. So maybe we need to do something different..."  Keene maintains his peaceful, probably chemically assisted expression. Cally goes on at great length, and he doesn't break character at all. He does pause to smoke about halfway through, but still seems to be paying vague attention to the surroundings. "Duly noted," is his reply to Cally when she concludes her lengthy monologue. Then he moves his attention back to Alex. "As I said. I'll at least let anybody who has an idea present it before I critique it. I'll listen to anything; I don't buy into much."  Cally looks at Jamaia.. "Jamaia.. Can I ask you something?  Standingwater manages to force his gaze back to somewhere within the same universe as the rest of the group. "Ask. I can't promise a good answer."  "Well, the whole point to fighting the construction of the Hyperion Building is to keep the Ironteeth from getting a stronger foothold in the city,"Alex comments with a faint shrug,"/If/ we can do that then maybe your effort, just /might/, have some sort of effect over the people of the city."  "Why is that a concern?" asks Keene. "I have no delusions of grandeur. I don't /want/ to run the world. I'm happy if I can open a few eyes a year. Even a handful of people who don't blindly follow authority and stop to think occasionally improves the quality of human civilization considerably. I work on the micro level -- the macro level is for people who think they *actually* know better."  Cally sighs softly.. "Jamaia.. Playing Devil's advocate.. how would a endangered creature, discovered during construction be reacted to? What would be the outcome, and most importantly how long would there be a delay in construction?  "Because given enough time and apathy on your part, the few people who's eyes you open will be back to blindly follow authority because they are overwhelmed by all of the people that the Ironteeth take over," Alex states rather pointedly,"You think that the Ironteeth as going to just let a few people slip through the cracks?... They want /everything/...."  Keene smokes. "And what do we offer in return? Isn't this all just one large power struggle with both sides having ambiguous moral authority?"  "Well, in this Paradigm War; the Traditions are trying for a paradigm that would still have room for the Technomancers way of... 'life'," Alex states sitting up and crossing his legs,"The Ironteeth have only one way how things should work."  "Interesting," says Keene. "So it is assumed that a global paradigm could be maintained that could encapsulate several wildly divergent paradigms, as well as the present Technocratic establishment?"  Cally glances at Keene and Alex to show she is at least half listening while she politely awaits Jamaia's answer..  Standingwater taps his pipe out into the fire and puts it away. "We'd get a week. Tops. The environment around here is thoroughly cataloged. There is a refuge for nearly every endangered species out there. The only delay would be in identifying the creature and flying in a specialist to pack it up and move it to a refuge."  "I said a Technomancers way of 'life'," Alex clarifies,"Not the authoritive Technocratic establishment." "Did not happen that way in Sydney, only nine years ago,"Alex comments in response to Standingwaters statement.  Cally nods.. "allright a week.. Tell me.. what sort of Environmental impact groups are there here in Canada who would oppose such a move?  Keene gestures broadly. "Of course. That paradigm would be part of this patchwork quilt of paradigms under this mindset." He puffs on his cigarette. "Do you believe that we, as the Nine Traditions, would be able to handle power over the world on that scale without resorting to the tactics the Technocracy has used?"  "How said that we would have power over the world?..." Alex queries,"We would only have to be caretakers. Maintain the status quo."  "Hm," says Keene. "That sounds terribly familiar, doesn't it."  "No... Actually it does not,"Alex states simply as he rests his elbows on his knees.  Standingwater stands and gathers up his gear. Pack. Bow. Good to go. "Your guess is as good as mine. I haven't been in the ecology business in a very long time. Besides, where do you plan to come up with these critters? How are you going to make it look like they've been there for years rather than just being dumped there?"  Keene smokes. "Tell me why not."  "Maintaining a status quo of a diverse paradigm is /nothing/ like what the Ironteeth as trying to do,"Alex explains with wave of his hand,"They have one way of thinking and doing things. And if you do not fit in with their way then they get rid of you."  Keene finishes his cigarette. "And can we really be so sure we wouldn't start using those methods? Without the active threat of the Technocracy, the cohesiveness of the Nine falls apart. The only reason we even work together is out of a desire to survive. Once our individual Traditions started to regain power ... well, I know how the Order is, and I've read my history books."  "Well, I would rather try to do it and fail than just give up and let the Ironteeth win," Alex states with a dark scowl.  Keene flicks his dead cigarette into the fire. "I think they won a long time ago, by the way Paradox seems to work and the existence of television and modern medicine. All that's left are some fragments on the periphery they don't seem to be able to get rid of, but the wagons are pretty much circled." He leans back. "So, as I said earlier, what makes us intrinsically better? Our moral character is not without question. Our cohesiveness is reactive rather than cooperative, ultimately illusory. Further, the concept that the sheep would want to actually want to /work/ -- and that's what magic is, as it requires actual effort and competence -- is counter to everything I know about human nature." He idly picks a piece of dirt out from one of his fingernails. "Thus, I see an impasse on the macroparadigmatic level."  Cally shrugs.. "actually.. I don't know.. I have no experience in the Life spheres.. To be honest, I'm not even sure what sort of endangered creature there is here. Or rather was here..I do know that in the US sanctuaries have been lobbied for Many times successfully. I also know that many companies when exposed to the presence of a undiscovered creature at least in the US, had the property dispute tied up for years. I do know maybe.. the Technos may suspect we did something.. then again, it may not matter. I can promise you this: If you can create an endangered animal, I will help you with researching the perfect one.. for our plans.. " she looks steadily at Jamaia, and then at Alex and Keene. "I can't promise the idea will succeed. But maybe.. it can buy us some extra time.. Particularly if we had others try to stir up media and the public about preserving this animal's habitat. the plan is subtle.. and it may have the advantage to darken the Technocracy, perhaps loosen a few more from the Techno's grip.. My question then is, what would we have to lose? what sort of risks would there be? the animal we create, even if moved would still live and help repopulate a species that would almost be wiped out.. We could get an injunction to freeze Hyperion's efforts.. and the Technocracy would not be able to attack us directly thus giving us a chance to win without looking like the criminals here.  Alex shakes his head and stands,"Whatever..." he says and turns to head for the keep.  Standingwater slings the pack over his shoulder and heads off to the lake. "Sorry. Can't help you. Creating endangered creatures is beyond my skill."  "Have a nice day," Keene says pleasantly to Alex.  Alex begins down the hill, ascending the other. He opens the doors to the structure, heading inside. Alex has left.  Keene stares into the fire for a while after Alex leaves, speaking only after he's out of sight. "I can't do much for you, even if I particularly felt inclined to. Nobody I know can make living animals either."  Standingwater heads down the hill and follows the stream toward the lake in the distance. Standingwater has left.  Cally sighs.,. and shakes her head.,. and looks at Keene. "and you have now witnessed why we are going to lose. Because you know the damning thing? One of us can do it.. Or even know someone who can do it.. but it's easier to give up. wash their hands.. so.. I'm going to join the growing mass. wash my hands of it.. If you have any idea and can pull it off. Well give me a call.. Otherwise, I said my piece and tried my best. Sorry it wasn't good enough.  "It's alright," Keene says, looking into the fire. "You have a nice evening, now."  Alex wanders out of Novus Valnastium in the distance, slowly closing ground until he has arrived in the heart of the fields. Alex has arrived.  Several minutes later, Alex exits the keep and makes his way across the rolling hills to the cavern. He pauses a moment to look back at Novus and then turns to head into the cavern. Alex heads down the hill and up the other, disappearing into the cavern's darkness. Alex has left.  Keene sits in front of the fire for a while. Then, after kicking some dirt onto it to put it out, he steps off and heads back towards the real world. Such as it is. "Ta."  Cally nods and sighs as SHE STANDS THERE . seems SHE HAS SOME DECISIONS TO MAKE.  >> Keene leaves. >> Alex leaves a note.  ============================= Mage - Traditions ============================= Message: 46/93                     Posted        Author Good Luck                          2003 May 22   Alex -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    Tradition Members, I have decided that the Traditions are a lost cause.
