         Pandora's Box - Pool Hall       The ceiling is set high with churning metal fans. The blades churn a thick  haze of smoke from cheap cigars and the pungent aroma of sweat mixed with stale  spilt beer. The bar runs the length of the far wall much like a saloon in an old  western. A polished brass foot-rail gleams in the fading light of the occasional  dropped match and guttering cigarette butt.       Many of the patrons watch each other with looks of a cautious calculation. Not  only are those opposite the pool table viewed with suspicion, but also the few one  might mistake as a friend. A darkness of nefarious deed reigns within the shadows  as the lighting illuminates from the mouth down. It is as though the dark conspires  to hide the intent deep within the eyes from the light of revelation. Then again  the windows to these souls only come up black.                                   NIGHTZONE                                                            --> Places and view enabled.   Contents: Eddie   Penny's all alone at the bar. Backlit by the jukebox, her jacket turns different  colors; blue, muddy yellow, bright orange. Everyone else seems to be enjoying their  night. peoplecleaning up at the tables, getting decent service (lip, drink and  otherwise) but not Penny. Surrounding her, a cloud of smoke and another imagined  somewhere above. The hangdog expression does a lot to explain things as do the  number of empty shot glasses lined up in front of her.  This is a long night and these are necessary evils.  Eddie walks in, he does. Counting bills already like a gremlin. Hunger forcing him  to participate in small games with small people. Perhaps not the best night scope a  joint for local suckers, given the scarcity of actual pool playing going down in this pool hall. No cocky green studs with their own sticks. Those are the easiest. Those are the ones that'd jump to throw a game Voodoo's way. Some brown dude with a stolen outfit, underfed, and dirty. Comin' in off the streets to step into a white  man's game. They'd pounce.   But they're not here tonight. So Eddie allows his gaze to drift once this is noted.   Penny shifts on the stool and the headphones looped and hanging off its back follow  gravity, slithering into a loose pile of wire and plastic on the poolhall floor.  Mingling with cigarette butts, spilled beer and the glint of canadian pennies, the  headphones tilt and open flat, kicked underfoot by someone else drunker than Penny. Drunk enough not to notice the loss or the molded pieces of plastic cracking under the pressure of a rough and stumbling foot.  She's busy, damnit. Penny is busy making a dent in their worst whiskey. Bottom of  the barrel, rot gut, acid breath. In her left hand she has poised the next shot.  Wet, dirty and possibly ashed in,her hand is listless. A boney trap of spindly long  fingers and in her right is a cigarette. Unlit.  Over to the overworked. Eddie steps to the plate, stuffing away funny colored  money. The bright pinks and reds associated with far off places. Mainly because  there's no fish in the sea tonight, he won't need the shiny lure. A moment to look  presentable as he switches over from business to one of the few remaining lords of  leisure. Dude does that thing with the licking, and his first and last finger, and  the running them over his eyebrows in different directions.   "Hija." Eddie pretends he's not quite sure it's Penny, that girl that fucked his  game. One hand holds the lapel of his jacket in place when he leans over her at the  bar. Scavenger inspecting a bit of luck.  Oh yeah, that's all you. Slick and even. And Penny? She's all tough jawed, determined. Girl's on a mission; a kind of localized vietnam; wandering through the foreign jungles of a deep, deep alcoholic persuasion. Was that a hiccup or a hello - hard to determine under the whinging of certain other elements in the thinly populated bar tonight - a younger, irresponsible crowd. They type that are always 'on something,' always paying too much for entertainment, getting ripped off by the strung-out waitress and wondering in a passive way what exactly happened to a grand in a night.  Yes, the noise peaks and coughs. Sounds that span the room before they drift down to a bass and acceptable treble. And her hand has barely moved; elbows on the bar, liquid rolling into the fleshy white space between her thumb and forefinger. "Hnn," unable to make her mouth do the talking.  "Ju lookeen..." Well, she looks like shit. "Excellente." Slime. He'd say that to anything. Eddie smiles through the layers of grease that coat his soul. 'There's  somethin' up', you'd be thinkin'. "Can I seet weet ju'?" Fingers uncoil towards the  stool over, one between the prospective bar mates. For good measure. It's all  polite, his approach. Designed specifically for an affirmative or agreeable reply  of sorts. To get him in the door. To get him closer to your paper.  Penny wraps her fingers down around the shotglass. The motion bringing to mind two very specific gestures: the first - a pitcher looking for the sweet spot on the ball and the second - combat oriented reloading, middle and index fingers finding the bottom of the glass. The middle and index tip-shoving the glass into place at the precipice of her lip. She drops her head back and makes it quick, the reflex flinch almost entirely absent - possible she's done enough she's not tasting it.  Setting down the glass to the bar Penny swipes those same two fingers across her shirt, left to right, slurring something in a vague and breakable english "Y'c'gme a li, yah."  At some point, Hiro -- a beacon of pure, shining light amidst the darkness of dark  deeds and dark thoughts ... no. Scratch that. He's just dressed like some kind of  fairy, and is wearing one of those queer temple headlamps. Regardless, he  materializes at Penny's elbow; flicking the goddamn lamp off when he notices the  brooding patrons fixing him with their steely, opaque soul-windows. Which is good,  because the illumination -- once one is accustomed to the oozing inky blackness of  darkville -- was nearly blinding.         "'ey, Pensy," he prompts.  "Como que no." The approach; worked as intended. Hannibal loves it when a job comes together. Eddie has been granted parlay, an audience with drunk party chic. A shiny loafer swings over the seat; dude plants his flag and goes for some matches. Matches with two sticks left, only one in working order. With a bit of luck, he doesn't need the second one anyways. Luck is his venue. Fire for Penny.   Boyo sits a seat over from her, allowing the stool between to act as the platonic  friend pillow guard in a sleepover. Eddie leans over to hand off the burning match.  On that side of the hall are the normal intricacies of the human condition. The simple drink, smoke and flirtation; a casual night out for a Canadian. And like those that traffic in weather and good tidings, they - Penny and Eddie and Hiro together perhaps - seem to exist on the other side of the screen. A strangeness pervades but doesn't move beyond them; the way she drinks is to excess, the way she smokes is indecent - the way she leans across the stool for the light with her whole body, a tattooed arm extended across to even out the keel, the cut of her hair falling off her face, off her wet cheek; an accident - an envelope full of glitter opening. Even the way she bends backward into Hiro before she's fully aware he's there.       "Rosy hm, this is my friennnnd" leaving an opening for an introduction.  Hiro scrubs the back of his hand across his nose, sniffing once, and offers it to  Eddie over Penny's shoulder. "'ey, whatsit," he murmurs, snapping his fingers - as  if to indicate a handshake should be immediate. He comes across as agitated and  nervous and paranoid and full of confidence - a chemical cocktail riding the horse  in place of a personality. "'s Hiro."  A gross whistling noise as Eddie's tongue sucks out the remains of his cheap dinner  from between incisors. Eddie's attention shifts to the colored pig.  The handshakes offered up, even if it forces Voodoo to touch the puerco sooner than he intended. His pace is a tad slower; his words end up waiting till all other actions  are accomplished. "How ju' doeen', 'm Eddie homes." Mexicans slaughtered his native accent in lockdown.  All hands where she can see them, Penny's eyes drift toward the bartender. The way he looks back at her says a couple of things about the place; they don't cut you off here. And they especially don't cut you off if you've got friends. Having a five second quiet moment Penny's eyes drift toward her navel, swung out and leaning half on Hiro, half on the barstool. "Same?" even as she nods yes, already with the bottle in hand, he starts refilling the shot glasses in front of her. No sense in dirtying up new ones but then she asides to the bartender "Cup'l fer these two." New glasses afterall. Lowball - they're all out of the tiny tumblers. Lazy, Penny drags and exhales across Hiro's head, working out the numbness from her tongue "Almost godlike, habatcho?"  Hiro's hand clasps, shifts, snaps off the fingertips. He rocks back on his heels as  he extracts the digit; wedging it back into his labcoat pocket. Not much movement;  just this perpetual slouch that forces him to address Eddie around -- no, more  eclipsed by -- Penny. He tilts his head to the side, regarding the lush sidelong.  "Tuesday, huh?"  Settling back into the counter, the valet. Perceptive. Inside words. Whatever they  mean. Eddie will watch for a moment, using his decoder ring went needed. Tuesday  bit, foreign. The brown man isn't hip. This allows for a brief inventory check. Pat  the jacket, bundle's there. Pat the front pant-leg pocket, keys. Taking stock. Dude  finally reaches out for the bar pretzels as gnaws on a few.  Penny finds it funny, smiles when Hiro says it. She snifs like maybe she needs to blow her nose and bobs her head back and forth; some variation of yes. When she opens her mouth to speak again, Penny already has the next shot lined up.  "Was supposed to go to this funeral with Days. Plan was we get medicated," pointing this out for Eddie's edification "you can never last through those things, all those handshakes" emphasizing the word on its first syllable - /hand/, flickflicking an ash down by her knee, somewhere in the dark between the bar and Hiro's thigh "but she never came to get me so I figured," talking mostly to Hiro's orbiting head "why not stay? Chin chin old chap" annunciating tight-lipped in a laughable east-ender accent, Penny snatches a shot and knocks it down.  A hand manifests, bearing one of Daisy's cheap GPCs, and Hiro plucks Penny's  cigarette from between her fingers, using it to light his own. "Ms. A," he states,  rather than asks. He knows which funeral. "The pig said I shouldn't go." The  cigarette is offered for Penny's retrieval. "Guess I won't. He said she was  watching me." He makes a scissor-cutting motion with index and middle fingers;  snaps again. "Like she wanted to do that. Girl was crazy. Loved her, but she was  crazy."  By this time i'd assume the other two drinks P ordered had arrived. That's a  novelty, relative strangers aiding in one's inebriation. Eddie seems quite pleased  to accept the fire water when it arrives, greeting the drink with one cheeked  puffed with munched pretzels. A few remain untouched in the palm of his hand. "Very nice." Nods, he's pleasant and giving thanks despite talk of corpses. A sip to  punctuate his approval of shit whiskeys.  "That pig has a point," infering something like agreement in a low voice, fingers held still to receive the cigarette again. The bartender approaches, murmuring "My shifts's over," hedging for a tip "so maybe you wanna close out your tab?" Penny nods a little, sure-suring him but makes no moves to reach for a wallet or anything that looks like she's pulling money out. Just nods her head and lips the cigarette, continuing when he backs off "besides they /all/ are, take Jesse" for example, she implies, clipping her words "disappears for months at a time doing stuff we can't exactly y'know, talk'bout with the PTA." Penny waves her cigarette around, pontificating and rolling her eyes. Unsteady. "I mean and they want us to act surprised.. stunned... amazed? Uh uh."  Maybe it's the hour and maybe she has a bullseye on her somewhere - some invisible 'tag' sign on her back; whatever it is, it's attracting all the wrong attention and suddenly there's some acne-faced kid standing there. Wall-eyed and grinning like he's at the spring formal getting up the nerve to ask her something. Did he think she was gesturing at him? Lidded, Penny pulls herself together and rasps "What?"  "Thought maybe we could y'know, dance."  There's other people way in the back - they're "dancing" too; a few couples crushed into eachother in the dark. She reeks but Penny is nothing if not indulgent. She spins off the stool and winks broadly over her shoulder at Hiro, leaving him to get chummy with Eddie for a few. Call it a sixth sense but there's a hundred and ten percent chance she'll have the money to cover the tab and then some by the time she gets back.  Bacon and whiskey, fine company. Even if Hiro isn't a white chic. The awkward  silence of two people left at the bar together ensues. Nether know each other for  shit. Friends of friends and that. Not that he knows Penny at all ether.   Eddie looks over to Hiro. A sip of cheap booze fills the void between them. "Pal a  jers get dead recently?" There's a curious starting point.
