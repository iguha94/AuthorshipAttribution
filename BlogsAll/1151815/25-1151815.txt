         **Penny and Compton do some more research in to happenings at Hyperion**  U of T - Courtyard(#532RJ)       The large circular driveway which circles the U of T courtyard appears as if it has been recently paved. In the daytime, close to a hundred student cars line the sides of the roadway, silent under the the slender trees. Students of every colour and ethnic background wander back and forth to their classes or sit, smoking, on the steps of the Sanford Fleming Building. Just to the north, a large circular expanse of grass turns the courtyard into a cul-de-sac. On the other side of the field the great dome of Convocation Hall dwarfs the surrounding brownstone buildings. Just to your left you see University College Residence, a large square featureless building. Utilitarian grey paint covers the outside of this institutional looking building, the only visible decorations being a number of posters and signs taped to the inside of their dorm windows. Facing this bland building, is one of the oldest buildings on the U of T Campus, the Sir Sanford Fleming building. The old brownstone building seems to have been recently renovated, and a bright blue sign on the small patch of grass in front of it confirms this fact. At night the campus is all but deserted, yet brightly illuminated with security lights. Haggard looking students wander the campus, looking as if they've just escaped the Siberian salt mines, some of them acknowledging the security guards who go about their rounds.  Contents: Dunce Campus Courtyard Bulliten Board  Penny picks up her cellular phone and begins to dial.  Dunce sits on the library stairs, reading.  Penny holds something small out in front of her. Looks like a phone. She stares at it, squints at it like it's supposed to be doing something. But clearly it isn't.  Compton from the other end of the line grumbles a vauge hello.  Penny stands neaby the bulletin boards, moves slowly to lean on one of it's posts and puts the phone to her ear again. She sticks her other hand in her pocket and juts that hip out from the wall; balance of a kind rocking heel-to-toe as she talks.  The room, despite basic descriptions is a bloody mess. 4 to 5 people have shared this space for a while now. There's a large hole burned in the carpet between the beds. Compton is sitting on the edge of the far bed talking on the phone, cradling his head in his hands, from the reciver can be heard Penny's shrill voice which seems to visibly hurt Compton, it says "Yeah so I think I've got something here. Need to you to look at it, maybe make some changes. You hear about that accident the other night?", to which Compton grumbles a dull, "Uh, no... big fucking city ya know?" in return.  Downtown - Spadina and Dundas W(#263RJ) Penny's voice on the phone is overly-loud. She volleys with "Would you FUCKING WAKE UP. Jesus. Fucking motor oil for brains. And get Keene. He should see, too. Look," she pauses, sounds like she's walking down a busy street. A jangle of noises; street vendors and hissing steam, busses and people. Must be Chinatown. "I'm coming back now, okay? Plastered the campus with flyers again - should be a better turn out than last week. Get dressed. And you better not be in my robe. That shit's new."  Downtown - Spadina and Queen W(#261RJ) Compton jerks the phone away from his stricken head, and listens to the rest of Penny's diatribe with the phone on his lap. He looks down and realizes that he is in fact not in Penny's robe, but in last nights clothes still. Next Compton peers at the detrius of the room around him, and eventually calls to the can, "Keene? You there?" to no reply. Raising the receiver cautiously to his head he says, "Keene's not here. I think."  She sneezes and curses and yells "Hey, I'm WALKIN'here!" away from the phone - it's muffled and covered in wind-noises. She must be pointing the phone at whoever just tried to run her over. Suddenly all background noise is cut off; like she stepped inside a vacuum. "Comp? You still there? I'm here. Open the door, forgot my key again."   Penny knocks on the door marked .  Compton hangs up the phone without another word. Gets up and crosses the room to the door, twists the knob and lets it swing oipen on his way tot he bathroom next to it. IN there the sound of a steady and heavy steam hitting the bowl resonanates for a couple of minutes. Finished witha lough moan/sigh of relife. You enter the apartment.  Room174(#4497ed)       To the right of the entrance is a modest bathroom that is sparkling clean. This room has two queen-sized beds separated by a few feet, with plenty of blankets and large fluffy pillows. Inside the second drawer of the nightstand that sits between the beds is a copy of Gideon's Bible. Across from the nightstand on the far wall is a TV that offers hours of cable entertainment. A note near the TV remote reminds you that pay-per-view adult movies will be added to your bill.      There is a window that overlooks the parking lot on the far side, next to a table with two chairs. Behind the table is the room environmental unit built into the wall, giving you control of the heat and air conditioning.                                                   Obvious Exits: Out    Contents: Escalus Compton Dave the Monkey % Activity in world legacy "So, whatchew got for me." come from the Bathroom which Compton occupies at the moment.   Escalus says "Guys, I have ten minutes until lunch."   Escalus says "I will be back, afterwards."  Penny looks down both ways before walking in the way people do when they know there's a boobytrap waiting to be sprung on them. Or not. She continues cautiously, still looking around the room. There's Keene's laptop. There's Jesse's sleepingbag. There's Pobble's box. "Where's that goddamn monkey? He *better* still be bound and gagged." Sneaks a look among Jesse's crates of lps. "In that closet," pokes through Hiro's amps "Locked in the box," insinuating she'll try to kill him again, Penny shuffles toward the second bed, shrugging out of her jacket.  "Comp?" knowing he's tuned her out for the better part of the rant "Daze said she's bringin'home dinner later. Come out, wanna show you."  OOC Compton says "No worries. Sorry for the wait." OOC Penny says "We can keep ourselves occupied - how long'll you be? - so we can tailor our rp,.." OOC Escalus says "I will be back 1 hour and ten minutes from now. But I am enjoying the scene."  The gutteral glug-glug of the toilet flushing heralds Comptons return to the other part of Thi Invisible College's palace. He's looking alright actually, everything considered seeing how he has most likel;y just come off a bender with various heavy metals. His fly still down though, so at least there's a sense of inoperability still around. "McRaunchy's again? Fuck, stuff gives me the shits." is his opening comment. Nice.  Stretched out on the bed, Penny's skin is still slick from the fog outside. She looks strange; pale slithery thing, hollow eyed and bone shallow. Sunk low, she unpockets her phone and tosses it to the floor. "My turn, right? Throw us a towel." Rolling that way, she pulls open the drawer and clips herself a tab. "Thought maybe I was seeing things, big crash outside the quay" tongues the square off her thumb "go into my pocket and look at that. Guy totally flipped out and ran some people over.."  And afterward, looking at the ceiling "Xyz, man." Compton glances at the ceiling with you, looking for the Zee'sis for a moment before clueing in and closing the barn door. Grabbing any old towel from the end of the other bed he drops it on you when he plunks down next to you on the bed. "Kay. Sounds pretty heavy."  "Was," affirming that "Looked over and They said it wasn't nothin' they could sense so I kinda kept on but y'know that feeling?" She wipes the towel over her head, face and neck "That one where you know something just isn't right.. had this intuition. So" she hitches back onto an elbow "took that picture. Lookit," nodding to the polaroid coming out of her jacket's inner-pocket.  Compton grins at the sight of the 'Polaroid' before even looking at the picture, "Picking up soem tricks of the old guy eh?" he asks in usual Canadian parlance. Then he looksd at the photo and sees...? It looks likee a regular old car accident. Busted up vehicle in a lightpole, inured people on the sidewalk, unconcious driver, blood everywhere. General mayhem.  She smiles some, going gently into her altered state "Shoulda SEEN this woman," exaggerating details in drawn-out words "Biiiig frilly dress comin'out of the Eaton Center. Totally into letting me borrow her stuff. Didn't have any'a your equipment, can't do that shit with the lights but maybe you can poke at it with your sticks, make it show us something."  "Somthing?" Compton asks skeptically, and scowells at the photo as if willing it to just give up to goods and save him the hassell. "Will take a while." he adds defending his technical skills with a expectation buffer. "What are we looking for?"  Her vaguest response yet, looking at the ceiling, the smoke detector. "Something in the air." Penny shifts herself a little and sneezes the other way. "'mind me to get a damn hat. Fucken weather." She grouses and grumbles, then settles back down. "We could sell'em," indicating the pile of polaroids "Or copies at least. Tabloids love this shit."  Compton continues to glare at the 4x4 picture as he gets up and moves over to the heap in the closet and begins to rummage, pulling out a duffle bag.  Escalus has connected. From the bag, Compton pulls his rusty-trusty Ether Goggles. Returning to Keene's desk he sits down and dons them, using the erstwhile leaders Notebook as a spot to work on. Penny loses all interest in keeping her eyes open, starts humming something to herself. Indistinct at first, the tune builds into something recognizable. Flight of the Bumble Bee. It goes on like this for ten minutes; every other stanza interrupted by a sneeze or a cough. Finally she gets up and blows her nose with the last tissue in the box. She notices. She's subtle.  "You need to cut that out."  "You don't have to do it now. Got something else in mind." Clearing her sinuses, Penny grabs a marker on the way into the bathroom. OOC Penny says "Hi :) Welcome back."  Compton props the goggles up on his forehead and scowels at Penny, fucking flake that she is. "What you on today woman?" he asks with mounting annoyance.  From the bathroom, Penny's disembodied voice echos "Wednesday."  Curt and to the point, that's all she says, all she needs to say. Some noises follow; clearing space, knocking empties into the garbage can, toothbrushes and hairbrushes and combs clicking with their plasticky static into the bathroom sink. "Eep'ose og. Oo igh'eed'en." Something impeding real annunciation. Marker in her mouth.  Compton pockets the Polaroid, and gets up witha grunt of effort from the all too small chair for his big ass and trundles off to the loo to see what Penny's up to this time. "Huh?" is his response to your ooglings. The googles still on his mellon regardless.  OOC Penny says "You with us Esc?" OOC> Escalus says "Indeed, yes." OOC> Penny says "Kay, this is where my speshul talents come in." OOC> Escalus is waiting with baited breath. OOC Compton waits with fish. OOC Penny says "PHENOMENON - When Compton comes into the bathroom, Penny is going to close the door behind him. She has markered up the doorframe with the vacant lot's address. This is the door's new 'target' - it opens into the lot instead of Room 174. ACTION - Penny is using the doorway focus for the Corr/Matter effect to take place. THEORY - This was one of the last trick Penny turned to graduate from Benny's tutelage - a doorway is just another frame - another window out into the world. Turning the knobs and hinges out of a door is easy - they tell the door where you want it to open - it's all in the wrist." OOC> Penny corrects: it opens into the lot's umbral representation. OOC> Escalus says "Oooh. You do realize, however, that you do not have the spirit necessary to handle material. Compton does, however. You can sense across the barrier with spirit 1, but not move across it." OOC> Penny says "Right. Which is why he's in here with me. Ethernaut." OOC> Compton bristles with helpfulness. OOC> Escalus says "Allright, with you working together, Penny, you can add 1 auto success to each roll that Compton makes. This will be a difficulty 6 arete roll. Would you like to spend quint or willpower, and will you make it an extended roll?" OOC> Penny says "Yes." OOC> Compton does too, to be helpful, and because he never rolls well. :P OOC> Escalus says "Penny, you are not actually rolling, so you cannot spend WP. Sorry." OOC> Penny says "Rats!" OOC> Escalus says "Okay, Compton, you have two auto successes. Roll vs. diff. 6." //.etro: Compton rolls "arete" at diff 6          For a total of 0 success(es). OOC> Escalus says "You have two successes." OOC> Compton gets down to biz now. Sorry. OOC> Escalus says "You can draw, with that, some spirit stuff into this room." //.etro: Escalus rolls "6" at diff 8          For a botch! Compton lowers the goggles over his eyes as he realizes what Penny is up to by the glyphics she's scrawled around the door. Standing firmly in front of the prepared portal he opens the door and gazes beyond.  Flick of the wrist, Penny opens the door. Only it's no longer the sty of the Holiday Inn. Instead it's perennial twilight out there in the OtherSpace. "Okay, now don't go too far. There's something out there - looks like brick only not. Get it, bring it back."  OOC> Escalus says "Where did you get the idea that they woudl be bricks?" OOC> Penny says "Makin'it up." OOC> Escalus says "'Kay! :D" OOC> Penny :)  Penny is totally unconvincing - she doesn't sound like she knows what she's talking about but she's into it. She's enthusiastic. She's psyched it worked.  So what're we looking at - what do we see?  "Penny. Go in to the bag (the one he brought in with him, that everyone hadn't noticed until now), and pass me the gloves." Compton instructs quickly.  The brick sits quiescent in the umbra, since both of you can see it.  The gloves in question being an old pair of hockey gloves, that have several meters of sterio wire wrapped around the fingers and wrists, where they meet a couple of 9V batteries duct taped around the KOHO logos at the arm band.  Penny yanks them out of the sack, nose turned up "You gotta dead rat in there? Shit man, supposed to air this stuff out before you put it away. Here.." hands them over without another comment.  The block is still unmoving. Just spirit matter floating where you put it.  Compton reaches back, and picks at the seat of his pants, adjusting a wedgie apparently, before taking the gloves and putting the two of them on. The first one goes on easy, the second one not-so as he had to negotiate it with the other glove. The he steps forward and reaches in to Otherspace with both hands, as if plucking a loaf from the oven.  Compton reaches back, and picks at the seat of his pants, adjusting a wedgie apparently, before taking the gloves and putting the two of them on. The first one goes on easy, the second one not-so as he had to negotiate it with the other glove. The he steps forward and reaches in to Otherspace with both hands, as if plucking a loaf from the oven.  The spirit-stuff is soft and spongy to the touch, just as you expect it would be.  Penny waits there like a kid looking for cookies. "Hurry up with that. Don't want anything sneakin'.. " Penny on the lookout. She's watching everything. "Come on already."  Compton steps back now, in his gloved hands the etherical tofu cube.  Penny tilts her head, staring. She slams the door fast and starts scrubbing at the writing on the frame with a toothbrush. Toothpaste smell festers in the air; minty fresh.  Compton stands there, blast goggles still on and his industiral oven mits and says, "Um, where d'ya want it?" and turns to put 'it' down on the edge of the tub, to those not seeing in to the other realm, it just looks as if he'd doing some weird-ass mime routine.  You say, "What's it feel like?" She scrubs harder, moving the ink, destroying the link. "In there, in there. Put it there," looking over her shoulder at the tub. "Is it alive?"  Alive? That is an interesting question. As Penny destroys the link you can take the stuff and putt in where you want in your spirit world. It just moves there.  Compton says, "I dunno... what's alive feel like?" Compton asks, and knowing him it would prolly mean a strippers boob pressed up again his face, in fact except for the shape, that's kinda what if eeels like it dawn on him, "Like a square tit." is his final summarization of the experience."  The spirit stuff is rather pliable. Kinda like a thick play-doh.  Penny grabs a washcloth and wipes down the doorway til it's back to white. She looks down at her own and fingers the edge of her shirt "That's what came out of that Thing, made the screaming. It's not a *boob*, you boob. I.." squinting at it, or the space where it is, "..wonder. You remember that time we were in Jesse's place and he was talkin'some garbage about things taking their own form?"  Compton says, "I know it's not a boob, I said it felt like one."  Compton pulls off the gloves and pushes the goggles back up on to his forhead, looking back at Penny, "Um, huh?" is his brillant response to her Jesse inquiry.  "Well look at it. That's not how it started out, is it? Nothing natural about it," Penny, leaping to conclusion, sits on the edge of the tub leaving the toilet, seat and lid down, for Compton to sit on. "What is it... is it 'the word made flesh'? Fuck, Daze's never around .. " Then, "Gimme a cigarette."  Escalus has disconnected. Escalus has connected.  OOC> Escalus says "Sorry about that." OOC> Compton says "Sokie. I got a shower in at least. :D" OOC> Escalus had to disconnect because a patron came in. What were you doing? OOC> Compton says "No poses since you left. Penny and me are throwing out ideas as to whay our new found spirit thingy pet is." OOC> Escalus says "I will allow a int + occult roll, diff. 8." OOC> Penny says "ugh. BACK!" OOC> Penny's machine crashed like three times.  Compton frowns and just nods along to your stream of counsiousness, and offers a useless, "I don't know" here and there, before scowling at Penny, "You know... Sooner of later one of you kids will realize, I don't smoke, until that time let me give you a hint..." then his eyes unfocus a bit and he stares off in tot he void as his brain tries to grunt out a thought....  //.etro: Compton rolls "intelligence+occult" at diff 8          For a total of 0 success(es). No entry for '+roll'. OOC> Penny says "Me next?" ...and comes up with jack shit, as usual. OOC> Escalus says "Yep." //.etro: Penny rolls "intelligence + occult" at diff 8          For a total of 3 success(es) including 2 ten(s).  Penny remembers that spirit ephemera is essentially nothing until it gains a sort of resonance depending on what happens in the materials world around it. For example, a church that stood on a spot for 150 years gains a certain degree of reality in the spirit world, one that can continue after the material church is destroyed. Right?  "Old man," a whine, a warning. "It's not for me, I mean if I could just ask one'a them it'd be easier than staring at this thing all day." But that's what she does. Penny stares this way, that way. She looks up, she looks down; fixated on some central point of origin.  OOC> Escalus says "You follow me so far?" OOC> Penny follows. OOC> Compton does. OOC> Compton isn't quite as thick as his IC persona :P  Sentient spirits are products of millenia of that sort of spirit-material collusion. For example, lunes are spirits made by the connection between the material moon and the real moon, which is very potent in the mind and spirit of man.  This stuff is most probably spirit ephemera rendered neutral. The interaction between a material object and its spiritual counterpart has been removed, and the "imprint" of the soul's relationship between spiritual and material has been erased.  Compton frowns, grumbles and hauls his ass off the can and shuffles off out in to the rest of the room. The sounds of rummaging and things crashing to the floor can be heard as he ruthlessly looks for tobacco products. After a long quiet moment, he calls back, "And it wouldn't because you happened to be out of them, right?".  "No, not at all," looking at the walls. "Oh." "God." "That's why they were screaming."  Penny bends over a little to poke at what she can't touch, unable to interact with it, her fingers drift slowly across the empty tub. "It's ..it's clay. You know what this is old man? it's a fucking hard drive. It's a big block of memoryspace," she shivers and gets off the tub, goes to meet Compton halfway "it's empty. That's why they were screaming. All torn apart. Peter Pan and his shadow," making some kind of corollation she takes the cigarette from him and lights up on her own, matches tucked back into her pocket "You think I'd make a good Wendy?"  Compton tosses the pack he found back over by Keene's notebook. "OKay... well, I guess the next question is, why?"  Compton doesn't seem particularly upset by this. His connection to the spirit world having always eebn one of utility and not, um, spirit. He then guffaws, "Hee, Wendy."  Penny smirks a little, the hotel sewing kit in plain sight on the bathroom counter. "Obviously they're bent on getting something rooted in there good and proper. Solid-like. Stealing material like that, god. It's sick. Sick. There's gotta be karma for shit like that... "  Compton grabs the bag, and collects the gloves from the edge of the tub where he left them. Putting them in to the bag he gazes at the 'empty' tub and shrugs. "They're making a building from ectoplasim?" he asks trying to clairfy what you're babbling about.  Penny bobs her head back and forth, a veering nod "Kinda sorta, yeah. They're building something but they're doing it on a festering node. I dunno," waving a pattern of smoke around her face, leaning on the wall outside the bathroom "Something just isn't right. I mean that material BELONGS to something other than whatever new purpose they're trying to make it serve. Wouldn't wanna be around when it tries to repossess itself." She drags long and slow ".. not me, man. They're crazy."  Compton sratched at his forhead, thinking. Getting marks for effort, if not results on this one, "Right..." he says, "BUt They don't just do things for kicks like that. They doing it for a reason... Okay, so they got a sick node. And now they have a lot of blank ectoplasma. Either they are trying to make corrupted ephemera or a clean node." Points at the empty tub, "Ya think they're using this stuff as sponges?"  You say, "Sponges," repeats the word, musing "there's easier, less destructive ways of getting a spill cleaned up. If you had heard what I heard?" a hurting, a wincing lilt in the exhale "Maybe if we can get our hands on all this stuff first we can get it sorted. Think we should? Isn't creating a problem to fix a problem a problem in and of itself?"  Compton says, "I guess the next question is: How much of this stuff have they made?"  Penny walks across the room and opens the window, letting the air circulate back into the room. "I'm thinking a lot. Which means there's a lot of displaced information somewhere else." She ashes on the windowsill and leans there, kicking off her shoes. "Probably on that ship. Where the fuck did it go?"  Compton pads over to the far bed, and does the little hop-up flop-down on the bed. The coil protesting loudly.  > "Well... where did it come from? You're the one that saw it come in." Compton says, "And further more, what use would they have keeping the... 'other halfs' if this ectoplasm is all they wanted...If I were them I'd just dump it."  You say, "Deep space," she ashes again into the sill and presses her palm down for balance, balast. Her other boot comes off, focused inward a little "..but where do you dump something like that? Way the fuck out there, that's where. It's not like orange peels - the identity of a spirit can't just disintegrate."  "That's not what Daze said." Compton counters. "She said old spirits are fading away all the time. The Easter Bunny for example... but then she's usually full fo shit anyways. But assuming what she said is right, then dumping it somewhere would work as eventually it'd just fade... Unless they're reprocessing the other halves too... Hell, could even be using them for fuel." That last point can out far more erie than he meant.  Keene has connected. You say, "She thinks they fade outta unbelief - old gods, the Mithras cults, things like out. Fade outta disuse. But .. that's not what I meant. I'm saying they've still got some .." pinching her fingers, sliding them together "consistancy. That' block," nodding toward the bathrooom "that's proof. One can exist without the other but we don't know for how long and what the longterm effects are. Like I said.."  Compton tucks his thick arms under his head as an added pillow and gazes at the ceiling, "What did you say?" he asks distractedly.  Penny keeps rubbing her fingers against her thumb, laughing quietly to herself. In the grip of it, pin-points for eyes, Penny hasn't seen Keene come in. Penny is unaware. "I said I wouldn't wanna be there for the happy reunion of spirit'n blocky. Listen, we should definitely go back and get more. They're fucking with my bread and butter here."  "It'd be easier with some help." the big guy admits, "Will take a while to grab each one by hand. Could make a ecto-magnet or somthing. Just suck it all here in one go... But I thought you said you don wanna be around where the two rejoin, and won't you be if we fill the bathroom with it?"  There's a long silence. The ash on her cigarette burns down to the filter, singes her out of whatever reverie.  "You have a point."  "Maybe we can hide it on them. Put it somewhere they can't find it. They're playing dirty, is what, and I don't like it. Shouldn't be this easy for them. Why the fuck is it so easy for them?"  Compton snorts "Should dump it in the realm. Let those fuckholes actually do somthing useful for once."  "Fuckholes." Says something quietly, underneath the bed.  Penny stops moving altogether, filter falling from her hand.  "I.thought.you.said.it.was.in.the.fucking.closet."  Penny looks about ready to jump out the window. Compton is grinning now, "I never said anything actually.... Mornin Dave." Compton says out in to the room.  "I fucking hate you, I hate you I HATE you old man." She gets up in the windowsill, inching her hand down the wall to grab one of her boots. Paranoid, she does it fast and holds it close to her chin "Don't you let it near me. You hear, Dave? You leave me alone. I'm in no fucking mood."  Compton props hismself up on one elbow and looks on incrediously. He's seen Penny in most her moods. Even freaked out,but this is just bizzare, "What's the problem?"  Penny tucks the boot behind her and grabs the other one. Her eyes are narrowed, a dizziness overtakng her sense of center, Penny starts to keel off the sill. Wait. No. She's stepping down into the boot. She's grabbing the other one and putting it on "Dave. Don't come out Dave. I'm leaving. You hear me? Don't come out or I'll be forced to do something." All this said as she edges toward the door to the room.  Compton swings his legs off the bed and hunches down looking under it, "What's the big deal Pens? It's just a monkey..." he says in all ingnorance, as he sticks his hand underneight the bed to look for the lil guy....  > Yeow!" Compton screams, "Fucker bit me!" as he sits back holding his tender mit.  Penny murmurs "Fucking monkey," on her way out.
