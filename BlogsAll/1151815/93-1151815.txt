         Mead Forest - Alti Lake          Verdant green gives way to brilliant skies of blue marked by the occasional puffy cloud that slowly floats across  the sea above. The forest has parted and the tall elms and oaks give way to smaller ash and the occasional shrub, the difference in height lending an appearance of homage paid. The creation to which such fealty and respect is paid is a simple lake that stretches off into the distance, but whose furtherest banks can still be glimpsed at the limits of one's sight.          The banks are marked by patches of nine o' tails and reeds that interrupt the lines of smooth earth worn so by  water and time. The croak of a frog and the cry of the birds above intermingle with the rough sounds of ducks and the buzzing of insects. Every so often, one catches sight of a shadow, small and undefined, sliding beneath the surface further from shore as well as the occasional glimpse of glittering silver scales. A sense of peace marks the scene, one that almost seems to make one desire to move on than stay and risk disturbing the tranquility of the lake's inhabitants.  Contents: Liv Polar-bear Jodie Kaze Matt Zoe Kasui Sylvan Obvious exits: North    Southwest    Polar-bear is looking at you.  Sylvan returns to Jodie's side, then ushers her and Kasui to follow her back home. She calls to Matt and the other, "I hope we meet again and share a good meal and stories."  Pobble trundles along, with a monkey sat on his shoulder. He seems mostly held up by his walking stick which isn't of the bought variety but of the 'picked up along the way to prevent falling over' kind. His expression is paradoxial, a conflict of hyperactivity and tiredness as if desparately wanting to lie down and sleep but being pulled along on some travel against his will.  Sylvan departs the well-worn paths of the lake area, disappearing into the thickets and brambles.  Sylvan has left.  Moving along an overgrown path, the Polar-bear ambles along at an easy gait. On his back, rides the lovely Liv. She grins widely, her fingers digging deeply down into the bear's thick fur and holding herself on.  Zoe nods to Sylvan as she leaves with the others, then turns when she hears the others, her face taking on an air of  disbelief. Do they never stop arriving to private property?? Yet, when the bear is spied, she smiles a touch, a hand  reaching out to touch Matt briefly to call attention, the dog at her feet growling before she gives another silent hand  command that hushes the beagle.  Jodie does proceed to follow Sylvan, giving her farewells to the others with a wave and a smile before turning to go  through the same opening in the brush Syl went through.  Matt quirks a brow, seeing the Polar bear and his rider. He looks at them curiously.  Polar-bear looks around at all the folks comming and going and staying. He wanders over to bump into Zoe. Not hard. Maybe a sort of polar bear version of 'Hey how are you?'. Then he stop. Hm. Pobble has his attention as the beast decides how he feels around one of these two legged things wearing so much white fur. And the monkey. It's ... bite sized. Yum.  Liv is looking at you.  Kasui pushes away from the tree as Sylvan urges her, apparently not having been so unalert after all. She says not a word as she follows Sylvan through the opening in the brush, merely giving Zoe and Matt a nod, thugh sh gives th epolar bear a sidelong glance before disappearing after her friend into the rushes...  Liv is just along for the ride. Her eyes get wide as she bear bumps into people.. and she ofers an appologetic smile as she says "Hi.. uhm.. excuse us..." THe woman speak with a noticable norse sort of accent.  Zoe cannot help but smile at the bear, though she glances to Matt first before hse reaches out to give the huge animal a friendly scritch. Yeah, she's petting a polar bear. STrange things you see sometimes here in the woods. Lifting her gaze to the woman that rides the bear, she smiles, nodding to her, "Good afternoon.. It is ok." At least she's not been licked yet by fish-baited drooly tongue. Turning, she leans in to whisper something to Matt at her side.  Pobble stops dead in his tracks. He sways uncertainly, struggling against gravity. Eyes dart between those assembled, and the bear. The monkey seems edgy, tiny hands grabbing onto one of Pobble's braids and it lets out a quiet chitter. The blue haired yeti nods slowly. "Eh. Sorry. I'm lost.. I was trying to get back to the picnic site?" His coat is pulled and torn, as are his pants. Leaves and bambles cling to the thick white fur. He does look in the 'lost and distraught' category.  Kaze is for his part still standing in the shadows at the edge of the treeline, seeming to slide easily from the mind's eye as he merely watches making no moves to call attention to himself.  Matt nods softly to something Zoe says to him.  Monkey ... so tastey ... The bear licks his lips and stares.  Liv notices where the bear is looking, and reaches out to bonk the white monster square between his ears with a fist!   "There'll be no eating of pets." she states firmly.  Kasui has disconnected.  The Monkey also seems to notice the attention it's getting and slinks down into it's clothing before clambering behind   Pobble's head and dropping down into the oversized hood. The blue haired man hops from one foot to the other, apparently cold. Eyes with oversized pupils dart from one wood-lover to the next. "Anyone able to direct me?"  Matt hmms. "I'm sorry, what're you looking for?'  Zoe muffles a laugh at Liv's words to the bear, then falls silent as she turns to look at Pobble, curious and watchful of  the strange one with the monkey on his back. Oiy, that just makes her want to start singing for some reason.  Could just gobble him right up. Or maybe just half. Save the rest for ... Hey! THe bear crains his neck to see the woman on his back. He does his best to look wounded. Deeply. On a moraly and philosophical level. Then he bolts for the water, taking his passanger with him.  Kaze steps out from where he has been the entire time, only now coming into general notice stepping over near Pobble and eyeing the bear with rider, "It is this way Pobble-san, come I will show you." Where did he come from anyway? He motions with one hand for Pobble to follow heading towards one of the paths.  Giving a startled cry, Liv is forced to hold on.. or be dumped in the dirt. She gives a cry of exclamation as she starts to  tug on ythe bear's shoulders saying "No! No! Not the water!"  Pobble is momentarily distracted by the ridden bear and looses track of his reply. Mouth flapping he finally finds some  words, sounding weary and a little agitated. "Picnic grounds? I parked somewhere near a picnic ground and have been wandering all night. I'm fuckin' tired now. I want to go home." The arrival of Kaze throws him further off guard and he gawps at the man as if to say 'What are you doing here?' Either way, he begins to walk towards him and his direction.  Yes, the water. The ground practicly shakes as the bear eats up the distance and ... SPLASH! He comes to the surface looking quite pleased with himself.  Falling off the bears back, Liv is soaked easily to the bone. Sputtering and spitting out water, she comes up to the  surface and splashes at the big white bear.  Matt chuckles a bit. "Water, it's wet."  Swimming to shore, Liv shakes herself off the best she can, and then moves towards the trails and back into the woods...   Seems she doesn't want to stick around all wet.  Pobble peers at the hoohaffle and shakes his head lightly, forcing himself to move onwards with the aid of his big stick.   The monkey still cowers mostly out of sight in the hood and he comes to a halt next to Kaze, leaning across to whisper. "Please.. get me out of here." He seems quite anxious at the situation unfolding about him.  Zoe watches as Pobble seems to go off with.. wait, where did Kaze come from? Talk about people coming out of the woodwork today! Blinking a few times, she turns back in time to see the bear hit the water, and Liv swim to shore and disappear. Giggling finally, she hides the smile, turning to look at Matt for a moment, brow raised in silent question to him before turning back.  Polar-bear lumbers out of the water and shakes off, creating a brief rain storm. You can almost see him laughing. That is under the sandwhich, er monkey catches his eye again.  Matt nods to Zoe, and moves to greet teh bear and his companion. "Heya. I'm Matt - Zoe says you're a friend of hers."  Kaze nods to Pobble and leads him up the path to the North and away.  Kaze makes his way north.  Kaze has left.  You make your way north.
