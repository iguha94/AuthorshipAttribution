         Downtown - Parliament and Front E(#164RJM)       The downtown core can be seen in the horizon to the west. Here lie many of Toronto's old and abandoned warehouses. Fences set ten feet high with barbed wires interlacing the top portion guards this area closely. Despite the look of these dilapidated warehouses, this is a popular filming area for major motion pictures. The abandoned warehouses make a perfect location for many scenarios used in action movies and TV shows. Overhead, to the west lies the Gardiner Expressway where it joins with the major north-south highway, the Don Valley Parkway. To the west is the St. Lawrence Market and Union Station, while to the south is the docks to Lake Ontario.  Obvious exits:  Hana arrives from the north. Hana has arrived.  //.etro: Auto-aliasing to +today.

Sunrise:    7:29     Sunset:  16:30 Moonrise:  09:41     Moonset: 22:42 It is week 3 of the month and the first quarter moon is not up. The tide is low and ebbing. Sleet and freezing rain fall from heavy clouds, coating everything with ice and making the ground slippery. The world looks silver in the icy grey light. A raw wind blows from the northeast. ______________________________________________________________________________ Hana walks down the street, not minding the rain much, or the fact that her hair is turning to ice.  Compton, oddly enough is just standing there in the freezing rain. The Fur lined hood of his parka drawn up over his head. He stands staring at an old industrial complex, his fingers intertwined with the rusted chain-linked fence. With the anfgle of the hood and the loud pattering of the thick rain off of it it is doubtful he realizes anyone is around.  Maybe Hana recognizes the figure, if not the face. She slows, a dismal dripping half-frozen drowned cat. Stopping behind him, she looks past him at the industrial complex assuming you mean the light industrial shop?.  Okay, yes the Light Industrial Shop then. He just keeps standing there as if frozen stiff gazing at the structure, or perhaps sleeping on his feet with the deep rythmic breathing Compton seems to be performing.  //.etro: Compton rolls "perception+awareness" at diff 6          For a total of 0 success(es).  And just keeps on staring, oblivious. Hana dips her head and rubs her neck, running rivers of water from her hair into her eyes. Then, quietly, she steps up to the fence, beside Compton.  From the side profile, you can pick up on two things: 1. It is in fact the old perv from the bar and 2. he's wearing some weird-assed three lensed pair of goggles over his face that emit an eerie green light. Which is why he most likely isn't picking up on too much right now...  //.etro: Compton rolls "perception+awareness" at diff 6          For a botch!  Hana finds his seeming obliviousness slightly amusing-- but that's only amusing enough to make her lips twist into what is, at best, a sort of sad, ironical smile. She's barely managing her normally pacific expression today. But enough about what Compton doesn't even see. The rain probably muffles the faint swish of her sopping coat. She waits a few moments more.  A large city works truck comes rumbling up the street. The pinwheels under it spinning fast and throwing a copious amount of road salt on the road and up over the sidewalk. A loud chiming is created by the hard pellets bouncing off the chainlinks. It isn't moving fast though and most people can move out of the way and avoid it. Not ole Compton though. Stuck transfixed as he is on the spot.  (SPLAT!) (CRUNCH!)  Compton is thrown up against the fence violently when he gets his in the back of the head with a particularly large chunk of road salt. The Springboard action of the chainlinks then propell him backwards and down to the now gritty pavement. (It also just happens that due to the angle and position of Compton, Hana is completely protected by the passing truck.)  "Ow. Fuck!" is the frank observation from the big guy. His goggles askew and a fresh cut on his forhead starts to seep blood.  From his position on the ground, he can observe Hana at a bizarre angle. She looks down at him from a seemingly great height, one of her hands still on the fence as she looks over her shoulder. The same little wan smile touches her lips. Watching the rain wash the blood down his face, Hana sayds, after a moment, "Are you hurt?" Ya think?  Compton struggles a little bit to even make it to his elbows, "Wha?" is his second response and he pulls his goggles down around his neck and dazzedly squints at Hana, "Who...?" is his third comment and finally reaching to his forehead with two fingers and touches the wound, "Ow. Fuck." again. Guess that's an affirmative.  "You're going to need a bandaid," Hana says, with possibly irritating frank observation. "I don't have any." She turns fully from the fence and steps forward, offering the man a hand. To look at the two, it's amusing to think she could pull him up. More likely she'll end up flat on her face.  "Ss'sallright." Compton manages sounding stupifed. Rolling to one side on the slippery sidewalk and gets to his knees, which complain loudly at the abuse. Standing now, he's soaked through, the parka not much good when lying on yer back in 1/4" of slush. He pulls off the stupid looking Santa's cap he was wearing under the hood and uses it as a make shift bandage.   Now that he's more together he gives a side long glance at Hana again. Reapprasing her from his 6ft stance. "Ow. Fuck." to the wound, and then, "Wh-why'd ya hit me for?" he asks testily. "If I had hit you, you wouldn't be in a position to ask me why," she says, rather sombrely. She turns and walks back to the fence, placing her hands on the top again. "What's so fascinating about the shop?" she asks, obviously meaning the building at which you were formerly staring.  Compton looks unconvinced at the first statement but pulls the cap away and prods at his forehead again. The bleedings stopped, which ain't too bad for a guy his age. Tossing the hat away in to the street he pulls his hood back up and covers his quickly freezing head, "Lookin for someone. Got a hunch 'bout this place. It shit though." Of cource, said guy could have been standing next to him and Compton would have missed it this morning. He looks tired. His face is drawn, moreso than the last time you saw him. Dark rings under his bloodshot eyes speak to a long night of staring at random buildings.  "Really? I've lived there," she says, leaning against the fence. "By the way, you owe me money." She rubs the back of her neck again. She's soaked pretty much to the bone, as if she's been soaking in cold water for a long time. The way someone looks when drenched in hours of rain is somehow more pathetic than if they've been dunked in a lake.  Compton grimaces at the fact he's been staring at your home for the last hour in vain, "Yeah well... ain't the right place." he says defensivley. The cold and the wet and now the gouge in his forehead make Compton look even more haggard than before, taking it beyond pathetic to tragically sad. At least without the hat now he looks less homeless. "What?" he asks incrediously, "Fuck you I do." his his not so friendly reply to the joke.  only it's not a joke. Funny thing, a little girl asking an older, much larger man for the money he owes her. "Well, no, there was no fucking, but I did what I could. I can't help it if he vomitted." She glances towards the house again. "Maybe that is the right place, hm?"  "No, it's not and no I don't." Compton says incresingly agitated, "I remember that night pretty good, and you stated some fucked up dollar amount then attacked the kid. Never said I'd pay... If anything I owe you a favour. That's it." and undoes the strap holding his goggles in place around his neck and stuffs them in one of the pockets of his coat.  Hana lifts a hand and smooths back her wet hair, flinging drops of water behind her, invisible in the rain. "Come on, you're not going to make me -insist-, are you? I mean, after I put you on your back again, I'll have to go get Alex and explain to him he's got his house staked out. I really don't like him right now, not on good terms since he thinks I tried to kill him. It'll just be a big bother."  Maybe it's the fact that he's a sexist, ageist pig and doesn't feel threatened standing before a soggy china doll, or maybe it is just the fact that hanging out with outcasts has just inured him to threats period. "Yeah, okay. Whatever little girl. Ya ain't getting a dollar from me, so go fuck off." is his increasingly less eloquent reply. The guys had a bad start to a day he is most likely willing to go forget in a bottle of rye.  Compton also looks like he about to go on his way.  Hana stands still and silent.  Hana seems to be letting you go on your way, watching as, or until, you turn your back on her.  Compton promptly turns his back on Hana and goes to walk across the street.  //.etro: Hana rolls "dexterity+brawl" at diff 6          For a total of 5 success(es).  Perhaps you don't even realize what's happened until you hit the ground; perhaps the shock of hitting the ground keeps you from realizing it, even then. Something certainly happened, though, and there, above you, you can see Hana looking down. "Very sorry, but I need the money. I am tired of sleeping in trees."  Penny arrives from the west. Penny has arrived.  Compton rolls over furious. There's murder in his eyes, "What the fuck cunt?!" he exclaims, perhaps not as affective a statement lying in the frozen street as it could have been. "Yer fucked now." Again, intimidating, not so much.  Compton is lying in the street now, yelling at the tiny girl. Calling her very nasty things and he too is soaked through with a fresh gouge in his forehead. Some sort of papers in hand, Penny gets out of a cab at the corner of Parliament and Front streets bidding the cabbie a cheerful thanks-and-goodbye as she opens up a huge umbrella. There's an incredibly strange air about the woman - happy as a pig in shit.  Singin'in the rain.  Penny splashes about down the street for half a block with some destination in mind before she catches on to the commotion over yonder.  "Oi! Old man?"  //.etro: Hana rolls "dexterity + athletics" at diff 6          For a total of 1 success(es).  Hana stretches, putting her hand behind her neck, and her other hand behind her back, betwen her coat and t-shirt. "No, trust me, fucking would be a lot more expensive. Look, you said you were weqalthy enough. i think "loaded" was the word? So why being so stingy? Come on gaijin, get off your ass and pay up. And maybe while we're at it, you wannt tell me why you're spying on that place over there, hm?" Hana leans over, and pulls off the odd pair of goggles Compton's wearing. Not too easy, getting them from around his neck.  "Ain't got no million bucks to spend on a do nuthin whore, especially one that I didn't agree to pay." Compton says pushing himself off the ground, sheets of slush falling form his back.  Closer now, Penny yells "OI," through the sleet and rain "OLD MAN?" like she's confused. That couldn't be what or who she thinks it is. It's too early - there isn't even a lunch crowd loitering. She half-circles to get a better look and ..stops.  "Two things wrong with that," Hana says. "One, I'm not a whore, which I told you, and two, you did say you would pay me anyway. Now, usually I'm damned easy-going, but I've been having a pissy lifetime, and almost getting vomitted on by a highflying chingaku doesn't help." Hana steps back a few feet, putting the goggles around her neck with her own pair. "I suppose we can do this later, though. I guess I owe it to Alex to tell him he's being watched."  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" at diff 5          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Everybody feels abnormally calm. Everything's coming up motherfucking roses. That bad day you were having? Gone. It's like you just won the goddamn lottery.  Compton flinches at Penny hollaring and looks like he's about to fly in to another torrent of explatives at the lil nipper. But instead smiles real big and dopey like and says "Hi Penny." all chipper like.  No noticable change in Hana. In fact, she seemed pretty calm already. Weird enough. Oh, but wait, she does seem less sombre...  Compton sloshes up the street all sodden from lying in it. Grinning like a fucking idiot.  Hana watches Compton's dramatic change. Not feeling dramatically different herself,, she does, however, decide to let the matter drop. besides, she's got his goggles. Maybe that will do for payment. She starts heading north, herself.  And Penny, taking Compton by the elbow, moves between the mounds of snow and crap back to the sidewalk. Penny is not smiling. Penny doesn't seem to be affected by this calming sensation, says loud enough to be overheard by any passer-by "Y'like it when little girls pound on you, hey old man?" and she turns an unflinching eye over her shoulder to Hana "Those're booby-trapped, chiquita" and keeps walking with Compton under her umbrella. She hails a cab and ushers him in.  ~FIN~
