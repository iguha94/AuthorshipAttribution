         Downtown - Jarvis and Dundas(#131RJ)       Empty lots and undeveloped plots of useless land fill this intersection. Old, largely-abandoned factories are set up along the streetside. Development here ceased long ago, apparently. Two major homeless shelters operate in this area, given its rather cheap real-estate value. The area is mostly populated by homeless people, junkies and whores, though the occasional employee of the few operating companies in this area might be seen driving through... generally rapidly.  Contents: Jesse Chase Billboard In Front of the Vacant Lot   Almost sunrise, some people don't sleep. Like the never ending patrol across the street in front of the private lot. Or, snug between two smaller imports, a black Mustang is nestled in a space barely big enough to hold it's frame. The windows tinted, the doors closed, the only hint someone's in there is the smell of smoke in passing. Though you'd hafta be near the worn vehicle to pick that up. And even closer to finger it as weed.   With the vague shuffle of a junkie or the ponderous attention to balance of a drunk, Jesse turns the corner and drifts up the quiet pavement. He is hunched, his right hand held before his eyes, and whatever is in it, he's following it, his slow and careful steps winding around manholes, pausing at crumpled newspapers, and veering towards the detritus in the gutters. Then, motionless - he stops and looks up, turns one way, then the other, then stares at the dark car before him. Alone, as it were, on the morning sidewalk, accompanied only by everyman's partner Jimmy Beam, visible when the left hand brings the fifth from under his coat for a surreptitious sip.  If she had eyes, she'd look back up. But it so happens the Mustang's lights are off, and the engine's long cold. Still, there's stirring inside, and a squeak which can be attributed to the window roller. Down the tinted glass slides, allowing a narcotic fog bank to drift into the pre-dawn air. "Oi." From dark inside, a figure's illuminated by a strange blue glow. One usually associated with Pilipino kids who trick out their Acuras with neon and play streetfighter at the local liquor store. "That whiskey?"   A nod, and Jesse looks at the ersatz pendulum in his right hand - a glass eye in a knotted condom - and shakes it. Flaccid. He looks at the car again, shrugs, and tosses the rubber into a storm drain. He offers the bottle to the window.  "Bourbon. Cheers."  It's a trade then. Chase's callused hand offers up a mostly smoked blunt through the opening, before he leans back into the relative cover to swig. Lip smacking sounds, he even wipes the bottle. "Tits." He approves and sticks his head out proper to be identified as such. Lazy eyes follow the makeshift wondrous item, then back up to Jesse. Though his square chin is sure to recoil into the depths of his ride when the first dawn of the new year threatens to rise over some buildings. "Inside?" A suggestion, and look back across to the vacant lot.   A_Raven flies high above the city streets, heading north.  Jesse nods, cupping the last of the blunt to his lips to guard the red glow from whoever might be watching. He skirts around the car, swings the passenger door open, and stares at the sky in disbelief.  "Fuck me." He coughs out smoke. "That's a big fucking pigeon."  With that, he folds himself into the car and slams the door shut.  A_Raven caws as it flies over.  Again with the squeaks, they belong to the car's window handle. The black Mustang sports equally dark glass to conceal her contents. And their number is two now.   Inside the car, Chase allows Jesse in and hands him back the bottle. Tit for tat, and the blunt's plucked back. The thick man's gaze too focused on the lot to notice the creatures native to this hood. "Missed 'r. What the shit's new, amigo?" It's asked without looking, Chase turns back to watch the patrol as the hotbox continues. The blue glow, now obviously emanating from a stacked stereo system and digital nitrate regulator.   "Fuck all." Jesse shrugs amicably, accepting the bottle once more. "Ta." He turns his gaze across the street, as though by staring he might unlock the secrets of the construction yard. "Been away, came back, far as I can tell everyone's still dumb, we're still in a hotel room, and now apparently dumb has been going to meetings, 'cause we're supposed to be organized."   Stinkface. "I've 'ad it with that lot." Chase seems cocksure, "Fuckin' central." Here he vents, and turns back to Jesse. The blunt idly smokes by it's self. "They want me ta help 'm watch their gay ass altered states." Pffffts. A big hit and raspy voice as he speaks in the safety of his aged Mustang. "Like I'm a babysitter 'r some shite, ahhh chingato."   Jesse shrugs. "We gave 'em Peachy to keep them quiet. He just churns out press realeases an' says shit with that smile of his, so the rest of us can do, uh..." He laughs. "Whatever it is we do. Had some logistical problems with the rest of our stuff arriving. Weren't planning to stay in the Holiday Inn all year."  "Yeah well. General Paris... He says do, 'n I do." There's more smoking, Chase checks the lot every 8 seconds. "Least you cabrones gotta face man. 'I walk in there and take their shite meself. Hell, gimme fuckin' Timor anyday. I'll take a sea a' gooks 'n bungy traps."  "Ask me, you should break out the black mask and pipe, man." Jesse tilts his hat forwards, leaning back in his seat with a grin. "Pull some of that old ELZN magic. Really shake shit up."   "'S not 'red' in this city yet. There's time for prep work." Chase sniffles, ashing the blunt and nudging Jesse with it as it's near dead. "I go into grease paint and go mode, there's no turnin' back. 'N I got shite ta do still."   Jesse nods, holding the blunt with his fingernails, a scant half-inch from his pursed lips as he inhales. "Way I see it," he pauses to blow smoke at the windshield. "Way I see it, we're working backwards. Stopping construction's not gonna do anything. Fucking with them isn't the same as getting anything done. People around here, I don't really see them doing anything. Aside from the martyr me jesus kids, and I try not to think about what they're doing too much."   "Japutos." Chase curses, rubbing his nose absently. With a long exhale he settles back into the fake lamb furred seat. Still eyeing the lot from a lazy slump. "Ya know, if i had the resources, shit would be churnin' in this fucker already. I woulda had hot fuckin' blow on the streets. I'm talkin' day-stopping shit, opening people up right on the damn sidewalk to spiritual convulsions. 'Stead? Instead I get to guard the 5th dimension from ghosts... Paris better make his mind up soon, I can't take this anymore."    Jesse laughs and offers the last shreds of blunt back, then takes a pull of the bourbon. "Hell. I don't even know who Paris is. Peaches takes care of all that, I just gotta keep my mouth shut and quit screaming at the Criamon chick." He shakes his head no. "Hate to say this, but if anything goes down, I trust the people at my back, you know? Those joeboos in the backyard, I wouldn't trust them to know which end of the gun to point, let alone not to hit me on accident."   "Paris is my man back in Guam. He's tactical coordinator of the 12th signal brigade, After-Math central." Chase looks down to the dead brown scrap that was the blunt and gnashes it into his ashtray. "He's the only one I trust with me life in this damn shitglobe. All them other cabrones, well, i'm just here 'cause el General says so. Till he figures out strategical advantage in Toronto theatre, i'm supposed ta play nice and forget that they relocated me Chile." A red eyed glance at the blue display, and the sun rising tell him it's time. "But all that, that's another story. Time ta beat rocks, hombre." A hand's offered over, callused and worn. "Via con dios."  Jesse nods, opening the door, and tucking the bottle between the seats. "Watch your six, caballero." He grins and tugs the brim of his hat, then slides out of the car and slams the door shut, stretching and yawning widely. "'sup, Penn?" Jesse calls over. "You headin' back holidayside?"  *Vroom and Rumble* Off the car goes. Go eat Chase, go eat. Chase escapes OOC. Chase has left.  There's a long dark car rolling through this part of town. Maybe one of those pharmaceuticals had a til-dawn party. Day-running lights? or just lights still on could place that car in a variety of situations. But it stops up on the corner and Penny gets out.  Doubletake. Penny?  Or an evil twin; dark hair, dark man's coat pulled out behind her. The door clicks shut behind her, a heavy and well-machined sound. A wealthy of oil and engineering. Such a simple thing. And as she moves out between garbage cans and piles of recyclables, the car rolls after her, shadowing. The window goes down and a gloved hand extends a card stacked on a characteristic fold of money.  "Penny?" He repeats himself. "You heading hoidayside or what?  Abel appears from the north. Abel has arrived. Abel comes walking down the street, hands dug deep into his pockets to keep warm.  The hand from the car does not waver or shake the offering but does seem strained. It is not a long or especially deft arm. Positioning tells us this person is riding shotgun, backwards. That it's low on the edge of the window suggests 'asian.' Maybe it's the cut of the glove. Penny takes the two steps back to the glove, takes the cash and card. The car peels out as she pockets the fold into a jacket clearly not hers.  "You're back." Stunned, Penny has to squint out of the sun just to get a better look. Like the hat and profile isn't enough to convince her what she's seeing is real. "I need a drink. Don't think that hotel bar's still open."  Abel          You see a good-looking young man in his late teens, maybe 19 or 20. He stands about 5'10". His one time straight, California-blonde hair has been cut and faded to a more normal blonde color and has curled a little now that it is a natural color again. His eyes are grey and have an old, far-away, feel to them, as if he's seen much more than any teen his age should or could have. He has a winning, trust-inspiring smile that frequently eases through his features and a lot of natural presence and charisma. He speaks with a California accent, almost the stereotypical surfer type, unless he's in a formal situation when he obviously tries to control it. He's on the skinny side and doesn't look very strong but is lean and moves easily on sure feet.            Currently he is wearing a pair of clean khacki cargo pants and a black long sleeve T-shirt. Over the black he is wearing a grey, short-sleeve T-shirt with a picture of a penny on the back of it. He wears brown, mid-cut hiking shoes. Around his neck, on a thin chain, hangs a small, stylized sun symbol.            Over all this he is wearing a warm-looking brown great-coat to ward against the Toronto winter cold.  Jesse points to the retreating car. "Left the bourbon with Chase." He shrugs, scratching at his sleeve. "Tats are still fresh. Itch like fuck. 'mgonna pass out. Wake me before new years, hey?"  //.etro: It is 08:45 am, mid-morning, on Wednesday the 31. day of December, 2008.   Abel stops in front of the Hyperion lot, looking at it with a bit of a frown.  You say, "Is that who.." Maybe it's the shoes, but she wobbles and puts her hand on Jesse's arm suddenly, catches herself. "Don't let him touch you with it," a not-whisper. "Don't go in the bathroom. He keeps it there."  Clearly Penny isn't going back to the hotel any time soon.  Jesse nods. "D'worry. Been pissing in Piggy's wheaties anyway." Jesse bares another yawn, tugs his coat closed, and shuffles towards the hotel once more. "Don't forget, kick me before the new year or else."  Abel turns from the lot to look across the Street at Mecca. He frowns at it as well. If he noticed the car episode or not is open to speculation. In this neighborhood deals going down out of cars are hardly out of the ordinary.  Jesse moves pretty fast for .. well for him. He's gone off the block and caught a cab back across town. Penny would do something similar except for her heels. They make the walking slow going, painful to watch her stick in the pavement cracks, narrowly missing sidewalk grates, shaking the odd piece of garbage from underfoot.  Abel read your description.  Penny(#6870PIOAC)           The refined sythesis of hard living and regular controlled substance abuse is as much a draw as it is obvious. The countenance is the portrait of the soul and the eyes mark its intentions. What is most clear is that Penny wants. Green eyes, sun-scorched dyed-black eyebrows obvious on the paler skin. Her mouth a red, ripe stain; a suggestion of violence.  Somewhere it was ordained that she have a sleekly dark skull, that she have this black hair; full on top and pared down at the sides. Buzzed into a V-shape at the nape. Slopes and curves festoon upward from both ears, shaved into the scalp like a tagger's signature, fine print. About half the hair on top has been threaded by silver wire and glass straws.  That dress is criminal; steals glances, fosters ungovernable thoughts - some more potent than others. A swathe of gunmetal silk, it drapes from shoulder to shoulder just across the neck and down to points just past the knee. Its back also mantled low into the small of the back is cut to focus on a tiny silver chain-and-pendulum and a design. Running up Penny's spine is a tattoo of shapes similar to those shaved into her hair. Same artist. Impossible heels finish the look, ankles in the bondage of iAbel nods to Penny if she comes near him, but out of politeness more than any thing else. He seems to be lost in his thoughts and his eyes havea slightly distant, unfocused look to them.  In this part of town, distant and disconnected are modus operandi. See there? No one's bothered to roust the homeless out of those corners, not even the light of day can stir them to wakeful and alert. It's this fog, this bone-chilling fog. It settles like a skein, crisscrossing awareness until things, people, are bumped into. Walking like this, half-senseless, Penny knocks into Abel's mirage.  Abel seems to anticipate Penny knocking into him and moves to catch her before she falls or snaps her ankles in those shoes she's wearing. His eyes refocus. "Are you alright Miss?" The coat falls open, red stains inside. Some bright, some brick. Another dress bundled inside it starts to slither out. She's fast, recoiling the pieces to her "I'm" weary, cold "sorry. I'm f-fu-fine" she chatters "It's these shoes." It isn't funny but she laughs in a way that makes you think it really is her shoes that're the problem.  Abel nods and looks down at the shoes. "How can you walk in those things at all? Like, This isn't a good neighborhood to not be able to move quickly in." His california accent is pretty noticeable right now. "And you sound cold."  "Friends," she nods at some vanishing point up the street. Whoever they were, they're gone now. Steadied and righted at your side, Penny touches on a moment of clarity "And you're here. You're here," indicating the lot's fence without pointing, but a nod of her head. Like that says everything.  Abel smiles a little. The chain around his neck and the symbol on it catching the light momentarily. "Friends? I Know Jesse a little. But I don't think we've met." He gestures to the lot with his head as well. "As far as 'here' goes, I'm working on the problem."  If it were any more obvious, it would've bit her. Penny goes 'ah' and collects herself on less unsteady ground. "What binds m.. " she starts but with a wince, her head canting to the side internalizing the rest of that phrase, bites it down the way drunks hold back the naseau "Penny. I'm Penny," left hand crossed to cover that stitch in her side, the coat concealing a better portion of the gesture. "Y'know Jes. That's good, look," with a renewed urgency "could you just hail me a cab maybe? I'm not.." not so good is what she means.  Abel nods. "Nice to meet you Penny. I'm Abel. And yeah. I can get you a cab." He looks up and down the street, making sure Penny doesn't fall over. "It takes an act of God to get one in this part of town to stop though." He grins a little. He says a small prayer under his breath as he looks up and down the street, then gestures at a cab passing through in a hurry. That it stops may be nothing short of Miraculous. It actually goes by, then seems to have a change of heart and turns around and comes back to the couple.  Hiro arrives from the south. Hiro has arrived.  New Years Eve. Nobody gives a second thought to another person just a little too full of festive cheer. It isn't anywhere near midnight. Nobody is supposed to have uncorked the champagne yet. Hiro must be a cracked-out loon. But there's plenty of those to go around, around these parts. Cracked out loons.                  "PEEEENNNAAAH!"  And, with that, Hiro appears from nowhere. And collides with Penny.  He appears to be attempting to grapple her in some kind of terrible bone-cracking bearhug.  The cab, naturally. That's where Hiro came from. That's why it backed up and got so close to Penny and Abel. Providence.  And Penny, in those heels.  The hapless mass that is Hiro is not something she shies away from but that look on her face, that mask of a halfsmile. That charicature of horrified and forgetful glee straps itself across her entire body in a posture of absolute agony when he gets a hold of her.  And she screams.  "PiggypiggypiggyNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO..god..god..god..god..oh..god."  Abel frowns and winces. "Carefull Hiro, She's hurt." He reaches around to make sure the three of them don't go over onto the ground.  Hiro read your description. Hiro Bad posture is to blame for Hiro's diminutive presence: with shoulders slumped and hands balled up in his pockets, he cruises closer to 5'6 than his modest 5'9. The polite might refer to him as 'big boned' or 'chubby': the fact remains, however, that he simply looks like a pig. Short, tousled black hair, a plain face that edges towards the porcine, and silent, placid brown eyes distorted to largeness by corrective lenses. His double-helix bears the tags of half a dozen southeast asian cultures, with a smattering of anglo-mutt thrown in on this side of the pacific.  In 1993, Rancid's release tour for their self-titled debut was met with a small riot in Des Moines, Iowa. The Wallgreens off of I-26 -- being the only business open at two in the morning -- was attacked by teenaged punk rockers. The pharmacy, in particular, suffered heavy damage and losses: an estimated street value of seven thousand dollars in valium, muscle relaxants, and ritalin. The on-duty pharmacist had his labcoat stripped from his shoulders during the struggle, whereupon it was appropriated by a Mod who went on to become a speed cook. The garment hanging from Hiro's shoulders, sleeves rolled back to half-conceal the chemical burns scorching the fabric, shows it's history. The blank white pin affixed at his collar, however, tells no stories.  A white t-shirt bears a black and red steer's head: ']D[' embossed in fixedsys font. Black cargo pants faded to grey collect around the tops of dingy white sneakers, many-zippered pockets cross-hatching the thighs.  "Ohmygoshsorryareyouhurt?" Hiro releases Penny immediately, then -- near-immediately, or perhaps most immediately post-immediately -- hugs her again, then releases her again, seems to get caught in some kind of dull feedback loop. Stops. Physically stutters. Blinks owlishly. His eyes have the look of a solar eclipse. "Sorry. Hi, Abel. What the fuck is going on?" Big, hesitant kid's smile.  Penny keeps Hiro close, her fingers sinking deep into arm-tissue, keeps him from breaking her in half. She asides to him, mouth more or less occluded by the bulging rim of his glasses, "It's Pobs, did a thing and" Hiro can feel whatever kind of gesture she makes. Something that signifies this thing can not be helped or sorted. "We uh.. " indicating Abel "just met." And to put a point on it, a wad of cash and business card tumbles out of the disarray of other-dress and gathered coat in Penny's arms.  Seeing that Penny is latched on to Hiro, and knowing theyu aren't going to topple any Time soon, Abel stoops down to scoop up the cash and card. He doesn't look at... it's not his business. "You should probably get her to a doctor. I'd help if I could, but, Like, I'm not good with that kind of stuff." He pauses a moment. "I bet Jane Connelly could help her."  "Oh," mubles Hiro. He frowns just faintly, squints at Abel, and runs a hand down Penny's side. Perhaps he's feeling up her ribcage. Mrowr. Cognition flickers somewhere in saucerlike eyes, a spark somewhere beneath the placid surface. "Who's the dirty roman?" he asks. Then: "N'thanks. Conelly doesn't like us much."  Penny insists, if a bit belatedly "I'm not /hurt/." Whatever it is Penny considers herself, it's not one of the walking wounded. If you can ignore her eyeballs rolling to whites when Hiro does that thing with his hand, Penny might be covincing. "Nnn...noli me tangere," the words resurected in the harshest whisper.  Snaps. Clicks back into place. She nudges Hiro and thrusts her chin at the cash "Pocket that," snapped from whatever trance that was "doneednoquack," gritting through her teeth.  Abel hands the wad of Cash to Hiro. "Yeah... I know you guys don't." He says very little on the subject. Not that he looks like he doesn't have an opinion about the matter, but that he thinks it best to keep it to himself.  A dumb stare at the wad of money; Hiro stands there, in the middle of el ghetto, gawking like an idiot. The business card is eyeballed like some incredibly complex, intense puzzle. "Mmmyeah," he counters, dumbly. The taxi is just idling there, running up a bill -- Pig-boy looks back over his shoulder. The wad gets stuffed, haphazardly, into a pocket of his labcoat. "Talkatchoo later, honest abe. Me'n Pen need to get back to bible study." A stupid grin, as if this was some incredibly clever in-joke shared by all present. It isn't.  It is. But it isn't. "Nice ta" and Penny shows an absent twiddle of fingers. witched to autopilot, she lets Hiro take over. He moves her in a way that suggests this is practiced. Learned. Habitual. There's order here; jacket and dress balled up and thrown into the backseat then he takes both her hands. Wrapping them close to her body, he positions her backwards into the cracked pleather and lifts her wholly into the cradle of the rear bench beneath the knee.  The little perv.  Her head tips back and to the side, lolls before Hiro slams the door shut. Her forehead presses to the glass, fog of bodyheat rising in a halo around her head.  Abel nods. "Peace be With the both of you, and Providence guide your steps. And call me sometime Hiro... or come by St. Matt's. Like, we haven't talked in ages and I always enjoyed the ones we had." He pats a lump in one of his pockets. "Aaron's got me to go cellular now so I'm moch more reachable."  If you can't keep it in your pants, keep it in the cabal. There's some kind of argument with the driver, and the cab peels out.
