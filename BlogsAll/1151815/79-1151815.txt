         (Cash starts in his effort to infiltrate the local drug competition.)  Another foggy and shitty day here in lovely Erin's Vale. A blanket of obfuscation for the seedier elements of the world to hide under. If it was ever sunny, the dealers and pimps might scatter like roaches when the lights go on. But, the lights are off. And the roaches are deeply entrenched in their hidey holes and comfortable corners of opportunity.   Enter Cash. White, disheveled, and out of place in this neighborhood. 'S a miracle he's made it this far, really. Brothers watch the semi retired video editor shamble through the concrete jungle, probably another junkie looking for the next high. His sneakers carry him towards a few gangstas patrolling the front of a liquor store. Looking for marks, johns, or victims. Cash could be any of the above. Whiskey aura just detectible, he approaches said gangsta.   "Hey, man."   Amidst the fog and human detritus that lie across broken concrete and beneath black shadows of ancient sins, the white man draws interest and hunger. Yet, there is no action taken. Those hungry eyes merely widen as the man walks without seeming care or knowledge of the dangers held within this dying land. They withdraw to hidden alleys and soft curses as the fool walks towards the lords of this realm, daring to tread where even seraphim fear to look.          The words uttered receive a look of surprise, wide eyes and dropped jaws, from those men to whom the foolish white boy speaks. There is a pause as the comical expressions refuse to leave their features before a bout of laughter wracks the group. The laughter dies soon enough as one of the crew takes a swaggering step closer to this fool as a hand slides beneath loose clothes to grasp the unseen.  "What up, holmes? Bit far from home?"  "Yeah. Totally." The slurred response of the inebriated. The picture gets clearer; this must be a bum who's lost his place in the soup line. Homeboy can smell alcohol leaking from Cash's pours. He sweats the stuff. There's even a personalized bottle tucked under layers of denim which looks just as worn as the man himself.   "Ya know, I don' even know where I am, ta tell the truth, man. Like, where cin cracker like myself score 'round here." The jean scarecrow looks about, ensuring the relative safety of their interaction. It's not safe, for him. But at least there's no pigs patrolling. That could be a good thing, or a very very bad thing. Ether way, he continues to play the part of the searching white junkie.  "Ya wanna' score?" The chorus of jeering laughter rises from behind the delegated representative of the lounging gang at the question asked. The laughter is acknowledged with a quick smile and look over shoulder. Then, with that smile firmly in place, another step is taken as the young man reaches out to lay his other hand reassuringly upon the junkie's shoulder. "Right place, wrong time, amigo."  There's a quick look about the street before attention settles once more upon the drunk with a smile grown wider by several degrees as an additional question is broached. "Got some money, amigo? 'cause if ya do, we might have the hook-up. Just gotta have the cash is all." There's another glance back towards the lounging men behind as another chorus of coarse laughter rises.  "Mmmm. Yeah. Dinero. Well... here's the thing..." Cash reaches into the greasy depths of his jacket pocket, withdrawing a handful of Pobble's primo cooked surprise crack rocks. It's held in his weathered and callused palm, jiggled within as his heavy eyelids are propped at half mass.   "I got these rocks here. 'N I don' really dig the stuff, ta tell ya the truth. I want some weed, but 'm willin' ta fork over like... two sixty bags of this shit for a good eighth of green. Or a lil' tar... Here..." Cash palms the off-white rocks over in a conspiratorial fashion. "Check that.. see if ya like it. If you gotta a rig, I'll smoke with ya. Ya know, jus' so you feel alright 'bout me, man."   Standard police narcotic procedure forbids partaking in controlled substances; this is an offer to show the homeboy he's not a cop. Might be a victim, but he's not a cop.  The laughter dies suddenly at the mention of a lack of green. Narrowed eyes and absent smiles greet the prouncement. Yet, the dark expressions lighten once more as huge grins spread across coarse features. The young gansta who stands before the would-be junkie blinks and then drops his hand from the junkie's shoulder to the white rocks glittering upon the proffered palm. One rock is deftly plucked from the offering and lifted to eye level. A moment's inspection returns a slight shrug as askance is looked at the crew steps behind.  "Try it!" The words are harsh as greedy eyes widen and their utterance prompts the gansta to pocket the rock before the hand rests upon the shoulder of the junkie once more. Pressure is delivered firmly as he takes a step towards a nearby alley. "Come on, amigo. There's a pipe back there. We can smoke a few and talk."  He'll find a willing subject, and Cash will accompany the gangster without abandon. A funeral march of sorts. Dead man walking. But this is Cash's game. And if there's a coffin in that alley, it doesn't belong to the wandering Jew.    "Far out." Words escapes Cash's chapped lips, and two fingers reach up behind his left ear. They're placed in a precise spot, a practiced movement he's intimate with. It's stimulates the Ki source lying dormant beneath tendons and muscle. Pressure's applied, and he adds a swig of whiskey from the bottle hiding under his denim flap. Lips smack at the sensation, and he wipes a small river of alcohol that threatens to run down his chin.    The pressure point spreads throughout his body warmly. Coupled with the rush of fire water, and an unseen hand gesture, his organs and vital points align themselves in a configuration least likely to suffer injury from a surprise attack. He prepares his mind and body for a deal gone wrong, though there are no signs of such an event.... yet.  WEATHER REPORT: The snow changes to a cold rain. The guiding hand draws the junkie towards the alleyway as another look is shot towards the now-snickering crowd. That hand, the one kept beneath clothes slips free finally with its contents hidden from the junkie by the gansta's body. The snickering grows louder as the young gansta starts talking with a jovial air, "Very, amigo. You gringos are nuts. Ya got rocks to match the huevos swinging between yo legs. Ya got style. Shame man." The final word ends with the hand slipping from shoulder to center of the junkie's back.  There's a sharp pressure and the junkie receives a sharp shove as the gansta swings his other hand up in front of his body. The hand's contents revealed now, black steel glinting with dangerous promise. The gansta laughs and spits out, "Real shame. Bueno dias, senor."  Not that this wasn't to be expected, but perhaps Cash had thought this part would come latter on in the game. Bearing gifts of crack cocaine doesn't usually get one shot, but this is the path this unlucky gangsta has chosen.   At the edge of the cliff, Cash offers one last life line for this homey to grab, before the jagged rocks below consume him utterly. "Hey... man. You go mugging yer customers, 's bad for business ain't it? I mean.. check that stuff. It's primo. I could be a cash cow fer you." The remains of the rocks are held out for the plucking, palm open and inviting. His other hand, meanwhile, has fingered out a small red chili pepper which is placed between his teeth. The 'hotter than shit' variety teeters in his choppers.  "Shut up, fucker. Only really stupid pieces of shit just up and offer prime shit like that!" The words are uttered with the sharp taint of rage that is followed by a quick step that draws the gansta even closer to the junkie. The gun is lifted in a sharp gesture as the rant is continued, "Any last words, bitch? Like an offer to suck my dick, you fucking homo?"  The rage only grows as another step is taken and brows draw together. Lips pull back from teeth far from the color of white in a bitter snarl. "Get on your knees, fucker." The hand is lifted slightly to direct the barrel towards the ground as the phrase is repeated with a harsh jabbing motion, "On your knees!"  The snap of the chili pepper's skin starts what appears a wildly stupid move to the untrained eye. Small white boy junkie versus gun wielding gangster on his turf. But this is beyond the eyes of his croonies, and this is no ordinary shmuck. The chili is crunched between his teeth, spilling its acidic contents into Cash's mouth. The sensation fuels a strike, now that the gangster has made the unfortunate mistake of pointing the tip of his barrel at the ground. He couldn't ask for a better opportunity to end this, real quick-like. And so what appears to be a drunken stumble forward ends in the deft protrusion of a two fingered strike to the underbelly of the would-be assailant's chin.   The strike aided by the configuration of his fingers, and the tingling of chili spreading over his tongue.  There's a harsh exhalation of breath between clenched teeth at the stumbling junkie's approach and the barrel of the gun starts to rise. Yet, the motion is far too late as the junkie moves past the barrel's end and places him within inches of the gansta. There's a sharp pain that prompts eyes to widen in shock to accompany the wet tearing sound of flesh and tissue giving way before force. The junkie's fingers slip past the boundary of skin in a spray of blood.  Muscles slacken as lips part, a crimson tinged bubble growing before his lips. Fingers slide from the striated grip of the gun with a clatter of steel and broken thought.  Lazy eyes drop to the crumpled mass below, Cash shakes his head at the waist and wipes his fingers on jeans stained by thousands of miles of concrete.   "Fuckin' mushugina."   At that, he bends at the knees to place the gun in his waistline, not that he'd know much what to do with the thing. At least his face is intact, it'll make it that much easier to copy. Wallet's next. He'll know the name; he'll know the 'alleged' address. If this gangster's not connected, he'll know someone that is. And the game will continue. The puffy Phila jacket looks retarded on Cash, and it's a tad too big. But when he leaves the alley, it'll fit just right. Away from prying eyes, fingers still ripe with blood are placed on ether side of Cash's Jewish face. This will be vulgar, but he's got time to kill. A little paradox sandwich, he'll enough it with a pickle.   The shifting of muscle and pigment is inaudible as he depresses portions of his skull that cause his skin to convulse. It feels right strange, but he's done it before. Cash, looking down at the dead dregs of humanity, slowly takes on the appearance of the failed criminal. Skin darkens, bones adjust. Within seconds, he's the shvatsa.   Attaining his new height, just a few inches taller, he tests his shoulders and rolls them. Knuckles crack as Cash gets used to this new form. For effect, he takes out the clumsy weapon on his waistline and points it down at the dead man's face.   *BAM*   That should alert his homies that the task is done, and when gangster runs out the alley clutching rocks and tucking away a piece, it's a good indication the white junkie will never be coming out of that alley again. The shot was placed close enough to the gangsta's face that he should be unrecognizable to forensics.   The first stage is done. Identity stolen, Gangsta Cash appears with a smile to his 'new' homeboys and takes off racing. "Fuckin' score, yo." He'll be back, to find the big fish at the end of this line.
