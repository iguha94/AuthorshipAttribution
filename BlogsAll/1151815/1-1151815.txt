         Things are a little slow at first. But, anyway: This scene involves some DJing on Hiro's part, and some pretty decent dancing on the part of the PCs. It takes place at Marcus (a CoX mage)’s birthday party. I think we have something going by tapping the whole rave culture meme. The traddies seem -very- receptive to it. I did some spellchecking and light grammatical editing here, to make it a more enjoyable read.  And yes, Pob, I fed her a line of total BS :) ---  Collecting his gear, Hiro dumps the majority of his crap back into the backpack; tucking the ream of records under his arm, and leaving the headphones hanging from his neck. He maneuvers to his feet, and sets into a stroll past Marcus and towards the sound setup; jerking a thumb over towards the turntables. "Open decks, right mano?" he asks, en route.  Millia dohs, of course, introductions would be nice. She smiles, "Tal, I'd like you to meet my friend Kasui. Kasui, this is Tal."  Marcus keeps his eyes on Kasui as both she and Kaze are pulled away. He moves his presents to the side where they are safe, then starts to wander back, while watching everyone. He grins.  Tal takes Kasui's hand and shakes it firmly Western-style before returning a bow from the waist with a sheepish grin. As he straightens he says, "It is nice to meet you Kasui."  Kaze chuckles at what Alyx says, "Fate often works in interesting ways, especially for folks of your persuasion, or so I am told."  Jess enters what's left of the Council Chambers by way of the ruined doorway. Jess has arrived.  After putting his guitar away, Abel heads over toward the food table. He seems to be more comfortable on the edges of the gathering, but smiles pleasantly to those he passes by.  "You have no idea," Alyx assures, agreeing somewhat with Kaze. "Still, here feels more comfortable than down in the city, though I'm not entirely sure /why/ yet. Do....do you think anyone will mind if I try and mingle?" The latter query is spoken with some hesitation, a note of shyness entering her voice.  Connelly 's leaning against the wall in an out of the way portion of the 'party'....  Marcus glances over to Hiro, his grin still bright. "Sure. Decks open. You wanna set up to play after Alex gets a few songs in, that's good by me."  Jess stops at the door in and blinks a lot. She looks around and just blinks several times at the tables and the people. "I really need to read notes more often..." she glances around for Millia or Tal.  Alex stands from the Seat of Correspondence and heads around the table for the keg. "Feel free to take over," he offers to Hiro just as Taproot's, Poem starts to play.  Millia is by the food table leaning comfortably against Tal, an arm around his waist, and a soft smile on her face. Currently they are both talking to Kasui who stands in front of them.  Hiro gives Marcus a cheeky thumbs-up, hopping over the load of wiring, and wedges his records between a pair of crates on the floor. A moment is spent inspecting the decks; thumbing the auxiliary output to the speakers off (so as not to interrupt the current music), and jacks his headphones into the base of the mixer. "Thanks, man," he answers, flashing a grin in Alex's direction. "Be a few minutes, though."  Abel grabs a plate and some sandwich stuff and makes a sandwich that would make Dagwood proud, as well as chips and, seeing Connelly against the wall, goes over to talk to her. "Not a big partier either, huh?" He offers some chips and a section of the sandwich he cut in quarters.  On his way over to the keg, Alex's eyes pass over the table of pills. He then notices Jess and gives her a nod in greeting, "Hey, Jess. How are you doing?..." he says as he refills his cup.  Kaze shakes his head speaking with Alyx, "No, not at all. Just be sure to introduce yourself if they have any questions." Jess nods to Alex "Doing pretty good you?" her attention diverted for a moment now.  Kasui's handshake is, of course, very gentle to the point of being limp. The firmness of Tal's shake surprises her a bit, as evinced by the way she blinks even if in no other way as she says, "The... you are Mirriya-san's... ah... teacher?"  Alyx smiles a touch. "No problem," she murmurs softly, then adds with a crooked smile, "I feel like a child on my first day at school." Then, that said, she turns away from Kaze with a slight incline of her head, and drifts towards the music setup; towards Hiro.  Connelly looks at Abel, and shakes her head, “No...Not one for partying around mostly people I do not know....If I were to party.. I would rather have a number of friends there....if that makes sense.."  Alex pauses a moment to consider Jess' question, covering the pause with a drink of his beer. "Pretty good," he finally says in response,” Busy..."  Tal nods to Kasui and smiles, "Yes, I am, for what its worth. She is an excellent student. Picks up on things amazingly quickly. You'd think she had the benefit of a past incarnation telling her what to do." He squeezes Millia fondly. Abel nods to Connelly. "I understand completely. Chip?"  Jess nods softly "Heading over.." gestures towards the food table and Tal and Millia "Busy can be good." already walking away from Alex though to Millia's side.  One studio headphone propped against his ear -- held snug by his shoulder -- Hiro slips a record onto the left table, setting the needle down. No music emits from the speakers, but some kind of heavy, thumping beat is audible if one is in close proximity. "S'up?" he asks Alyx, head bobbing to follow the beat; his hands play across the mixer controls, adjusting sound levels to his taste. "Sorry about Daze earlier, girlie. Whatisname, Aaron, had her mondo paranoid."  Marcus seems lost in the party, watching everyone intently. He moves over toward one of the unopened crates, popping it open and sorting through the stuff. He laughs, softly, while in the box.  Connelly smirks.."I would rather not touch anything here I didn't make myself....no-telling what those are chips of....I do have to be at the hospital tomorrow for my shifts...  Millia blushes slightly at the compliment as she reaches back behind her to take both of Tal's hands in hers. She chuckles, "Don't listen to him...he really is a better teacher than what he makes himself out to be."  Mention of Aaron, draws Alex's attention to Hiro. "Aaron giving trouble?" he queries.  Abel shakes his head. "Marcus wouldn't do anything like that. He knows some of us don't do that stuff and would never force it on them unknowingly."  Alyx lets slip a chuckle as she muses to Hiro, "Burning houses and human excrement. So I remember. Do you think perhaps when all this good stuff is over, you could tell me more? I guess she was understandably...reluctant." And, randomly changing subjects without a clutch, she then wonders, "Have you ever listened to a drum machine set onto 'random'?" Connelly wells..."Unfortunately...I do not know him...in fact...I really do not know many around here yet..."  Kasui 's mouth curves at the edges in that sad phantom-like half-smile as she replies with a lavish warmth, "You seem to have a close relationship. I am sure, despite what you say, Mirriya-san, it is all true. Perhaps you even do have a past incarnation to help you through unknowing."  "Nah, but I once wired a drum machine to synch with Dave's -- that's Pobble's monkey -- circadian rhythm while he was tripping balls." Even the monkey's a drug addict. Big surprise. "Killer samples." A thumb nudges the edge of the record, skipping it forward a few beats, and Hiro slides the crossfader all the way to the other side; settling a second record onto the right deck. "You a tech-head?"  Marcus peers over at Connelly, "Those are potato chips," he says. Good hearing on that guy.. wow. "And, if you don't know people, here's your chance to get to know them. You're not gonna get to know them standing over there." He grins, making his way toward her.  Abel nods to Connelly and turns to look around the room. He points over toward Tal and Millia. "Well that's Tal. He's a Chorister like me. Millia there with him is his student. I really haven't had a chance to talk to her, but I hear she's a dancer." He then points to Jess. "Jess... Well Jess is Jess. Marcus," He points, grinning at the man as he comes over "The birthday boy, is a Cultist."  Alyx shakes her head, amused by the thought. "Far from it, in most cases. I can just about handle sending email and playing solitaire, and occasionally programming my VCR - well, when I used one, anyway," she responds with a wry smile.  Abel takes a bite of his well stacked sandwich and offers a wedge to Marcus.  "Ah-so," returns Hiro, crouching down slightly to fiddle with the connectors on the right table, straightening, and tagging a few buttons on the mixer. A finger touches down on the left record, an analog-rewind back to the beginning of the track. He twists a couple more dials, and lets his hand come to a rest on the sound board. "You dig hard trance?" he asks, tagging a button. ...and the music dies. What the hell?  Kaze wanders his way over to where Kasui Millia and Tal are talking, ever Kasui's quiet shadow, "Good evening Millia-san, it is good to see you again." he says from the edge of the conversation.  Jess stops by Millia and Tal and smiles brightly to Millia "Heyas..." looking past her at the food table. "What are the different pills?"  "Some, yes. The kind where you can immerse yourself in the pattern - sorry, the beat, and find new ones all of your own making." Alyx frowns slightly as the music dies, head cocking a touch to the side.  //.etro: Hiro rolls "arete" to staff only at diff 4.          For a total of 2 success(es).  Millia shrugs at Jess' inquiry, "Dunno, got me." Then she smiles to Kaze, making the introductions, "Tal this is Kaze, and Kaze I'd like you to meet Tal."  Connelly nods.."I have Met Millia, Tal, and Jess...I know they are really more suited to just staying off by themselves..."  Tal smiles down at Jess and shrugs noncommittally. He turns to look at Kaze who has just been introduced to him. To avoid any further culture clash he keeps his hands to himself.  Not that Tal has a choice, as Millia's holding them.  Jess looks much to curious for her own good, she reaches out and picks up one of the heart shaped pills and pops it, seems testingly before turning and leaning up against Millia. "Hi" she chirps to Kaze and Kasui  Kaze half-bows to Tal, his shoulders mostly, "Hajimemashite, and pleased to meet you." he says seemingly equally at home in both languages as he offers his own hand in a seeming attempt to put Tal at ease. "To have a student like Millia-san speaks well of her teacher."  Kasui murmurs quietly, "I am glad you caught up with me Sempai," something softly mischievous in her voice as her amber gaze is slitted within half-lidded epicanthic folds. Jess receives a bow and a warm gaze, "Hello Jessu-san. How are you doing?"  ...silence. The little death of a party. 	--and, then, the music comes back as a low, subliminal thrum: bass rattling at a level that's felt in the bones rather than heard, a low -thump thump thump- that rises up through the floor, suffuses the room, and -- as it peaks, and Hiro twists two dials simultaneously to redline -- explodes into an audible matrice of sound.  Tal bows to Kaze from the waist and then frees one hand from Millia to shake Kaze's. He speaks, "Thank..." before the explosion of sound cuts him off.  Marcus peers back at the sound as he dips down into the ICEBOX (that he forgot to put in the desc of the Stuff), pulling out a can of soda. He grins, then shouts out, "Those speakers aren't supposed to put out that much sound!" And then laughs. Shaking his head, he wanders over toward Connelly, holding out the can. "Here.. enjoy the party." He smiles.  Alyx considers the speakers, then the DJ behind them, shaking her head in more apparent amusement. "I'm going to go over to the food table," she murmurs, just loudly enough to be heard over the thumping music. "Do you want anything while I'm there?"  Connelly smiles at Marcus..."Maybe I am? This is more an opportunity to see what others are like...I really am not much of a party person...."  "Sorry," calls Hiro over the noise, flashing a grin in Marcus' direction. The sound begins to fade away from it's mind-piercing levels of it's own accord; sliding back into the realm of being comfortable party conversation material. It's likely it didn't come entirely from the speakers -- kid was showing off. "Yah, grab me some party favors," he answers, cocking his head to the side again, and administering to the second record.  Kaze's attention is also snapped in Hiro's direction as the sound explodes throughout the Chamber raising a brow slightly but seems to take it in stride turning his attention back to Tal.  Alyx nods, drifting over to aforementioned table and beginning to load up two plates, a variety of foods on each. She takes her time about it, fingers drifting over the food about an inch above touching it, as if she's selecting the 'perfect' one. Weird.  Millia winces at the blast of music, then smiles, liking the beat. She let's Tal finish what he was saying though before saying anything else.  Abel nods to Connelly and points over toward Hiro. "Hiro over there I just met today, but I like 'im. He's cool to talk too." He looks around the rest of the room, hmming to himself.  Jess looks thoughtful as the heart shaped pill doesn't bite her or taste bad and leans more against Millia as she leans down and snags a white one pulling back to pop it. She looks between Tal and the others talking.  Abel says, "I don't think I really know any of the others."  Connelly nods..."Well....point out those from the Cabal called the Invisible College? I would much prefer to avoid them..."  Kasui's body tenses a she jumps just slightly in the wake of the sudden music, but she quickly seems to decide she likes the groove herself. For all of her demure and traditional seeming ways she lets the side of her that experienced the techno-mystic Hongkong nights surface with its plethora of nightclubs and modern rhythms. No one could accuse her of being a good dancer per se, but her body's natural balance and hand-eye coordination goes a long way for making gyrating hips and a bounce to the beat seem fairly attractive. Reaching over, as she is near the food table anyway, she fills a cup with the frothy beer in the mini-keg and take s along draught.  Marcus holds out the can to her, still smiling. "Well, here's a Coke for ya, if you want it. Relax, drink up, and absorb the music." He grins. "I'm gonna get back out there and enjoy myself." He sets the can down on the top of the broken wall beside her, then nods, flowing back out to the people.  Abel points. "Hiro is the only one here." Abel waves to Marcus as he wonders into the crowd.  Alex takes another drink of his beer as he makes his way over to the food table. He fills another plastic cup with a selection of fruit and then turns to look over those that have gathered. Looking to see who has migrated where.  Connelly nods..."OK...so...everyone else here is safe...  Alyx is likewise at the table, just putting the finishing touches to the two plates of party food she's assembled. Considering, she then reaches for cups, apparently planning to add drink along with it.  Tal begins moving slightly to the groove that Hiro is playing. He gives the young man a thumbs up before returning his attention to the group he's standing with.  Alex leans back against the table, looking over to Connelly. "I suppose that depends on what you idea of 'safe' is..." he comments.  Millia laughs watching the bouncing Kasui, "You look so cute." After saying that though she begins to dance. Unlike Kasui, she has had dancing lessons, and did very well. This girl has to have been a club kid at some time as her arms glide out in front of her and up in a fluid and graceful motion, then back behind her head, as she starts to bounce to the beat.  Abel blinks. "What's up with you and the IC, if I may ask?" He also seems to feel the rhythm of the trance, but he keeps pretty controlled himself.  Serene? Well he may be most of the time, right now however Kaze seems to just let the beat take him enjoying the party and the music. He seems somewhat at home in the techno beats, perhaps he spent time in the futuristic heart of Tokyo or similar places as well as the reclusive Shrine he hails from.  At first glance, Alyx might seem unaffected by the music, though she's definitely in a good mood. A nod is offered towards Alex before she departs the table, heading back to the DJ to deliver homage in the form of food and Newcastle Brown.  Well now that Millia is dancing, Tal no longer stops himself. He moves back just a little bit to give himself room and begins to dance. He has no natural grace or lessons to guide him. Just a sense of music that seems supernatural in and of itself and the presence to carry off whatever he does in front of a group of people. Passion radiates through his movements as if the music flows through him in some visceral way so that it appears sometimes that he's telling the music what to do instead of the other way around.  Abel is standing off to the side talking to Connelly currently, bobbing a bit to the music and eating a sandwich.  Kaze grins slightly looking in Kasui's direction, but generally Millia and Tal as well, "Remember Kohai, the great sage Kung-Fu-Tzu said "The Noble Person is not a Tool." his grin is slightly devilish.  Connelly wells..."Safe..as in...not likely to insult me just because I am Irish like their leader, some guy who *CLAIMS* to be a doctor...Or who is not more drug addled than an Ecstatic."  Marcus slides over to the Council table. He peers down at the white pills, then chuckles and reaches for a couple. He meanders across to the other table, gets a cup of ale, then downs the two pills, happily, and chugs down the drink and lets himself flow into the music.  The beat slides down, returns, slides away, and bursts back into full force as Hiro slides the crossfader back and forth; behind the decks, he almost seems like a different person. Perhaps he's actually sober, for once. Thankfully, whatever harsh words Connelly has for the Invisible College, Hiro is too absorbed in his music to pay much attention. The first track glides smoothly into the second, and he unloads the leftmost record: leaning over to locate a replacement. "Thanks, chica," Hiro addresses Alyx, once he's come up with a second record; fitting it onto the table. He pats an unoccupied stretch of platform, probably indicating for her to set the chow down.  Jess leans away from Millia as she starts to dance and watches with a grin now, she watches Tal as well though before looking at Kasui comparing notes perhaps before she joins in. She waits until the music bursts back into full force and then starts to dance, it seems most reminiscent of Millia's style.. perhaps that is where she has been learning.  Alex watches Connelly for a moment after her statement, a slow nod. "I can see that you are going to get along really well here," he comments,"...Not that I, personally fit anything that you seem would consider unsafe...."  Kasui finishes off her cup of beer and shakes her shoulders as her long fount of midnight tresses splashes in a spray about her visage, amber eyes glittering as she lets a giggle of sheer abandon drift from her lips, "No way! YOU know how to move, Mirriya-san!" Kaze's words get a faint shake of the head as she shrugs and throws her arms up, moving her hands through her hair and shaking the side-tail she had bound it in out with the removal of the band that held it in place.  Rather than set the food down straight away, Alyx perches herself on that empty spot, depositing both plates on the platform beside her, along with two plastic cups of ale. "No problem, maestro."  Well if she's gonna dance to techno, Millia might as well get out some glowsticks. Yup, she very definitely a club kid as she pulls two glowsticks connected by a string from her purse lying on the floor. As the music kicks up in beat so do the lines of light that start to form on either side of her body.  Abel nods to Connelly. "They are a bit out there, but we're connected in the One and Agape says to love everyone."  Abel looks a bit abashed then. "Listen to me... it's a party and I'm talking religion and philosophy."  Kaze watches Millia, his head canted to one side with amused interest as his eyes follow the glowing lights, "You wouldn't happen to have more of those would you?" he asks just loud enough to be heard.  Alex turns his head a little, a sideway glance at Abel, from behind the shades. "Well, whatever the One and Agape says," he says looking back to Connelly,"They are on our side. Might as well, at least, be civil to them...."  Millia nods to her now open purse, that has several glowsticks attached to and not attached to strings in there.  Skipping the next record to match the first's beat, Hiro bobs his head slowly, repeatedly, and slams the crossfader with the heel of his hand; kicking into the new track. That slide he's inching up must be the tempo, because the beat -- a strangely mellow track, at first -- is slowly gaining in volition: edging up towards a hundred and fifty bpm. Headphone still braced against his shoulder, he flashes a grin in Millia's direction, indicating her with beat-bobbing index and middle fingers. "Girlie's goin' off," he comments towards Alyx, before returning to his music.  Kasui carefully flows in her gyrating swirl of liquid motion so that she has positioned herself to form a third point of a triangle with Millia and Jess. There is no doubt now that she is simply watching and moving her body in a manner reminiscent of theirs, even if with far less skill and experience in doing so. It remains, simply, that she is someone who knows her own body well , though, and as her limbs and body smoothly ripple through the waves of music that crash over ad through her, the primal feel of connectivity to the sound itself is no small thing. All throughout this her thigh-length tresses, now loose and free at their maximum length, fail and sway about her in a an almost counter-dance, like liquid midnight encircling her.  Jess blinks a little bit losing herself in the lights and coming to a dead stop as she just stares at the lights Millia is twirling. When Millia pauses Jess sucks in a deeper breath and grins. "Can I have one or two as well hon?"  Alyx smiles somewhat, nibbling on a chip thoughtfully as she watches the three dancing women, nodding a touch. "Love the glowsticks," she murmurs in response, swaying just a touch from side to side, despite practically being sat on one of the speakers.  Not to be outdone by Millia, Tal's whirling movements seem to take on a more predatory stance, as if the dance he first learned was of the street fight. His eyes begin to glow a bright blue as do his fingers where they stick out of the gloves. Now if anything he seems lost to the world around him caught up in the music and the beat as if this were some sort of secret prayer to his God.  Connelly frowns,"Well...personally...considering the fact that the limey bastard who leads this Invisible College automatically hates me because I am from Eire...well...the Leader of a Cabal speaks for the Cabal.."  Marcus starts to drift through the music, his moves slow, even through the quick beat. He flows more like water than flesh, legs, arms, and body all coordinating to carry him across and through the old Certamen circle, kicking up age-old dust under his shoes. Eyes closed, he seems to allow the music pass through him and guide him forward. Slowly, his motions begin to stretch and blur, literally, as if he were moving in slow-motion through the beat. Perhaps he really is..  A sheaf of black rectangles is unloaded from his bag -- now mostly empty -- and Hiro abandons his post behind the decks; letting the track run on. He deposits the fliers on the edge of the refreshments table, shooting a sideways glance towards Conelly and Abel. "Pobble's family got hit by the IRA," he replies, quietly, shoulders rolling silently. "And the Invisible College doesn't have a leader." With that, he heads back to his post.  Kaze reaches down drawing two pairs of two glowsticks attached by a string from her purse with a wide grin upon his face and pausing for a moment one in each hand, the others hanging down he closes his eyes to focus letting the beat of the music flow over him and then well he sets them in motion. Fast motion to, they blur and spin seeming to dance through the air leaving streaks of after-image as he whirls them not with the skills of a raver but those of an expert martial artist, it's an advanced kata that glows. Though despite all the fancy moves and keeping two separate strings going at once he doesn't hit anyone around him, a few might seem to come close but the 'weapons' seem like extensions of his being as he creates a beautiful lightshow to the beat.  Never to be outdone, Millia nods to Jess as she circles of light spin up above her then beside her moving in an ever fluid motion. Somehow this chick manages to even move around and spin in a circle while keeping the glows going, as they spin around her own graceful motions.  Jess reaches into the purse and grabs a red glowstick on a string and a blue one for her other hand, not nearly good enough for two strings yet. She starts to giggle uncontrollably now at Tal and calls over the music "Cheater" but it is entirely good natured though she seems to be having trouble to stop giggling. She starts to twirl the one on the string getting it ripping before focusing enough to cause her other hand to twirl the blue light in a pattern. This she seems to have practiced as well.  Alex glances over to Hiro when he makes his comment about Pobble and then looks back to Connelly. He gives a small shrug,"I guess that this Pobble blames anyone that is Irish for the death of his family. Hardly rational, but understandable that he would be angry and want to have something to focus his anger on..." Another shrug is followed by a long drink of his beer.  Abel blinks when he hears Hiro's comment, but the young man is gone and the music is loud and It seems Abel is sort of concentrating on other things as the power and music wash around him.  Alyx leans over to Hiro as he returns to his decks, wondering curiously. "Who is this 'Pobble' person?"  Hiro's set moves on; his vibe seemed a little harshed by the brief interaction with Conelly, but he settles back into the music after a few minutes; harshing a transition, near the beginning, with a slightly off-set beat. He corrects the mistake quickly enough, however; taking a break from the tables to palm something from his bag, and wash it down with liquid from one of the plastic cups. "He's our chemist," he replies, shoulders rolling. "You'd know'm if you saw'm. He's got this crazy blue pigtail thing goin' on."  Kasui practically skips over to the purse, a glow of intensity about her that brings a glint to her eyes of purest enjoyment. Pulling forth a pair of glow-sticks she, in a way, follows both the example of the other two girls and does something similar to Kaze as she seamlessly blends the motions of the stringed glowsticks into her simple, primal, gyrations. The air around her HUMS as she whips the sticks around wit the control of someone who has trained close-combat weapons for the better portion of their lives yet with the abandon of someone who is simply letting go in a rare and much-needed expression of something deep within. Spirals and circles wrap and overlap, and there is no use of magick to aid it. Natural hand-eye coordination and trained reflexes make it seem as though she is literally encased in an aura of glowing light from the speed with which she whips the lights about her body.  Connelly clenches and unclenches her first at Hiro's comment..like she wants to say something...but...she will not ruin Marcus' party by brining things up...she just shakes her head, and looks at Abel,"My first mentor, who meant more to me than my own mother, dies in an IRA bombing of a subway station...however..it was protestants who nearly killed my sister by burning my home down..." She just shakes her head, her voice having a tinge of sadness in it...not anger. She turns her attention to watching Kasui and Millia dancing...and sighs a little wistfully...  Well then...you cheaters...guess Millia has to bring something else out of her apparent toy box to dance with. The strings are reeled in the glowsticks are soon in her hands, a solid glow of light flowing down one arm to the other as she moves to her purse and grabs for something with a single hand. With a single pull a small baton is in her hand as a black rhythmic ribbon comes streaming out of her purse, with stars painted up and down it which glow like glowsticks. One smooth motion of her arm and the lines of stars are above her and spinning down towards her as she moves away from the table again.  Kaze's body seems to flow almost inhumanly smoothly going even beyond that which is normally associated with advanced practitioners of Do as the glowing circles of light dance around him as he directs them through the katas that would normally be done with Nunchaku or similar chain weapons. A couple jumps are added the sticks twirling beneath him while he hangs in the air for a few seconds on each one before landing easily. As if that wasn't enough though his sticks begin to glow a bright neon and their trails elongate creating some spectacular effects indeed.  "Chemist?" Alyx muses, her voice still reflecting curiosity, even through the music. "Odd. Anyhow...I don't think we ever got properly introduced, except for the other girl, Daisy, calling you names." She almost offers her hand over, intent changing as she realizes he's probably got his hands full, what with flicking switches and sliders, spinning and changing the media...all that jazz.  Tracers abound around the birthday boy's limbs, his body still shifting and moving with the beats. Marcus is still lost in the music, occupying a small space on the floor near the center of the circle. As he moves, he alternately mixes in a half-break, some pure dance, and liquid. His tracers aren't drug induced; his look more like what you would see if the motion blur caused by speed was slowed down astronomically... strange.  Tal begins to perform nigh acrobatic moves that would make an Olympic gymnast seem well, not klutzy, but outclassed by comparison. His glowing fingers and eyes whirl in the darkness as he backflips and somersaults through the air with near superhuman agility. Sometimes it almost seems as if he could fly with a bit more oomph behind it.  A thumb tags the sampler, as the obligatory weird-ass vocals kick into place: not the usual saccharin cheese, really -- but, as Strongbad pointed out, it's probably from some old sci-fi movie. He keys in a few effects on the sampler, letting the voice ('This is the place of my birth...birth...birth') echo out, slowly fading away through the course of the track, and into the following piece. He's rapidly running out of records; he probably didn't expect such a positive response. "'s Hiro," he offers, during an allowable break in his attentions; offering Alyx a hand. "DJPB." If anyone knew what the letters meant -- well. It's his private self-directed joke.  Euphoria and just a generalized feeling of happiness seem to pour out from Millia as she dances now with her rhythmic ribbon in her hand, stars flowing around, above, and to her. It seems to be flowing from her fill the room.  Alyx stakes and shakes the hand briefly, quick enough that she doesn’t impede his work. "Alyx," she replies thoughtfully. "Do you even need the rest? I was always told to do a full introduction the full time over...rank, order, all that crap."  Jess just stops and wobbles a little eyes wide as she looks from Millia and Tal and Marcus and Kasui and Kaze... mouth open a touch like she is a touch overwhelmed or perhaps a little to Euphoric now. She has this silly grin on her face though and has finally stopped giggling.  Abel watches the goings on around him but doesn't quite seem to see them... or maybe seeing more than is readily apparent.  "Bani Order of Grumpy Old Men, bani rune-hackers, initiate exemptus blah blah blah," drones Hiro, flashing his teeth at Alyx again. "Save the titles for the wrinkle-bags, I say." And this would be why his reputation in the Order is so shoddy. Back to the music.  Alyx laughs brightly at Hiro's response, shaking her head. "Perfect. Just...perfect," she replies with a chuckle, sliding from her perch down to the floor. "In any case, I have to make a move. Things to do early on."  Kasui extends her arms to her sides and lets her glow sticks wrap about her wrists as she stops moving for a moment. Heading off to one side, actually where the presents were placed as it seems a safe place, she quickly strips off her trenchcoat, wrapping what seems to be shaped like a sword beneath it and then tosses her sweater atop that. She then, letting the stringed glowsticks whirl from her hands again, dances a slowly flowing path back to Millia and Jess, falling back into rhythm with them now that she is considerably less burdened than before.  Kaze releases the glows sticks letting them fly into the air, really not distinguishable as more than balls of light now with the neon glow coming from them as they begin to dance on their own as if he was still controlling them and begins executing acrobatics to rival Tal.  Hiro flashes a peace-sign in Alyx's direction, still grinning: whatever he palmed earlier seems to have hit his bloodstream, and it shows in the music. The last record takes a twist towards the frenetic, and Hiro's cranking the tempo up to something closer to challenging levels for all these crazed martial artists; regular skips surfacing as he overlays repetitive scratching with the second deck.  Alex remains leaning against the table, picking chips from the bowl, occasionally and washing them down with his beer. His eyes move around the room. Watching both the dancers and the DJ.  Abel shakes his head to clear it a bit. "I need Air." He starts to make his way around the dancers to leave the room, his grey eyes still a bit distant looking.  Millia seeing Tal and Kaze's display of acrobatics drops her mouth a little, although this girl doesn't even miss a beat as she continues to dance. At an appropriate time in the music the stars spin away from her. Have you ever seen someone who knows Capoeira dance before? Well if you haven't, you're seeing it now. While not flying overhead, Millia's movements and acrobatics look amazing as she dances about the room.  Kasui 's near to completely bare torso glistens as flowing waves of delicately toned muscle ripple beneath the surface and make the vivid dragon tattoo that takes up most of her back see to spring to life. She spins about, her palms planting on the floor as she lets the strings wrap about her ankles, releasing them from her hands and rising into the air with her second spin to bring a spinning butterfly kick about in a breathtaking crescent at head level. As she lands she simply rolls her hips letting them sway and undulate in the vacillating release of the moment.  Jess curls a bright grin on her face, playful really and then she arches her back dropping the glowsticks to the floor with a unheard clatter. Her form collapses coalescing with a strobe-like flash into a ball of golden light. She is about the size now of a softball, warm golden and glowing as it bobs in the air there. Quite similar to the glowsticks glow but golden and a bit warmer. The ball starts to bob a little faster then twirls out moving quickly around Millia in a spiral that passes through the ribbon ethereally now and then without actually messing the other girl up.  Kaze lands in a perfect Crane Stance balanced only on the toes of one foot long after he should have landed. He holds both hands out in front of him palms up and one of the glowsticks, having finished their stringless aerial dance, falls neatly into each hand as he pauses a moment to crack his neck, "I haven’t cut loose like this in a long time." he says with a broad smile on his face, seeming to have succeeded in escaping the worries and concerns that might normally plague him, or just momentarily leaving the vaunted Akashic serenity by the wayside as the case may be.  Abel stays clear of Marcus as he heads of the room. He has a clue as to what's going on there and doesn't feel like fighting it right now.  The final track begins to slow down, then rapidly accelerates: hitting an insane tempo peak that stretches out into a self-looping repetitive jitter, exploding into a final crescendo of sound which -- if it's natural, and that's beyond unlikely -- suggests concealed, immensely powerful speakers. 	Slowly, the beat begins to wind down, and Hiro slaps a CD into the Discman, engineering a final transition into some stock high-energy Sasha to smooth out the end of his set.  Kasui lets her entire body simply fall limply to the floor, where, like a serpent, she writhes in sensuously undulatory waves until she upturns her body into a hand-stand and then bounces from hr hands onto her feet again. Spinning in a downward spiral she extends her left leg in a motion that sweeps above the floor like a propeller blade only to raise, on the ball of her foot and still spinning, to her full height where she extends that left leg above her head and holds it there by gripping her foot with one hand.  Kaze finally drops out of the Crane Stance tossing the glowsticks back near the purse from whence they came and goes in search of something to drink.  Alex’s head moves back and forth as he eyes move over the people on the make-shift dance floor, from behind the shades. His head stops moving when Jess shifts into the ball of light, perhaps watching her... it from behind his shades.  Extricating himself from behind the tables, Hiro retrieves the drink Alyx fetched for him; downing it in one long draught. He watches the dancers wordlessly for a long moment, a lingering smile -- which, by his pupils, is as chemical as it is vibe-induced -- fixed on his face. A sideways flicker of attention towards Conelly, then: his smile falters just faintly, and he edges off towards the woman. "Hey," he prompts, "..sorry about my friend, huh? He gets a little out of it, sometimes, you dig. He don' mean anything by it."  Marcus finally slows himself down (or is that, speeds himself back up?). The blurs fade, bringing him back to normal. He's sweating now, beads of it curling on his forehead and glistening on his arms. However, his eyes are still closed. He breathes slowly and carefully, then suddenly... stops. His eyes open, glazed over and unseeing, and he stares across the room, frozen in place. "Ah.. ah.. huh..." He starts to reach out toward The Chair, then begins wandering toward it. He starts to murmur something, but the music.. the music is too loud..  -- Here things get all weird and wonky. Pick up the log for that elsewhere. :)
