         You walk down the hill and through the small valley, approaching Novus Valnastium. As you crest the next large hill, you arrive, opening the door and heading into... Novus Valnastium -- Main Chamber          The main hall of Novus Valnastium is a wide, stone area, with arching buttresses and columns framing windows that stream with bright, comfortable light. Several circles of chairs and old-fashioned divans and davenports are scattered around the room, conversational areas if you will, and a center hearth flickers with a warm, comfortable flame. A set of stairs on the left leads up to a balcony that rings the area, several doors leading off it, and great double doors lead forward and to the left, right, and behind you. Two armored figures, silent as the grave, flank the doors ahead of you, as well as two others flanking the doors to the rear, which lead back out onto the open plains.  Obvious exits: Out to Fields    Laboratory Doors    Library Doors    Council Chambers     Penny shouts, "Daaaaisy, Daaaaaaisy" it's a sing songy, girly voice "give me your answer, do. I'm half craaazy..."          Two massive, dark-finished oaken doors, rimmed and lined in silver and steel. Through them lie the Council Chambers of Novus Valnastium.  Nearby, a female voice shouts, "Well, hell. If it ain't Penny Dreadful."  You open the double doors, heading into the Main Hall beyond. Novus Valnastium -- Council Chamber          This room is mostly empty, even more vast in some ways than the hall outside. Only three things mar its granite perfection; an immense marble table at the head of the room with nine chairs, each marked with a single Sphere glyph, an intricately inscribed Certamen circle in the center of the room, and perhaps forty seats at the back of the room, for observers and audience. A single door to the left glows a soft gold.         The great marble table seems to be carved from a single piece of stone. Polished and pristine, the table stands as if it had stood here for an eternity, its circle unbroken and complete. Each seat surrounding it is spaced evenly, as if meticulous care has been given toward seeking this state of equality.         The room is lit by a multitude of dim fires which rest in recessed pits along the walls. Here and there, candelabras stand, adding additional light to the chamber through their infinitely burning candles.                            >                           Contents: Daisy Niko Supplies Obvious exits: Left Door  Out   Penny pushes open one of the massive oak doors with her shoulder, kind of backing into it. Her hands are occupied, you see. Duct tape, a dark duffel bag. She's dragging a huge roll of industrial packing plastic. From the look of the dirt and grass divets caked up around the base, it's taken her a while. She's even a little out of breath.  "I've been looking everywhere for you."  "What, so I can schlep stuff around for you?"  Daisy is standing midroom, one hand jammed wrist-deep in her hoodie pocket,the other one holding her cigarette up to her lips. Long tangles of black hair hang down over her face.  Niko glances over at Penny, "You are a very fortunate young lady....I'd dare say you don't know how much so...". He shakes his head softly and then looks at Daisy and reaches in his back pocket and pulls out his wallet, fanning out 3 hundreds, "This help you get what you need?"  Penny watches the business without interrupting. She's used to waiting. And when it seems appropriate, Penny deadpans at Niko "Yeah. I heard they had me, too. But it's cool. It's cool" picking dirt out of her hair, kicking rocks out of her shoes "I got friends over there, friends over there too."  She props her things in the way of the door to keep it open, leans on the roll of plastic.  Eyes glittering with the craven hunger of the chronically impovershed, Daisy just stares -- unblinking -- at the money. Then, long fingers flexing, she flicks forward to take it.  "Yeah," she says casually, bobbing her head. "That's definitely enough to get me started. An' I suppose I'm in charge of being started, being, as I am, Friday and all. An' being Friday, an' Friday being the Sabbath, I ain't got to schlep shit for you, Penny. Unless of course it's for a good cause. Talmud says I can schlep shit for charity."  For a moment, she scowls.  "Keene totally nailed me on that point last week."  Niko arches a brow and shakes his head a little as if he's trying to fathom something about you all, "And to think..3 years ago..I would have asked to join your litle group..". He smirks a bit and moves back to the circle, 'Don't take any of Alex's shit...he'll be more pissed off than he already is and I don't need him thinking about anything but pissing off the Union with me..'  Squinting, Daisy holds one of the hundred-dollar bills up to the light, then turns it over and examines the other side. She gets to examine real currency far, far too infrequently.  "We don't want to be sowin' no discord in Q Division," says Daisy. "Don't worry -- if there's anything at all Daisy Inscrutable's good at, it's keepin' the peace."  Penny looks Daisy over like maybe there's something wrong, incorrect perceptions; reception isn't coming in clear. She looks Daisy over, mouth twisted shut, eyes on the money. Purpose.  "You're taking applications? I thought our roster was full. Plus we gotta get this shit started, bein'as it's five in the goddam and it won't cook itself. Plus, y'know .. you're Friday," indicating the roll to Daisy. An introduction, an invitation.  Kicking her boots against the roll of plastic again, Penny scratches her nails across her jeans, flicking out sand. Or salt. Something that makes noise when it hits the stone floor.  "Us plus Voodoo Eddie plus Eva plus the Eighth Day means we're full up," agrees Daisy, turning her back on Niko and slouching over to the sheeting. Delicately, she pushes it with the tip of her toe, waiting it for to rebound. Her expression passes through a dozen permutations of uncomfortable. "I think we're good with what we got now, P. I mean, there's always the possibility that --"  Eyes, hooded, jerk from Penny to a point just over her shoulder.   "-- I mean, you know what there's a possibility of. That ain't a good possibility."  Niko settles back in the center of the Certamen Circle and puts his laptop back on his legs, 'I don't want to join, ladies....I'm just trying to remember when I was like you both are..'  "You used to be a stupid cunt that wanted me to carry a big bloody roll of plastic on the Sabbath?", Daisy asks sweetly.  They commiserate quietly, the girls. It's this thing they do, talking with their eyes.  And Penny doesn't look happy, no, not pleased at all. "..but it's the rules,.." she hisses "We have to at least try. It's what, I mean it's not just the principle of the thing, it's the fucking letter."  A guarded glance at Niko "I'm serious, I didn't want any trouble. That shit, Alex? He doesn't know man.  Niko smirks a little at Penny and shrugs, "Neither did I..and you can see what it got me.."  Penny, uncomfortable in the doorway, broken-records "Yeah. Uh. So where's the body." She touches the edge of the plastic, tip-tip-flicking a corner between thumb and forefinger. Shrugging up her shoulder, the question merely perfunctory.   "Figure I can ask and you can tell me."  Niko shakes his head, "I have no idea...I didn't ask...but you're not going to get it..and I have a feeling if you don't return that head soon....all hell's gonna break loose.  Deer-in-headlights. Daisy literally locks up with indecision, unmoving for a second.  "I suppose it's charity," she says when she thaws.  Penny arches a brow, the left one, the one that can be seen. She says, in Enochian, "Daze, y'ever get the feeling you're just not being heard?"  Reaching into one of the apron pockets on her hip, Penny digs out a scissor and puts her wrist through the roll of duct tape. She says, in Enochian, "Come on, this is pointless."  Niko glances to Penny, "I'll run that through the universal translator later..". He looks to Daisy, "If you're sure I can't help....then just let me know what you need...I'll see what I can do instead of having you poke around Alex's stuff.  Daisy's brows knit up and her lips start to move slowly. It's obvious that she only vaguely understands the language that Penny was speaking in. After a moment, she sort of nods, shrugs, and mumbles, "Thanks, Aaron. I mean it. But I gotta go."  Penny gives Daisy the scissor in between some complicated gesture, her thumb and pinky fingers spread out. Kicking the door off the roll of plastic, she holds it open.  "Don't run with those."  Daisy takes the scissors. Daisy holds the scissors. Daisy is obviously trying to puzzle out what you said just a moment ago in Enochian, and not doing so well. If you can read lips, you can see her going through the rather arbitrary declinations of the word 'nowhere'.  Half of them are wrong.   Novus Valnastium -- Main Chamber          The main hall of Novus Valnastium is a wide, stone area, with arching buttresses and columns framing windows that stream with bright, comfortable light. Several circles of chairs and old-fashioned divans and davenports are scattered around the room, conversational areas if you will, and a center hearth flickers with a warm, comfortable flame. A set of stairs on the left leads up to a balcony that rings the area, several doors leading off it, and great double doors lead forward and to the left, right, and behind you.

Contents: Rhiamon Abel Paksenarrion Connelly Obvious exits: Out to Fields    Laboratory Doors    Library Doors    Council Chambers      Abel heads through the double doors, entering the Main Hall beyond. Abel has left.  Rhiamon is following after Abel.. Rhiamon heads through the double doors, entering the Main Hall beyond. Rhiamon has left.  Daisy arrives from the forward doors. Daisy has arrived.  Daisy and Penny are just leaving as, apparently, the entire population of the Chantry starts to head through into the Council Chambers. The former has a pair of scissors in one hand and a cigarette in the other; the latter has a giant roll of plastic sheeting behind her. Neither offers an explanation.  Paksenarrion looks at the giant sheet of plastic, "Off to desicrate more bodies?"  Lugging along slowly, Penny and Daisy are going over a few things. "The fourth  doesn't apply in cases of the personal. Like affronts or insults. But if you just conjugate with a verb like I did? it works. Cig me," a polite request as they walk "I'm only taking this as far as the next door then it's all you."  Daisy dips into her center pocket to cig Penny. "What door?", she asks.  Abel arrives from the forward doors. Abel has arrived.  Abel comes out of the main Chamber, heading toward the doors out of the keep.  Daisy and Penny are just leaving as, apparently, the entire population of the Chantry starts to head through into the Council Chambers. The former has a pair of scissors in one hand and a cigarette in the other; the latter has a giant roll of plastic sheeting behind her. Neither offers an explanation.  Abel looks at the two woman curiously. "Hey. What's up?"  "We're workin' on something," Daisy says cryptically, snapping her scissors in Abel's direction. "You'll see soon. Don' worry."  Abel holds his hands up defensively as the scissors snapp at him. "Sure."  "Eight days," Daisy says flatly.  Abel says, "Eight days till what?"  "That one," pointing Daisy at the library. She gets a sharpie out of her bag, bites off the cap and holds it there between her teeth. She starts writing on the duct tape, scribing circles, slashes, points on an axis. "Eight days," she repeats like it should be obvious enough. Matter of fact she's just like those annoying chain-store jingles that keep reminding you how many days there are til Christmas. "Eight days," tearing of that section. It gets slapped to the plastic sheet.  Daisy is not quite so cryptic.  "Eight days 'til you find out," she murmurs, eyes flicking to Abel for just a moment. Shivering and sober, she stands behind Penny's right shoulder, watching. Waiting. "Eight days 'til everyone finds out what we're up to. You'll love it."  Abel doesn't look too sure of that. "Eight days huh? Does this have something to do with Chase?" He stays a short distance away from the two women, obviously unsure how to interact with them. He glances at Daisy, noticing the state she's in. "Are you all right Daisy?"  "Don't worry, Abel. It's not a violation of the Council's order. I'm over that. We're just in planning."  As Abel speaks, Daisy wrinkles up her nose and bobs her head. You can see aftershocks -- muscle tremors -- across her shoulders and back. They're obviously uncomfortable.  "I'm just comin' down off of somethin'. It's ... not so good."  Abel nods to Penny and then to Daisy. "Believe it or not... I know," he says quietly.  "She's fine," an offhand comment, not really concerned. It's most likely that Penny's seen Daisy in far worse shape. "I'm fine. We're all fine except him. He's dead and you can't even help us honor him. Why are you letting Alex hide his body anyway? What's it to you?" This is rhetoric, these are complaints.  Tearing through the tape, Penny's fingers get stuck. "Cut that into about three headless Chase's," chinning to the plastic.  Snip. Snip. Snip.  "Don't worry about Penny," Daisy contradicts, giving Abel a look of genuine concern. Tic. Tic. Up goes the corner of her lip, but it's not a sneer; it's a twitch, and one she can't do anything about. "She's strung out. We're all a little strung out. Since Chase went out, we've been ... too much."  It's obvious what she's been too much of.  Abel blinks to Penny and nods to Daisy again. "I don't know where Alex has put the body. I wasn't around for it. And how are you honoring Chase? You guys never tell anybody what you're doing. You simply do your thing that nobody else understands. And then you expect us all to just... to just get it." He runs a hand through his hair in frustration. "And I think you like it that way."  "That's true," says Daisy contemplatively. Halfway done, she finishes cutting and looks up, red-rimmed eyes on Abel. "Would you like us to tell you more? We could tell you things, if we could find Hod. It's Hod's job to tell you things."  Penny is mapping out a lattice of tape. It looks like a net, the long lines of silver half stuck to the floor, criss-crossing. Fencing. On hands and knees Penny marks up the tape and starts pulling out tiny things from her pockets; copper wires, bay leaves, jet pebbles, bitter herbs. These things remain in a pile beside the near-complete sticky frame.  "No. Hod is not Keene."  "Okay, help me flip this over sticky and then put that" she points to the plastic "on this."  "Keene is the best Hod. Keene is deeply Hod," Daisy explains, carefully taking up one end of the net, carefully turning it over, and carefully lowering it onto the aforementioned plastic sheeting. She looks up at Penny expectantly, lip caught between her teeth, before continuing. "There's seven of us. There're seven days. There're seven Sephirot reflected upon the face of the supernal crown, Kether. Each of us, each of the members, is a day, a Sephirot, a name. Today I'm Friday, the Sabbath. Now, the Sabbath doesn't do any work, 'cause the Sabbath is head of the cabal, just as Eheveh rules the world and the father is the head of the house. Today Penny is Monday. Monday is more cryptic than the rest of us, because Monday is above the language of intelligences."  Her smile is wan, but still a smile.  "Be glad you ain't talkin' to Da'ath. Da'ath is silent, and a bitch to boot."  Abel smiles a little and moves to help keep the plastic and tape from getting caught where it isn't supposed to go. "Here, let me help. I really need to read up more on my Kabbalah."  Penny stops with a sharp intake of breath waiting there. And it issues forth in little put-put noises when she drops a corner for Abel to pick up since he wants to help.  Her gestures are slowing down, becoming more fluid. It's possible her facilities and acuity are leaving her.  "Now. Turn it over and litter the shroud with safe passage, enlightenment and sacrafice."  The pile, her eyes fix on the pile. The bay leaves, the bitter herbs, the jet. Who knows what the copper wire is for. Better leave it out.  Of course, it's plastic. It's duct tape. It's a rock. It's a leaf. It's silly, and it's not going to work.  Daisy is a mage because she has learned to ignore these things. Closing her eyes, she takes up the bay, scattering the sharp-spined herbs across the duct tape and plastic. Then the green-brown curls of herb, scattered carefully across the same area. Then, finally, the jet stones, which clack and clatter across the shroud beneath her hand. She's whispering a gutteral, inarticulate prayer underneath her breath, choking back sobs.  You always swear in the language of your birth. You always grieve in the religion of your parents.  Abel stands back and watches. He understands something is being done... something for Chase... and he bows his head in prayer as well.  //.etro: Penny rolls "arete" at diff 5          For a total of 2 success(es).  Abel prays under his breath "Eternal rest grant unto him oh Lord, and may perpetual light shine upon him.  Penny rests back on her heels. "And when they give us his body, we'll wrap him up and take him in among us," vacant-eyed she stares at a vanishing point. Head tilted to the side, her eyes go wide and slack. Swaying and rocking like some ecstatic, she might faint.  OOC> Penny says "awareness rolls if you're feelin'it."  Daisy's shoulders are tense, and her expression is hard, and she's staring at the shroud on the verge of crying.  "We will," she murmurs, "and our will is become flesh."  That's not something she would normally say, and it's lacking her characteristic insecure, gutterish diction.  Rhiamon arrives from the forward doors. Rhiamon has arrived.  Abel puts a hand on Daisy's shoulder comfortingly but doesn't say anything. Rhiamon enters from the Council chamber, yawning.  It's all on Penny, the energy, the resonance. This is clearly a meditation and you know she'll be here for hours. Another facet of the fasting, perhaps. She's made this little spot, the shroud and all part of a temporary domain. By touching it, the plastic, you can sense her presence and know if you stay there that your will could be subverted to her own.  Daisy, Abel, and Penny are clustered around three pieces of plastic sheeting, each roughly man-sized and man-shaped. A matrix of duct tape has been overlaid on each. The thick, pungent smell of asafoetida, fennel leaves, and horseradish rises from her. Baby leaves of romaine lettuce are scattered with jet stones and bay leaves.  Penny, kneeling, is sheened in an oracular sweat, eyes rolling up under closed eyelids, taut muscles vibrating with effort. There's no clear indication of what she's doing.  Rhiamon blinks, but doesn't interupt what is going on.  Abel turns and moves away from the powereful magicks and resonance of Penny's working, not wanting to get caught up in it. He remains quiet, contemplative.  Rhiamon mouths a greeting to Abel, and waves with a smile  Daisy stands without a word, and walks, straight-backed, out of the keep.  Daisy opens the two double doors leading out to the plains, leaving to enter the plains beyond. Daisy has left.  Abel smiles to back to Rhiamon with a bit of a shrug, and heads out of the keep as well, gesturing to Rhiamon to follow and remain quiet. Rhiamon nods, and picks her way over.  Abel opens the two double doors leading out to the plains, leaving to enter the plains beyond. Abel has left. Rhiamon opens the two double doors leading out to the plains, leaving to enter the plains beyond. Rhiamon has left.
