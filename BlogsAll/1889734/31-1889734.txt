           Star Telegram | 10/30/2003 | Reality vs. public relations :   This column by Ivins wasn't really notable, until I got to the following passage.  She's railing about the PR effort of the Bush White House to counter the negative propoganda of the mainstream media.  She said -   "George Nethercutt, a Republican congressman from Washington state, spent four days in Iraq and told an audience at home: 'The story of what we've done in Iraq is remarkable. It is a better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day.'"  Sounds terrible, doesn't it?  Heartless, cruel republican, dismissing the lives of soldiers so casually....  Unfortunately, Nethercutt had been DOWDified by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.  If you aren't aware, DOWDification is what Maureen DOWD did to President Bush, when she strung together two different parts of a sentence, dropping out some crucial words to make it sound like Bush said something he didn't.  She got away with it to, since the NYT reequired no correction even in the face of audio recordings of what Bush said.  Back to Nethercutt.  Here is what he said, as confirmed by an audio recording of his statement.    "It's a bigger and better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day, which, which, heaven forbid, is awful."   Make a difference?  I took this from Best of the Web on Wednesday.  If you are interested in the whole sorry affair, I'll paste it in here.   On Oct. 15, we approvingly  noted  http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110004168#nethercutt  a comment from Rep. George Nethercutt, a Washington state Republican who is challenging Sen. Patty Murray in next year's election. "The story of what we've done in the postwar period is remarkable," the Seattle Post-Intelligencer quoted Nethercutt, who had just returned from Iraq, as saying. "It is a better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day."    That day we received an e-mail from Mary Lane of the Nethercutt Senate campaign:    *** QUOTE ***    The Seattle P-I actually cut off the second part of Nethercutt's quote about losing soldiers in Iraq. Here is the full sentence (I have it on tape): "It's a bigger and better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day, which, which, heaven forbid, is awful."     As you know, the P-I put a period after "day." I contacted both the reporter and the editor and attempted to get the P-I to print a clarification, but to no avail.    *** END QUOTE ***   This struck us as a fairly minor complaint. The abridgment of Nethercutt's quote changed only its emphasis, not its meaning; and surely it goes without saying that the deaths of American servicemen are awful.    But in light of the way the Post-Intelligencer has been savaging Nethercutt since then, we have to conclude Lane had a point. First came an  Oct. 16 editorial  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/144006_iraqspined.html  denouncing "an effort to put a more positive spin on Americans' perception of the war in Iraq":    *** QUOTE ***    Then there was U.S. Rep. George Nethercutt's ham-handed attempt to redirect news coverage and public attention to the war's positive side. "It's a better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day," the would-be senator gaffed at a gathering Monday.    The family of Pfc. Kerry Scott of Concrete, who buried their young hero Tuesday, likely would not share Nethercutt's news judgment.    *** END QUOTE ***   Anyway, yesterday Nethercutt bought an ad in the Post-Intelligencer and the Seattle Times in which he accused the former paper of misquoting him, and this prompted the P-I to publish its first  news story  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/145724_nethercutt28.html  acknowledging the dispute. It quoted managing editor David McCumber standing by the story: "Congressman Nethercutt was quoted accurately and within context by the P-I, and that's sort of the beginning and the end of it, as far as I'm concerned."    But it wasn't the end of it as far as the paper was concerned. Today the paper ran a  petulant editorial  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/145809_nethercutted.html  denouncing Nethercutt again:    *** QUOTE ***    Consider, again, the quote in question--fleshed out a bit more.     "The story of what we have done in the postwar period . . . is remarkable," Nethercutt said, because the coalition has been rebuilding power plants, police stations, schools and other infrastructure, as well as taking early steps toward self-governance. "So the story is better than we might be led to believe in the news. I'm indicting the news people. It's a bigger and better and more important story than losing a couple of soldiers every day, which, which, heaven forbid, is awful."     A bigger and better story? Thank you, George, for clarifying your callow, shallow position.     *** END QUOTE ***   This followed a cartoon yesterday by the P-I's  David Horsey  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/horsey/viewbydate.asp?id=914 , which depicted Nethercutt standing up in the middle of a church, raising his hand, and saying: "Hey! Why don't you tell us the good news about Iraq?" The pastor replies: "Sorry, Mr. Nethercutt, maybe after the funeral." (Just to be clear, Nethercutt actually made his comments at the University of Washington, not during a funeral.)    Compare this with the P-I's response  last year  http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110002804#daycare , when Sen. Murray gave a speech in which she said the following about Osama bin Laden:    *** QUOTE ***    He's been out in these countries for decades, building schools, building roads, building infrastructure, building day care facilities, building health care facilities, and the people are extremely grateful. We haven't done that.    *** END QUOTE ***   The P-I published an editorial on  Dec. 26  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/101383_murrayed.shtml  praising Murray for, as the headline put it, having the "guts to stir needed debate." The paper praised every bit of Murray's statement, including even the claim about "day care centers"--after all, "there is apparently a long-standing rumor" that bin Laden "built an orphanage."    Now that Americans like Kerry Scott are in Iraq and actually are building hospitals, schools and other facilities, the P-I wants to suppress the news. An  Oct. 11 P-I story  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/143507_soldier11.html  on Scott's death quotes his father, David Scott, as saying of his son: "He was brave. He was a hero. He always wanted to help people." The Seattle Post-Intelligencer seems to have a big emotional investment in the notion that fallen heroes like Kerry Scott gave their lives in vain.
