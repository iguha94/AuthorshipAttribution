         The future of the Blog.  Honestly, I'm getting worn down by it.  Lately I've been nothing but disgusted by the anti-war critics, and the continued erosion of public poll numbers.  We're losing the war, and no one seems to recall why we are fighting.  We will pull out of Iraq too soon, and it will all revert.  People will ask why we did it, and inside of a year the terror groups will be back.  The whiners will be vindicated, and when the next attack comes, the Bush policies will be blamed.    Already, Afghanistan has released their draft Constitution, calling for an Islamic Republic and the dominance of Islamic Law.  We fought for this?  I'm losing faith in America.  I don't think our people have the strength to do what must be done, meaning that in a short 230 years or so, we have described the same arc as the first thousand years of Rome.  We all know where it ends, it's just a matter of time.  So I'm finding it harder and harder to summon the energy to read the daily ravings from the left, and struggling even more to care enough to respond.  So I might just let this go away.  At the least, I'll probably take a break until something happens to regain my interest.  I appreciate those that do take the time to read it.  Keep checking back.  If my mood changes, I'll begin posting again.  But for now, I don't feel like it is worthwhile.
