           Death Be Not Loud   DOWD!!  DOWD's words will be indented, mine will not.       There are those who say Mr. Bush should have emulated Rudy Giuliani's empathetic leadership after 9/11, or Dad's in the first gulf war, and attended some of the funerals of the 379 Americans killed in Iraq. Or one.  WHY? Why give a spectacle to the work of our enemies? Why celebrate their deaths? Does anyone doubt this would be seen as anything but a sign of weakness? The President no doubt cares for the soldiers in Iraq, but the fact is it is the job they want to do. They can quit anytime. Death is a possibility of the job, and the ultimate sacrifice should not be cheapened by the media's quest for sensation.       But let's look at it from the president's point of view: if he grieves more publicly or concretely, if he addresses every instance of bad news, like the hideous specter of Iraqis' celebrating the downing of the Chinook, he will simply remind people of what's going on in Iraq.  Does anyone really not know what is going on in Iraq? By "going on" DOWD and I both mean the bad news. No one it seems knows or cares about all the good being done. Or the ultimate good of freeing people from tyranny. A public display of grief by the President would only encourage the terrorists to redouble their efforts so as to get more of the same. This war requires stoicism, a much-maligned and misunderstood virtue. When the cost and results of terrorism are no longer worth the cost, such attacks will decrease. I still clamor for the Dead Terrorist Body Count ticker, just as we have the Dead US Soldier one.       So it's understandable why, going into his re-election campaign, Mr. Bush wouldn't want to underscore that young Americans keep getting whacked over there, and we don't know who is doing it or how to stop it.       The White House is cleverly trying to distance Mr. Bush from the messy problem of flesh-and-blood soldiers with real names dying nearly every day, while linking him to the heroic task of fighting global terror.  We DO know who is doing it, and we DO know how to stop it! This woman makes me want to erupt into profanity by her idiocy. If she was saying this to my face I would be unable to restrain physical action. We know the ones doing this are Muslim extremists and thugs. We know how to stop them. By finding them and killing them. And every day we come closer to that goal.   The President IS the foremost citizen in the war on terror. It exists because he is executing the collective will of the USA. Bush is not himself the one killing our soldiers, our citizens. Our enemies are killing them. And people like DOWD are giving aid and comfort to them, just as Jane Fonda and her ilk did in Vietnam. If our enemies knew for certain that we could not be dissuaded they would realize their cause is hopeless. Our job would become easier. But people like DOWD hate our nation, our very way of life. They want us to fail. They want power, to say how things should be. We must not let them ever regain power.        If he gets more explicit, or allows the flag-draped coffins of fallen heroes to be photographed coming home, it will just remind people that the administration said this would be easy, and it's teeth-grindingly hard. And that the administration vowed to get Osama and Saddam and W.M.D., and hasn't. And that the Bush team that hyped the presence of Al Qaeda in Iraq has now created an Al Qaeda presence in Iraq.  No one said this would be easy. I recall several speeches where the President told us it would be hard, full of sacrifice and dark days. This is actually far easier than I could have dreamed. The only truly "hard" part is in the minds of those like DOWD. We never vowed to get Osama and W.M.D. We vowed to make every effort to find them and neutralize them. The "created" presence of Al-Queda in Iraq is a godsend. Bring them on! Every soldier in Iraq knows that they are a shield for those of us in the USA. By drawing fire from the helpless they save lives. DOWD cheapens their sacrifice by saying it is pointless, that by losing this war we would be better off.        "If a helicopter were hit an hour later, after he came out and spoke, should he come out again?" Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, told The Times' Elisabeth Bumiller, explaining Mr. Bush's silence after the Chinook crash. The public, he added, "wants the commander in chief to have proper perspective, and keep his eye on the big picture and the ball."       The ball for fall is fund-raising. President Bush has been going full throttle since summer, spending several days a week flying around the country, hitting up rich Republicans for $2,000 checks. He has raised $90 million so far out of the $175 million he plans to spend on a primary campaign in which he has no opponent.  I think this is a great use of his time. He has deputies like the great Donald Rumsfeld to handle the daily concerns of the War on Terror. And Bush MUST become the nest President. The fight must continue to be won. He needs money so he can win the hearts and minds of an American public confused and deceived by the Left and their Media.        At fund-raisers, Mr. Bush prefers to talk about the uptick in the economy, not the downtick in Iraq. On Monday, arriving for a fund-raiser in Birmingham, he was upbeat, not somber. As Mike Allen of The Washington Post reported in his pool report, "The president, who gave his usual salute as he stepped off Marine One, appeared to start the day in a fabulous mood. . . . An Alabama reporter who was under the wing shouted, `How long will U.S. troops be in Iraq?' The president gave him an unnappreciative look."  I don't blame him! What an asinine question to ask. The answer has always been "Until the job is done." What other answer could there be but defeat? I am glad the President is putting on an air of confidence. It infuriates his adversaries and encourages his friends. It is obvious DOWD things the Commander-in-Chief should be totally depressed and despondent because of the Iraq "quagmire." Perhaps the truth makes some glad and others angry?       Raising $1.8 million at lunch, he stuck to the line that "we are aggressively striking the terrorists in Iraq, defeating them there so we will not have to face them in our own country." He didn't want to depress the donors by mentioning the big news story, the loss of 15 American soldiers, or sour the mood by conceding the obvious, that the swelling horde of terrorists fighting us there will not prevent terrorists from coming after us here. Maybe we should all be like President Bush and not read the papers so we don't get worn down either.  The obvious? The OBVIOUS!? Since when did killing our enemies abroad not do anything but reduce the amounts of our enemies everywhere? DOWD seems to think that terrorists just pop out of the ground or fall out of trees when shook by the touch of America. Much as the popular myth about the origins of pharmaceuticals, this legend is false. We aren't in Iraq just to kill terrorists, we are aiming a dagger at the very heart of the problem: the Islamic culture. Once they become like the rest of the world the problem will be solved. I want them to be defeated by us, not the other way around. DOWD and her cronies and accomplices seem to favor our defeat if it would hurt Bush. That is almost treasonous.  I love the last jab about not reading the papers. Why should he since it is all the same inane ball all the time? Most people don't read newspapers because they aren't important. And why should the Leader of the Free World waste time with a sycophant like ball? I have nothing better to do, but the President of the United States has a war to win.
