           The Top Ten Conservative Idiots, No. 133 - Democratic Underground   Take a look at #3 on the list. I used to despise Zell Miller, but now I see him in a new light. My dislike was unfounded and based only on prejudice. My newfound respect and admiration resulted from learning of his voting record, and his public utterances on issues. He is the kind of Democrat that used to make up the party.   If Zell Miller was the average Democrat, I would be one myself. As I've said before on this webpage, I favor a great many "liberal" positions. I do want to change the world, to make things better. I don't like the idea of "conservatism" because it limits us to what has gone before. Admittedly this can be better than the socialism the Left envisions. But many of the traditions and conservative positions are simply outmoded and in need of reconsideration. For example, the War on Drugs.  I will vote for Bush in 2004 alongside Zell Miller. President Bush is simply the only man I can envision leading our country in this current test of strength. Don't be fooled by any Leftist pied pipers. We are in a war for our culture, our dominance must be maintained. Inclusiveness is just another word for submission. Why include unless they are equal or superior? We are right to try to stamp out the strict observance of Islam. Which, in case you didn't know, says all us infidels should be murdered.   The future will either be permanent conflict with Islam, a change in the religion, or its total domination of the earth. I know which future I want to live in. So does the President. The Democrats, with the exception of Zell Miller, do not.
