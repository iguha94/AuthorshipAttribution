           Choices for Election Day   This is just too funny.  The NY Times has come out with its list of endorsements for today's local elections in NYC.  Take a good look at the affiliated parties.  WFP?  What is the WFP?  Turns out it is the Working Families Party.  http://www.workingfamiliesparty.org/  Now I must cut and paste what this party stands for:  To create job growth, family-supporting wages and an economic recovery that benefits New Yorkers at all income levels, we support an economic program: that creates a living wage for all New Yorkers; supports the right of all workers to unionize; provides New Yorkâ€™s children with access to quality child care, education, health care, and housing; and develops our economy in an environmentally sustainable way.  All Americans should have universal access to quality, affordable health care, not as a privilege, but as a right. We support a single payer health care system that provides universal coverage and quality medical care. We also oppose privatization of health care delivery and coverage. Our health care system should be structured to provide the health care people need, rather than to provide profits to private corporations.   Our political system has become dominated by corporate special interests and political bosses. The result: a corrupt electoral system, weak labor unions, and economic policies that have increased inequality, lowered our living standards, and degraded our environment. The Working Families Party is being formed to provide a political voice for working New Yorkers. The Working Families Party will voice our concerns and address our aspirations. It will stand for economic justice and an economy that works for all of us. It will be accountable to ordinary New Yorkers, not to corporate contributors or party bosses. It will pursue fairness, opportunity, and prosperity for all New Yorkers.  Me:  Can there be any doubt as to the agenda of the "Newspaper of Record"?
