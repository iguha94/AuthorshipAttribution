         People, please watch Dennis Miller.  He's smoothing out the wrinkles and the program is working.  Aside from some good political comments, it's funny.  Last night when he was doing the news he had a monkey sitting on the desk with a button, whenever the monkey hit the button the Dean Scream played.  Hilarious.    Some other tidbits:  When Naomi Wolfe was complaining about Bush sending troops to be killed, Dennis asked her if she thought that didn't upset Bush at all.  Isn't Bush a human too?  Don't you think that those troops being killed doesn't tear him up?  Of course she had no comeback.  The other was his take on the BUSH LIED thing.  He said, I don't think it was malicious.  Bush had what he has to consider solid data from intelligence, then made a decision.  If the evidence was wrong, it was wrong, but not in a malicious cover up way.    He had an oppurtunity to trap a guy from Newsweek who was going on and on about BUSH LIED, in one tirad the man said that Bush tricked America into going into the war with Iraq, that they weren't the threat that Bush played it out.  But then later he railed that the intelligence community does not have the resources to protect us from the "threat of Al-Qeada and Iraq".  In one sentence Iraq is not a threat, yet we need to be better protected against the non-threat?  Clearly trying to have it both ways, I'm surprised Miller didn't jump on it.  Anyway, in short, try to catch it, it's turning into a great program for alternative media views.
