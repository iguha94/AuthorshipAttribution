           Bush&#8217;s U.N. fiasco   I read the Bush address word for word on-line, and I don't understand where Fred Kaplan is coming from.  I suspect the real issue with the left is that Bush didn't get down on his knees and cry for forgiveness.    We did the right thing in Iraq.  We are still doing the right thing, and the situation is far from the description we get from the media outlets.  A second democrat congressman has wrote a piece similar to the piece I linked the other day.  Gallup released a poll today taken in Iraq that mirrored the Zogby poll of last week.  Iraq is getting better, one step at a time.  As for this idea that the only answer is a UN answer, I simply don't understand.  How can a 'solution' drawn up by a large group that do not share a common interest be better than a focused effort to pacify Iraq?  The coalition one objective, primarily - turn Iraq into a free nation that does not threaten the world.  The UN has little interest in building a free nation.  Look at the membership of the UN!  Over half of the member states do not have representative government.  At least a third are open dictatorships.  How are these people any better than us when it comes to erecting a free government in Iraq?  George Will had the best line - "The UN Security Council is a World War II victory parade frozen in time."  It is quickly becoming irrelevant.
