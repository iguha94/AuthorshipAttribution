           Teller's World - Cheapening the Legacy   So, what have we here in the NYT? They are eulogizing the man who conceived the hydrogen bomb. Since it is the NYT, you can bet they made him out to be a villain. But if you use even their own list of his accomplishments, he comes out a visionary. He pioneered the hydrogen bomb, he helped found Livermore Laboratory, and he pushed Ronald Reagan towards missile defense.   The chief complaint the Leftists have against Teller's legacy is that he wanted to make better and more effective weapons. This cuts to the heart of one of the Left's biggest misconceptions: The idea that weapons are inherently evil and that better weapons should never be developed.  They forget or ignore that we are living in a world governed by the use of force, and that America would never attack another country without provocation. The Hydrogen bomb is a weapon so effective that it need never be used. The mere threat of its use was enough to ensure peace between great powers ever since it was developed. The culmination of human endeavor in weapons research seems to be to make weapons unusable. This is only true of course for rational human beings. The Islamic terrorists would not hesitate to risk all to kill innocent people.  I salute Dr. Teller and am glad he lived. His contribution to the world will be derided and criticized by those who do not know how their freedoms are protected. We are all grateful for the hydrogen bomb, but some of us do not realize it.
