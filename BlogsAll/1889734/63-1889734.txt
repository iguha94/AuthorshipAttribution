           OpinionJournal - Featured Article   The Wall Street Journal speaks about the Rush Drug story.  I haven't said much about this myself since there hasn't been any news about it.  At first, it was the National Inquirer, which seemed sordid and typical of a rag like that.  Then there was a New York Post story, claiming independent confirmation from the Palm Beach DA.  That is more convincing.  Rush himself mentioned it only briefly on his show Friday, and as the Wall Street Journal says, it makes sense for him to restrain comment when facing a legal issue.  Silence is the correct reponse, when there is really nothing forthcoming from a law enforcement agency that warrents a response.  Personally, this story angers me.  I am trying to be patient and not jump to conclusions, but the more I think that Rush might have done something this stupid, the angrier I get at him.  Of course, this story has not, nor likely will it, invalidate the fact that I agree with 90% of everything he has said about politics and the state of the American culture.    However, if there is truth to this, and my worse fears are confirmed (petty drug dealing, addiction, and the arrogance of thought displayed by such brazen behavior), then my future as a fan of Rush is in doubt.  I can forgive him to a point, but I will most likely abandon his show, even if I still agree with his positions.  Twelve years of listening have taught me to trust him.  This is the edge to the problem.  That trust has earned him the time and patience that will allow the truth to come out for me.  That trust is always the element that will shatter my connection to him if it turns out to be a bad truth.  Say it ain't so, Rush....
