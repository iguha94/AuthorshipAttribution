         An email from my brother, Mark.  It seems he is a little angry about the Dicky Roberts Slip n' Slide issue.   Slip 'N Slide sues Dicky Roberts producers.  The brunt of the argument is that the depiction of the incorrect way to "Slip 'N Slide" will endorse copycats incidents which will lead to lawsuits against Wham-O.  This is because some drunk idiot paralyzed himself on one in Wisconsin and got 12 odd million bucks.  So, it's gotten to the point where a ridiculous lawsuit is needed to show due diligence to protect against POTENTIAL ridiculous law suits.  OUTSTANDING!  I think civil suits should all be bench trials.  There is too much human emotion.  You have 12 average Joe's slugging it through life with 250 lottery tickets in their collective wallets getting a "feel good" rush by playing Santa Claus and Savior to some dumb schlep who spills coffee on their junk.  It's almost a victimless crime, what faceless corporation couldn't spare 12 mil to the kid who didn't read the directions on the glue gun?  Or is it that every juror sitting there thinks in the back of their mind, gee, maybe someday it will be me, and I'll be lucky enough to lose an eye to a champagne cork?  Then again, maybe we shouldn't complain too much, the "Get Rich Quick" lust has been engraved in the American Pysche since it's inherent implication upon the founding of our country.  I know one thing, screw the 9-5, I'm getting a six pack and looking for someone dumb enough to leave the cover off of the pool.
