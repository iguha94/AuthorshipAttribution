           Mars Missions History and Present and Future Missions - Mars Exploration Rovers | Mars TV Presents Return to Mars 2003 - 2004 | Mars Exploration Rovers - Mars Express - Beagle 2 | SpaceRef - Space News As It Happens   I was up on Saturday night watching the landing of Opportunity live.  It was simply amazing to hear what was going on at the JPL control room as the lander executed its programming without a flaw.  The controller would watch the clock and say "Parachute should be deployed" and then before he could finish his sentence, the confirmation tone came from the spacecraft.  Each step, from the firing of the retros, to the ground radar, to the airbag inflation, is all went perfectly.  It really amazed me that as the thing was bouncing around, it still had communication with earth and was telling us each time it bounced.    It filled me with pride.  This is the fifth time we've landed a functioning raft on Mars.  The total number of succesful times anything has landed on Mars?  Five.  This page gives a complete list of all Mars missions through history.  We've had our own share of failures, but we are the only people to get the job done.  The Russians have 16 failed missions to thier name.  The Martian surface is littered with crashed Russian landers.  If we ever do find evidence of technology on Mars, we should take a moment to check for the Hammer and Sickle on the wreckage.  And not only are we able to do this, we decided to go ahead and land two of them in the same month!    Despite the problems with Spirit, our success blinds us to the magnitude of what we have done.  This is America at it's best, and all the more reason we need to embrace Big Things.  Who else can do it at this moment in time?
