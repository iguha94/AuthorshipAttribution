           Democratic Underground Forums - GDP up 7.2%, we are toast   The denizens of the Democratic Underground greet the news of our raging GDP numbers announced today.  "Sure, I believe these numbers.  Just like I believed that Iraq had WMD. Just like I believed that the 2 taxcuts would create jobs. Just like I believe he won the 2000 election.  Sorry, but if this were truely the case, I think it's solely in the province of the 1% who had $5TT delivered back to them by Dimson. He distorts or kills all data coming from every Department in the federal government, so why would I believe this? A real 7.2% bounce would have this economy raging...that ain't happening."  More -   They ARE getting desperate, but that is only pushing them more swiftly to Totalitarian Heights that were coming anyway.  Yes, comrade, and Toilet Paper Production went up 600% last year.  Even if this number is remotely true and not to be "corrected downward" in a month with no publicity thus remaing in the Public Mind, then it is based on stolen loot from Iraq, stolen loot from the Amerikan Imperial Taxpayer, and the fact that the Busheviks have been increasingly ratcheting up their use of governmental agencies as political platforms.  Just like the Old Soviet Union.  With each year that passes, the Busheviks get closer to that Perfect Soviet 100% lie.  To me, this Soviet-style number indicates that, due to increased desperation and the fact that people are seeing through their old lies, the Busheviks are taking the lies to another level.  I warn you, they are not done ratcheting up and, should the Imperial Family remain in power for decades, we WILL reach that perfect Soviet media atmosphere the Busheviks so admire and desire.  No filters then, just Comrade Bushevik's Unadulterated Truths.
