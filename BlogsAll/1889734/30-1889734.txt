           Europeans said eating like Americans   See how superior the American way of life is? Even the snotty EUniks are eating our crappy fast food!   I have to bring up the Atkins lifestyle as the One True Path to normal weight. Don't be fooled by any imitators, like the South Beach diet. This lifestyle shift is hard at first, but it is neither dangerous or expensive. But it is not for everyone, as it does take a force of will that too few people are capable of.   When you see yourself in the mirror and realize that you didn't always look this way, that you want to look better, you must decide THEN to do something about it. One day I woke up, looked in the mirror, and decided that I was fat. I knew it was because of what I put in my mouth. So I changed. Months later I am 25lbs lighter and feeling better than I ever have before. Sure, I miss all the sugar and breads I used to eat. But I know better than to go down that path again. All it took was willpower. Why aren't you thin? Because you are weak. It's that simple. Make a decision today to stop your destructive behavior and start living as your body was meant to.  Email me if you have any concerns, or need a pep talk. I really do want everyone to eat this way. It works, and that's all that matters in the end.
