           CNN.com - Pentagon audit eyes Halliburton - Dec. 12, 2003   Okay, here is the Halliburton overcharging scandal.  Quote "The Pentagon said Thursday a routine review turned up the potential overcharge by subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root, which was awarded a no-bid contract in March to rebuild Iraq's oil industry.   But there is no allegation that Halliburton unduly profited from the overpriced gas.   The audit questions if Halliburton paid above-market rates to a Kuwaiti subcontractor when it paid $2.27 per gallon for the gas. Another supplier bought gas at $1.18 per gallon from Turkey.   Halliburton says the higher cost was due to having to negotiate a short-term contract, at a time when there weren't enough trucks in Kuwait to deliver the fuel. It says trucks had to be brought in and shipping in a war zone pushed up the transportation and security costs as well.   End Quote.  The story goes on to say that the government could simply refuse the bill, leaving the Subsidiary holding the bag.  Sounds like it is just a pricing dispute, which happens all the time in the business world.  Rational people will wait for the facts.  But that doesn't stop the irrational Left.  Quote "Democratic presidential candidates are already jumping on the issue.   Howard Dean called Halliburton "a special interest contributor that is overcharging taxpayers" and Dick Gephardt charged that Cheney's former employer is "bilking the taxpayers."
