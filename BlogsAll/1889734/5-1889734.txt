         I think I just need to give Don posting privilege on the Blog.  His emails are always fun.  Email starts. One more thing. Did you here the latest death toll from the European heat  wave? 19,000. And 11,000 in France. You made a comment on how expensive  their energy cost are over there and I wonder if that really had a hand in  so many deaths. Also I guess in Europe August is  holiday month for a lot of  doctors, but to let 19,000 folks die due to a shortage of docs seems  ridicules. From what I have read on the subject the French are once again  being criticize for their slow reaction to a crisis. Lets make a list: WWI,  WWII, Southeast Asia, and the current crisis over in Iraq. Had the French  reacted a little faster or reacted at all in both WWI and WWII things may  have been a bit different. And time will tell if they would have been a  factor at all in Iraq. The only thing the French are quick to react to is  the critisism of G. W. Bush, the U.S.A. and bad wine. Have 19,000 people  died yet in the war against Iraq? How many had Saddam killed? Maybe if the  U.S. had the French support nobody would have died. Thats a pretty strong  statement on a second rate socialistic country. But like I said time will  tell.  End Email.  Viva le France!  Haugh haugh haugh!
