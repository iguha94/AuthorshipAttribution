         It didn't take Don long to respond to my 'pro-nuke' commentary.  Here is his reply.  I don't have time right this minute to go into it, but I will as soon as I get back from a meeting.  Email starts  Wow Todd, that's some strong shit your talking. I don't know how to respond  to that. Its to bad the world hates us for getting into others affairs.  Maybe we should of had a "Prime Directive" and not interfere unless asked or  not at all. I don't agree with what you say. I don't think we should act alone. Let the  world deal with it. It never happened during the cold war whose to say it  will happen now. 9/11 or not. Can we really just go in and kill people and  say "Well, you might have attacked us" Why not try to be friends instead of  the aggressor. I don't know Todd but that first strike talk just sounds  crazy. Can you justify killing somebody because of something they might do.  Sounds like Minority Report. Then we should have nuked the USSR but they  would have done the same to us. So nuke the small guy back to the stone age  and then say "I'm sorry we had to do that. Sorry thousands had to die Here  take your country back and don't do it again But we'll help rebuild what we  destroyed. Friends?" I know this is not much of a response but it just sounds crazy.  End Email  Thanks for replying, Don.
