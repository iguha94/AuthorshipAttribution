           Rush Limbaugh Statement on Prescription Pain Medication Stories   I have to weigh in on this. I agree completely with Rush and the way he has handled this. Addiction to pain medication is very real and an extremely easy trap to fall into. I think that Rush isn't addicted to booze or cigarettes or many of the more common vices because he refuses to submit to them. But pain medication quickly becomes essential to one's well-being. It's similar to heroin in its building of somatic dependance.  I don't feel anger or really much of anything but sympathy towards Rush for his problem. I don't despise him for it, nor do I find his struggle with it to be noble. I am very glad to hear him say "I take full responsibility for the problem." This may be in fact one of the reasons he resigned from ESPN. Maybe now he can do what must be done in peace. I wish him the best of luck.  On the toher hand, I will despise him if he turned to illegal means to fuel his addiction. Let's face it, he should have had no problem in getting painkillers perscribed. To use his housekeeper is just plain stupid and seems inconsistent with his behavior. I certainly hope that once the truth comes out that "the stories you have read and heard contain inaccuracies and distortions, which I will clear up when I am free to speak about them."
