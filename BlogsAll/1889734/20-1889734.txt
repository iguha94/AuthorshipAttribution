           FOXNews.com - Top Stories - U.S. Forces Kill Eight Iraqi Cops As we enter the third year of World War IV, more evidence that the fighting is not over.  While this incident is a tragedy for the Iraqis, friendly fire happens all of the time in war, and we should not view this as a sign of incompetence, as surely the NYT will claim.  It simply isn't a safe place there, and it's going to take more time and lives to get the job done.  I was scanning the networks last night, and I noted that there wasn't a single 9/11 related show on!  Just the usual Sitcoms, and those were even re-runs.  Why couldn't we take at least an hour and have some sort of program on the Attack?  I had to go to the History channel to find anything.  I watched the Towers fall again, and it sharpened my belief that we are doing the right thing overseas.  Somebody should have replayed the entire morning 'as it happened' minute by minute just so we can remember what is was like.  They should do that at least every six months.  When is the last time you saw the planes hit, or the collapse?  I do't want to wallow in grief, but I think it is important to remember what we are doing and why we are doing it.
