         Don Barda took time out to watch Battlestar Galactica.  I am pleased to think he did so at my urging, so if that is not the case, don't tell me, Don.  Here are his comments:  Love it. What a great mini-series. I like how Boomer and Starbuck are women, the relationships. The decisions to let people die the emotions between  father and son. Baltar rocks, his unwittingly helping the Cylons was a great twist from the original. The galactica bring a museum ship was kinda corny but nothing is perfect. I do miss the brown leather jackets those were cool (always wanted one).  If this becomes a series which it sounds like it will I hope they breing back the motorcycles from when the reached earth. I had no expectations  about the series, never checked out any websites, but other SciFi movies were pretty disapointing like, shit what was it Children of Dune that  sucked. I'm enjoying this very much. I think the comercials over so later for now. Oh by the way finished shogun great read try it.   End email.  I didn't watch part II last night, since I was taping 24 and Diane was watching 24 upstairs.  I taped the 11 PM showing and will watch it tonight with no distractions.  I'm really looking forward to this, and I hope they didn't disappoint me.  And glad to hear you finished Shogun.  What's next?  Has anyone seen The Last Samauri yet?
