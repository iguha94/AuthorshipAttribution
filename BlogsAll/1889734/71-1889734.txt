         What is the Matrix?  Unfortunately, it turned out to be a steaming pile of waste matter.  I canâ€™t stand it anymore.  This post will be a confirmation that I have no life, other than sitting around and analyzing movies in excruciating detail.  Some of you get passionate about football or hockey, I get passionate about the Matrix, but only because of what I saw in it.    I have dreamed a dream, and now that dream has been taken from me.  The original Matrix, which Iâ€™m assuming most of you have seen, was a very entertaining, smart film that introduced some fascinating ideas.  While these ideas are not new, mostly being derived from Platoâ€™s work The Cave, the treatment was handled well.  We got some great action sequences, with enough mystery to suggest there was a lot more going on.  I was content with that, and looked forward to the next films, but not with the sort of anticipation that made it an obsession.  Not until a week or so before Reloaded opened.  At that point, I started to think about what they would do with the story.  Where would they go?  I operated off of an assumption â€“ The Wachowski Brothers (henceforth referred to as the Ws) were indeed intelligent, consistent film makers and story tellers, and the small flaws and problems in the Original movie had to exist for a reason.  The flaws were far too easy to fix, so I couldnâ€™t imagine them being simple mistakes.  Take the concept that humans are just a source of energy.  If the machines needed us for energy, why go through all the trouble of keeping us awake, or serving us a reality in which to live?  Why not just remove most of our higher brain functions and plug us in?  Why not use cows, or sheep, or some other organism that would produce the required heat?  It seemed a silly need, so I assumed it was a lie.  Also, when Neo is ejected from his Pod, why wouldnâ€™t the machines investigate why Neo woke up?  Why just kick him out and flush him, allowing him to be recovered by Morpheus and crew?  There was something more going on.  And Zion.  Surely it would take very little resources for the Machines to do away with Zion.  There had to be a reason it was allowed to exist.  Those type of problems led me to think there was something more going on.  The night before it opened, Mike and I spoke through instant messenger for nearly three hours, exploring the logical answers to those problems.  I still have that chat file saved, as evidence of our thoughts.  Our conversation ranged over many possibilities, but here is where we ended up.  The battery explanation could not be correct.  I felt that humans were needed to provide something the machines needed from us.  Perhaps they needed our neural matter to support their processing, or perhaps we supplied the emotional and creative impulse that they could not manufacture.  They lacked a â€˜soulâ€™, so they bottled us and tapped into ours.  We were integral to the machine existence, and because they went through such great lengths to keep us alive, and to stimulate our minds, we had to provide something more tangible than waste heat.  So why did they allow Neo and the others to be freed from their pods?  Why allow Zion?  I thought that the machine was actually feeding off of the emotional struggle of the Zionists against the Machine.  The rebellion was a source of energy, and by letting the Zionist think that they actually could fight the machine, the machine was drawing power from the human passion for resistance.  This led us to believe that Zion was not real, and no one was really free.  They were all still jacked into the system, and it was a game of deception.    Further exploration suggested that if Neo was the key, then there was a good chance he was not real.  Or at least not human.  The legend of the One stimulated a more passionate resistance.  He was the hope the humans needed to think they could really resist.  There was also speculation that Trinity and Morpheus were not real either, but that was less firm.  All of these things suggest complex, rich story lines that would blow away the original Matrix, and reveal it all as a lie.  And Matrix: Reloaded confirmed our thoughts.  Almost everything we speculated turned out to be true.  And there were even more hints that the story was even richer than we imagined.  If you have not seen Reloaded, Iâ€™m going to provide spoilers.  But really, it doesnâ€™t matter, because Revolutions cast it all away.    Reloaded revealed so many things.  It is difficult to know where to start.  The beauty of the movie is that nothing concrete is actually said.  We have long passages of richly complex dialogue, and if you have not peered deeper into the story, it seems to say nothing.  If you considered the small problems of the original, the dialogue is a rich reward for your efforts.  Suggestions are made that fit with our thoughts.  Hints expand on what we think is true, pulling the curtain back a little more each time.    We are caught up in the struggle between Zion and the Machine, but we start to sense that something isnâ€™t right.  The Oracle, once seen as a helper of the humans, darkly hints that things are going to end soon.  But in her speech, she suggests that Neo is indeed something other than a human, and talks about the ultimate need for all programs to have Purpose.  All things that exist have Purpose, and I extend that to the existence of Zion.  There is a reason for it all.  She tells Neo of the existence of someone called the Merovingian, and he needs to see this man.  The Merovingian has something that Neo will need, a program called the Keymaker.  The Keymaker is, pardon meâ€¦.â€™keyâ€™ to Neo getting where he needs to be.  About this time, Agent Smith shows up.  If you recall, Smith was â€˜destroyedâ€™ by Neo at the end of the first movie, when Neo went inside Smith and blew him apart.  Agent Smith has changed.  He is now his own man.  And he has the ability to create copied of himself by taking over other â€˜peopleâ€™ in the Matrix.  In a wonderful little speech, he reveals more of what is going on.    Smith: Surprised to see me? Neo: No. Smith: Then you're aware of it. Neo: Of what? Smith: Our connection. I don't fully understand how it happened. Perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me, something overwritten or copied. That is at this point irrelevant, what matters is that whatever happened, happened for a reason. Neo: And what reason is that? Smith: I killed you, Mister Anderson, I watched you die... With a certain satisfaction, I might add, and then something happened. Something that I knew was impossible, but it happened anyway. You destroyed me, Mister Anderson. Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do but I didn't. I couldn't. I was compelled to stay, compelled to disobey. And now here I stand because of you, Mister Anderson, because of you I'm no longer an agent of the system, because of you I've changed - I'm unplugged - a new man, so to speak, like you, apparently free. Neo: Congratulations. Smith: Thank you. But as you well know, appearances can be deceiving, which brings me back to the reason why we're here. We're not here because we're free, we're here because we're not free. There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose - because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist. Smith 2: It is purpose that created us, Smith 3: Purpose that connects us, Smith 4: Purpose that pulls us, Smith 5: That guides us, Smith 6: That drives us, Smith 7: It is purpose that defines, Smith 8: Purpose that binds us. Smith: We're here because of you, Mister Anderson, we're here to take from you what you tried to take from us. Purpose.  Smithâ€™s key line - We're not here because we're free, we're here because we're not free.  It reveals more of the truth of reality.  Smith has been seeking Zion in the first movie, and now he knows the truth.  Zion is not real either, and he has no escape from the system.  His Purpose was to find Zion, but there is nothing to find.  Later, they go to see the Merovingian, to try to get the Keymaker.  The Merovingian happens to be French, which is pretty amusing.  Oh, if you look up Merovingian, you find it is a nobility title, referring to the first founder of a line of Dukes.    Merovingian: Aha, here he is at last. Neo, the One himself, right? And the legendary Morpheus. And Trinity of course, si belle qu'elle me fait souffrir. [Trans: so beautiful she makes me suffer.] I have heard so much, you honour me. Please, sit, join us. This is my wife, Persephone. Something to eat? Drink? Hmm... of course, such things are contrivances like so much here. For the sake of appearances. Neo: No, thank you. Merovingian: Yes, of course, who has time? Who has time? But then if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time? ChÃ¢teau Haut-Brion 1959, magnificent wine, I love French wine, like I love the French language. I have sampled every language, French is my favourite - fantastic language, especially to curse with. Nom de Dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperie de connard d'enculÃ© de ta mÃ¨re! [Trans: Name of God of whore of brothel of shit of filth of jerk of fucking your mother up the ass.] You see, it's like wiping your arse with silk, I love it. Morpheus: You know why we are here.  Merovingian: Hmph... I am a trafficker of information, I know everything I can. The question is, do you know why you are here? Morpheus: We are looking for the Keymaker.  Merovingian: Oh yes, it is true. The Keymaker, of course. But this is not a reason, this is not a `why.' The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is means, it is not an end, and so, to look for him is to be looking for a means to do... what? Neo: You know the answer to that question. Merovingian: But do you? You think you do but you do not. You are here because you were sent here, you were told to come here and you obeyed. [Laughs] It is, of course, the way of all things. You see, there is only one constant, one universal, it is the only real truth: causality. Action. Reaction. Cause and effect. Morpheus: Everything begins with choice.  Merovingian: No. Wrong. Choice is an illusion, created between those with power, and those without. Look there, at that woman. My God, just look at her. Affecting everyone around her, so obvious, so bourgeois, so boring. But wait... Watch - you see, I have sent her dessert, a very special dessert. I wrote it myself. It starts so simply, each line of the program creating a new effect, just like poetry. First, a rush... heat... her heart flutters. You can see it, Neo, yes? She does not understand why - is it the wine? No. What is it then, what is the reason? And soon it does not matter, soon the why and the reason are gone, and all that matters is the feeling itself. This is the nature of the universe. We struggle against it, we fight to deny it, but it is of course pretense, it is a lie. Beneath our poised appearance, the truth is we are completely out of control. Causality. There is no escape from it, we are forever slaves to it. Our only hope, our only peace is to understand it, to understand the `why.' `Why' is what separates us from them, you from me. `Why' is the only real social power, without it you are powerless. And this is how you come to me, without `why,' without power. Another link in the chain. But fear not, since I have seen how good you are at following orders, I will tell you what to do next. Run back, and give the fortune teller this message: Her time is almost up. Now I have some real business to do, I will say adieu and goodbye. Neo: This isn't over. Merovingian: Oh yes, it is. The Keymaker is mine and I see no reason why I should give him up. No reason at all. Persephone: Where are you going? Merovingian: Please, ma chÃ©rie, I've told you, we are all victims of causality. I drink too much wine, I must take a piss. Cause and effect. Au revoir [Trans: Goodbye].  The key to the story is the battle between two different ways of being.  The machines are mired in causality.  They lack the understanding of intuitive choice that masters the human mind.  The Merovingian is part of the machine mentality, and sees all as deterministic.  Persephone, for her own reasons, decides to give Neo and company a chance to get the Keymaker.  She demands a price for helping Neo.  Neo must kiss her as if he was kissing Trinity.  He must make Persephone believe she is Trinity.  You can see her in this moment feasting on the power of Neoâ€™s passion, and to me it is another clue about what the machines need from us.  Oh, as we also see the worldâ€™s coolest urinal in this scene.  So they manage to get the Keymaker, after an amazing action sequence.  During the scene, the Merovingian refers to Neoâ€™s predecessors, meaning there have been other attempts at making the One, and indeed, the Merovingian himself is a former attempt at making the One.    And the final important sceneâ€¦.  Neo has been plagued with dreams of Trinity dying in the Matrix.  He asks her to stay out during the final sequence, and she agrees.  But a serious of improbably coincidences in the â€˜real worldâ€™ creates circumstances that force Trinity to enter the Matrix.  These coincidences, to me, are proof that the â€˜real worldâ€™ is under the influence of the machine, and is just another pocket inside the Matrix.  This takes place while Neo finally reaches the Architect, the creator of the Matrix.  Here is what takes place â€“   The Architect - Hello, Neo.  Neo - Who are you?  The Architect - I am the Architect. I created the matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also irrelevant.  Neo - Why am I here?  The Architect - Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden assiduously avoided, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.  Neo - You haven't answered my question.  The Architect - Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors: "Others? What others? How many? Answer me!"*  The Architect - The matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.  *Again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors: "Five versions? Three? I've been lied too. This is bullshit."*  Neo: There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.  The Architect - Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly's systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.  *Once again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors: "You can't control me! F*ck you! I'm going to kill you! You can't make me do anything!*  Neo - Choice. The problem is choice.  *The scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room*  The Architect - The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being, thus I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.  Neo - The Oracle.  The Architect - Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99.9% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked, would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.  Neo - This is about Zion.  The Architect - You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.  Neo - Bullshit.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors: "Bullshit!"*  The Architect - Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.  *Scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architects room.*  The Architect - The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals, 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.  Neo - You won't let it happen, you can't. You need human beings to survive.  The Architect - There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.  *The Architect presses a button on a pen that he is holding, and images of people from all over the matrix appear on the monitors*  The Architect - It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were by design based on a similar predication, a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the one. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis-a-vis, love.  *Images of Trinity fighting the agent from Neo's dream appear on the monitors*  Neo - Trinity.  The Architect - Apropos, she entered the matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.  Neo - No!  The Architect - Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning, and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to the left leads back to the matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you're going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic, and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple, and obvious truth: she is going to die, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.  *Neo walks to the door on his left*  The Architect - Humph. Hope, it is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.  Neo - If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.  The Architect - We won't.  And there we have it.  The Architect is the deterministic mind, and the One is a project to create an intuitive mind such as a human.  I read this as evidence that Neo is not really a true human.  He is a construct, but it is still important that he thinks of himself as human.  The One is designed to carry an affinity for humans, and to identify and act like one.  This is why it has failed many times.  The other incarnations of the One have â€˜gone nativeâ€™, just like the Merovingian.  They refused to embrace their purpose, and have diverged from the intended path.    There are many different ways to interpret what this all means.  The one I prefer is as follows: Zion is a place to store those that cannot accept the true nature of the Matrix.  They are placed there, out of the way, and the Machines allow them to believe they are fighting their little war.  In fact, the machines are providing the sort of reality that these rebellious types prefer.  So the â€˜epicâ€™ battle between man and machine is just another layer of deception, to keep them out of the way.  But this creates instability in the Matrix, and over time, it becomes too difficult to keep it all going.  So they wipe it clean and â€˜rebootâ€™.  Neo is actually being manipulated to enhance his affinity for the humans, and everything to this point has been a bit of a game to prod his natural evolution.  It is conceivable that Trinity is not real, she might be a construct designed for Neo to love.  Morpheus is an unwitting tool, serving the machine by stirring up the rebellion amongst the Zion humans.  He is doing the work of the machine by pumping Neo full of myth and legend.  And the Oracleâ€¦.what interest does she serve?  In the end, Agent Smith finds a way to manifest himself in the real world of Zion, and Neo suddenly is able to exercise his Matrix type powers in Zion.  Those two issues are never addressed in Reloaded, but what else can it mean??  If these abilities exist, then Zion can not be real!  It is proof that this is all a lie, but the movie ends there with the promise of Revolutions.  I cannot explain the angst, hatred, and devastation I experienced with Revolutions.  I could not wait for all of these truths to be revealed to us.  I wanted to see the moment when Morpheus realized his passionate lifeâ€™s dream was just another lie.  I wanted to see him break.  I wanted to see how Neo would react when he understood his purpose was to allow the machines to exist without humans.  Neoâ€™s ultimate purpose was to allow the disposal of humanity.  And I wanted to see that Smith, by opposing Neo and the Architect, really was the anti-heroâ€¦the man who would save humanity by bringing it all down.  Nothing was as it seemed, and there was so much promise of an ending the likes of which I have never seen in a Hollywood movie.  Alas, Revolutions was a great steaming pile of crap.  None of these wonderful ideas were explored.  We got our video game Independence Day happy ending.  No darkness, no false truth, just a shallow surface that satisfied no one.  But the most maddening thing of it all is the truth that is still buried.  There are plenty of subtle clues in Revolutions that all the things we have speculated are indeed true, but they present it in such a way as to hide all of this glorious truth in a bubble gum ending.  The Oracle and the Architect want the same thing â€“ stability in the Matrix.  The Oracle created Smith to oppose the Architect in his Neo project.  They disagree as to how to reach stability.  The Architect wants to control the humans, and to remove the source of their discontent through engineering.  The Oracle wants to simply discard the rebellious humans, cast them out of the Matrix by giving them their freedom.  Her intent was to make Zion so much trouble, the Architect gets fed up and tosses the humans out.  But her Smith creation got out of control and brought down the Matrix and threatened the existence of the machine.  So the Architect and the Oracle have to get together to protect themselves.  The Architect sacrifices his One project to take out Smith, and the Matrix is then reset.  As part of this bargain, the Architect finally agrees to free the humans who want to be free.    Unfortunately, we never see the true consequence of this act.  The fact that Zion is not real is never revealed.  Instead, we are treated to a CGI fest representing the Battle of Zion, but how can I care about such a thing when I know it doesnâ€™t really exist?  There is no consequence to the Battle, since the destruction of Zion means little in the grand scheme.  We are given the insipid happy ending demanded by the lowest common denominator of movie going audiences.  They get their shallow meaningless ending, while the truth is hidden in such a way, it might as well not be there.  Certainly, there are clues to all I have inferred, but why hide it?  Why cloak such a wonderful story behind this garbage??  Here is the ending I would have preferred.  Trinity dies, as she did in the movie.  Neo confronts the AI about his nature, and discovers that he is not real, and this has all been a project to make humans obsolete.  But he finds hope that he can still be a service to the humans he has grown to love.  Trinity is gone, he has nothing to live for, but he can still help in one last act.  He agrees to take out Smith, to save the machines, but the Zion humans must be shown the truth and given a choice.  They can be cast out in the actual, truly real world, to try to live an impossible existence on a blasted planet, or they can return to the Matrix and be imprinted with the personality that can accept the Matrix, the code held inside of Neo because of his hybrid nature.  He will complete the One project, but humans must be allowed to be free.  In a sense, he sides with the Oracle in the preferred solution.  We see the Battle of Zion freeze in mid-action, with some crazy bullet time camera work looking at the frozen tableau from many angles.  Then it all dissolves into Matrix codeâ€¦leaving the humans imprisoned in the white room of the construct.  A bare existence for the moment.  The battle for Zion did not matter, since it was all just an exercise to motivate Neo, to drive his empathy and affinity, to make him more like a human.  Other than that, it served no real purpose since the Zion humans were never free anyway.  Neo takes out Smith, just as he did in the movie, and is destroyed and absorbed back into the machineâ€¦his code disseminated.    The Architect speaks to the humans in Zion and tells him of Neoâ€™s choice.  He shows them the true reality on the outside, and gives them time to decide which they prefer.  We see Morpheus, a shattered man, confronting the truth that his entire purpose, his entire life, was a lie.  Morpheus makes his choice.    In the closing scene, we see Morpheus, in a suit and tie, sitting in a massive room filled with cubicles, doing some mindless task.  He canâ€™t seem to figure out why his life doesnâ€™t feel right.  We see the despair in his eyes as he struggles to remember something that he just canâ€™t seem to put a finger on.  All he knows is that this isnâ€™t right.  As he said in the original, â€œIt is like a splinter in your mind.â€  And that could have been a magnificent ending.  At least in my mind.  Instead, we get one of the worst films ever made.  And the real pain lies in what it COULD have been.  Thanks for sticking with this.  I had to get it out of me, because it hurts.
