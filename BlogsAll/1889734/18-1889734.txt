           Exploiting the Atrocity   A Krugman morning.  The sun is shining and the birds are singing.  Paul just doesn't get it!    ...in the past six weeks President Bush has invoked 9/11 not just to defend Iraq policy and argue for oil drilling in the Arctic, but in response to questions about tax cuts, unemployment, budget deficits and even campaign finance.  End quote.  All of the items he referenced here DO have something to do with 9/11.  We need energyindependence, and ANWR is a start.  We need tax cuts to get the economy moving again.  I don't know what he talking about when he mentions Campaign Finance.  Let's look at the economy.  In the last year of Clinton, we started into a recession.  Then the following events came along in quick order.  9/11 Anthrax Plane crash on Long Island Afghan War Shoe bomber Enron/Arthur Anderson MCI Global Crossing Tycho Embassy Bombings Bali Nightclub Bombing Iraqi War Iraqi Occupation  And I'm sure I'm missing other terrible things like X Men 2 and Gigli.  We should be amazed that the economy isn't melting down.  Instead, the Dow is flirting with 10,000 again.  The deficits as a percentage of GDP are the lowest they have been in decades, despite the almost ludicrous numbers tossed about.  The Treasury coffers are diminished, but as the economy picks up, that problem will go away.  No country has ever taxed itself into prosperity!  Bah.  OKay, I'll leave it alone.  Krugman just gets me going!
