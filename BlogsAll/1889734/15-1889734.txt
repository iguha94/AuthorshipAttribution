           thetruereligion.org - A-Z of Islam   Don sent this link in, and I attached his comments.  Here is their message.... This is Islam A to Z. Found it interesting thought you would to. Not that I am a scholar of Islam now but it seems to me that the Qur'aan makes it easy to change what Allah wants or that anything that is not covered in the book is covered by the Sunnah or Muhammads (PBUH)sayings/traditions. I thought the whole concept was religion is for Allah alone. So why is a man connecting the dots? Know what I mean? And how does an illiterate man write the Qur'aan anyway?  I haven't spend a lot of time with it yet, but a quick glance reveals a determined effort to defend Islam as a Great Religion.  No surprise.  Perhaps back in its day, Islam was a Great Faith.  They preserved knowledge, protected religious minorities, and were an advanced civilization.  And then something happened to give us what we have today.    The link above claims religious tolerance, reverence for women, praise for Christians, and a tradition of science.  Fine.  So explain to me the widespread violence in the Muslim world?  Explain the backwardness of the Islamic culture?  Explain the human rights abuse?  I don't bring it up out of malice.  I need these answers.  I can't accept the above claims of greatness when the examples run counter to the statements.
