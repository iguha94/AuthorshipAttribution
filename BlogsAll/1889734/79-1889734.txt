           Op-Ed Columnist: The End of the West?  This Thomas Freidman guy might be a decent human being there at the Times.  I've believed since the late 90s that the EU will grow to be a primary threat to America, and I do not rule out the possibility of war at some point in the next 20-30 years.  Hard to believe we could ever go to war with Europe, after all we have been through together, but I still think it is possible.  The concentration of economic power in the EU is a fine thing, until that power is used contrary to our collective interest of security and stability.  France and Germany have both demonstrated a willingness to countervene our collective secruity goal through their financing and arming of Saddam in the face of UN sanctions.  France particularly has continued to pose the EU is a strategic 'counterweight' to American power in the world, meaning in plain language - they wish to oppose our positions to prevent us from maintaining our position as the lone superpower.  Hardly the stuff of honest disagreement over policy.    The EU will continue to grow, despite being mired in socialism.  At some point, they will become more competitive, and with that added power, they will continue to pursue their own aims.  As we continue to diverge in our collective goals, the opportunity for real conflict will continue to grow.  Ultimately, the first American-European War might be in the offing.
