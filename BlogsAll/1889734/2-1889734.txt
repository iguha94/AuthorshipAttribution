           OpinionJournal - Featured Article   I missed this one yesterday and Mike pointed it out.    I've been running into a lot of reports from soldiers coming home, or independent journalists, or even democratic Congressmen echoing the Secretary.  The situation in Iraq is going quite well, despite the wailing and moaning of the media.    I'm really starting to believe, as I watch poll numbers erode, that the media is playing with fire here.  We have been in Iraq for 6 months.  It took 6 years to pacify Japan, and fifteen years to completely reassemble Europe.  If we were in post WWII with this media climate, those areas of the world would still be in ruins, breeding hatred.    If the media manages to destroy our will to do what must be done, then we are in sorry shape for the future.  No problems will be addressed unless they can be solved in days, rather than months, and the lords at the New York Times will have a disproportionate amount of power.  The media serves a valuable end, and they should have the freedom to report news that does not conform to the party line of the government.  But this freedom comes with responsibility.  Fortunately, we have outfits like Fox News that are starting to get back to fair, open journalism.  Judging by their ratings, the public is hungry for news, not editorial.
