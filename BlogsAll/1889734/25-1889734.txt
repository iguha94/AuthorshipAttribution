           Casting A Cold Eye on Arctic Oil   This is a NYT editorial by one Nicholas Kristof. He went on a trip to the Arctic Wildlife Refuge to see first-hand what exactly would be "spoiled" by drilling for oil. He plays at being objective and tries to really consider the issue, but in the end he's just another environmentalist whacko. I will cite excerpts from his artice below, and my responses:  "Arctic oil can be chimerical, and it would be tragic to sacrifice this wilderness for a series of dry wells."  If the wells turn out to be unprofitable, won't the pullout by the oil industry return the area to a state of pristine beauty? Or will the mere presence of some buildings or some scaffolds or something ruin it for all time? I bet the animals would be glad to have some shelter made for them.   "It's also only fair to give special weight to the views of the only people who live in the coastal plain: the Inupiat Eskimos, who overwhelmingly favor drilling (they are poor now, and oil could make them millionaires). One of the Eskimos, Bert Akootchook, angrily told me that if environmentalists were so anxious about the Arctic, they should come here and clean up the petroleum that naturally seeps to the surface of the tundra."  "Drilling supporters also grossly understate the impact of drilling when they speak of only a 2,000-acre "footprint" in the Arctic. The reality is that oil would mean roads, lodgings, pipelines, security fences, guard stations and airstrips Ã¢â‚¬â€ and my children would never be able to experience the Arctic as I have. "  This illustrates the classic elitism of the whacko environmentalists. They want the emotional comfort of protecting something. The people who live with the useless crap that is protected are always in favor of exploiting it. What good is any resource until it is used? Kristof wants to keep this area a wasteland so his progeny can frolick there. MEanwhile, the people who live their and have some claim to the land live in poverty. They don't have a cushy NYC apartment to fly home to. Yet he wants to keep them poor just to soothe his ego. Is some tundra more important than improving people's lives? It is to Kristof.  What benefit is there to not drilling? It would maintain the pristine beauty of a marshy tundra so the elite can go and view it for a week.   Now, what are the benefits to bringing oil out of the ground? Jobs, wealth, and reduced dependance on hostile states for oil. All of this would magically appear out of the ground! What an awesome miracle! Leftisits would have us eschew such an enterprise so as to keep us dependant and poorer than we could be.  I suppose only third-world toilets like Saudi Arabia and Traq are fit to benefit from the wealth uner the ground. America doesn't want to tap into its own reserves. Those are for future generations and peoples to exploit. What right do those future generations have to deprive us of resources? Some one will pump this oil. It will be utilized. The benefits of doing it now are tremendous. There is no drawback. No one can make any rational argument against drilling. No one loses anything. A great many people benefit. We all would benefit.   Now that I have done with reason, I will return us to Kristof and his inane blatherings:  "True, we need to get our oil from somewhere, and Americans are dying now in Iraq because of our dependence on foreign oil. So I would endorse drilling in the Arctic refuge if it were part of a mega-environmental package that also addressed global warming, an environmental challenge where we have even more at stake than in the Arctic."  This is the tired "war for oil" message we've been hearing for a year. Apparently Kristof thinks that drilling is some sort of sacrifice that could be leveraged to force the US to pour money down the rathole of Global Warming. That is a subject for another post, but I will state here the absolute truth of Global Warming. There is no conclusive or even highly suggestive scientific data that GLobal Warming exists. It is a thinly veiled attempt to shackle the USA with restrictions on our way of life. If Global Warming did exist, who can say if it would not be beneficial?  "Yet President Bush's push to open the Arctic refuge is not part of such a bold and thoughtful package to break the stalemate on the environment. Rather it is simply a lunge for oil. Without trying to conserve oil, Mr. Bush would gobble up a national treasure, the birthright of our descendants, as a first resort."  Here I must lay out for you the thesis about resources from the Leftists: There is a finite supply of all resources, be they money, oil, or jobs. To increase one group's share is to reduce that of all other groups. Conservation of resources and proper management is the only way to ensure adequate supply for everyone.  This thesis is completely flawed. The idea that there is a finite supply of anything is bogus. Take oil for example. True, there is little new oil being created deep whithin the earth. But it is not true that no new sources are being discovered. The estimates of oil reserves are continually being revised, and for the better.   As an example of a pletiful resource being tightly regulated and conserved, consider diamonds. De Beers controlls the world's diamond supply. They decide how many diamonds to mine and sell. There is no shortage of diamonds. They are in fact extremely common. But this tight control by a single supplier has led to diamonds being expensive. If the market was suddenly given an ifusion of cheaper diamonds De Beers would have to expend great sums of money to buy up all the excess supply, or their monopoly would be finished. This has happened several times before, and De Beers has nearly gone broke because of it.   The moral of this story is that conservation does nothing but raise prices. Reducing consumption would essentially reduce supply, because there would be less incentive to pump oil out of the ground. Reduced demand would then lead to higher prices. The solution to any case of high demand is to increase supply. Drilling in Alaska would have the effect of reducing prices for oil pumped out of Saudi Arabia. Only the rulers of OPEC nations would benefit from our failure to exploit oil reserves in Alaska.   Kristof employs a weak and flimsy emotional argument as his conclusion. Rational people cannot listen to such an appeal with anything but pity and scorn.   "The argument that I find most compelling is that this primordial wilderness, a part of our national inheritance that is roughly the same as it was a thousand years ago, would be irretrievably lost if we drilled. The Bush administration's proposal to drill is therefore not just bad policy but also shameful, for it would casually rob our descendants forever of the chance to savor this magical coastal plain Ã¢â‚¬â€ and to be slapped in the butt by a frisky polar bear."  You would think the inhabitants of this "magical coastal plain" might be in the best position to tell us if it should be preserved or exploited. But apparently Kristof and those like him are the true inhabitants of the land. They are able to percieve its true beauty. Beauty that robs the current inhabitants of the chance to profit from something useless under their feet. The arrogance is astounding, and Kristof insults the Eskimos by saying they are not smart enough to preserve the beauty around them.
