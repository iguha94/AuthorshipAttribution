           New York Post Online Edition: entertainment   I guess Imus, a loser who sought out cocaine and alchahol as an escape from his failed life, is qualified to criticize Rush Limbaugh. Never mind that Rush became addicted to the pain medication as a result of unbearable spinal pain.  ""Suck it up, fatso, and stop taking 100 pills a day or whatever . . . and employ some discipline in your life," Imus said, while offering Limbaugh some recovery advice. "  "When an e-mailer suggested that Imus lay off the top-rated talker because of his own past experience with addiction, Imus said he's simply giving what he got.   "Everybody made fun of me - and still does," he said. "When I went to rehab, [Howard] Stern was hilarious."  Myabe Stern was hillarious, but Imus is just being cruel and vindictive. I'm sure he thinks that Imus should be king of talk, not Rush Limbaugh.   "Sean Hannity, the Fox News Channel personality whose own syndicated radio show follows Limbaugh's on WABC, said he wishes Limbaugh a speedy recovery - but he warned it won't be easy.   "I know the Rush critics out there - the 'those who want to see any conservative fall on their face' crowd - will probably meet the news with glee and joy and happiness," Hannity told his radio listeners.   "The real liberal compassion will show its true colors here," he said."  Indeed.
