           you only hide   ~something for kate~   so i keep watch and you keep breaking breaking formation to become someone else and your eyes become corridors where i wander with a candle calling out to you  and you only hide because you know i'll find you  you say you just want to feel the way you used to feel the way you should feel and i wander through the lost city of you  and you only hide because you know i'll find you   Reminds me very much of what I felt like last year. Just that I was the one hiding, wanting to be found. Sometimes, that is.    Something for Kate  has finally put the   lyrics  for all their songs back online. And I finally do not just have to guess and make up words from misheard lyrics. :). Joked about just that with Ev today, actually.  We chatted on the phone, and it was relationship comfort at it's best.  We're so happy and close these days, it's shocking. It's peaceful and comforting. What I miss most at the moment, is surrendering and granting him unlimited access to me. It sounds bizarre, really, saying it that way, but I just miss having someone touch me, for his and my pleasure. I miss being touched, and feeling so good that I can let him touch me whenever he wants it.  I miss that the most.  My mind is playing weird tricks with me these days because of a lack of touch, I guess. I can't get  several scenarios out of my head . What it's like to bury my face between his shoulder and neck and smell him. What having him in my mouth is like. What sleeping next to him is like. What he feels like next to me and what I feel like next to him.   I love this man, really. And I would so want to have him here with me right now.
