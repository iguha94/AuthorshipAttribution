         i finally managed to get my lazy bum to the gym again. hooray!  the gym hiatus was almost 5 weeks long. back then, i had a really good gym streak, several weeks of regular working out, but then came sickness, stress, heat, stress and more sickness. alas, all is well again. experience has shown that once i'm back in the habit, i stick to it.  i feel so much better again after two days of working out, it's quite miraculous.   friday  morning, i did my usual lower body weights training plus some 30 minutes of cross trainer. i would have preferred doing more, but due to time constraints (i had a shrink appointment that morning), i was in a bit of a rush. it was a good workout though. i enjoy the lower body set anyway, and it felt really good to feel those muscles working. all these weeks on non-working out had made me feel all wobbly (especially those large legs of mine), and the workout showed me quickly that there are muscles under there. hooray to that!   saturday  afternoon, i went to a bodystyling and bmw class run by andrea. as usual, her classes were a lot of fun, and highly taxing. no matter how much whining i do before going to the gym, or how much i try to talk myself out of going sometimes, once i am in front of the step in her class, it's all good, and i know i am there for a good reason. today, i am nicely sore all over, especially in the  legs and abs, as was to be expected. there wasn't any time for cardio saturday: the day was quite packed with other things and i'm happy i got time to do as much working out as i did. i thought about going to the gym today, but decided against it: i needed some relationship time. rushing off to the gym at 8:30 on a sunday kills that essential relationship. it was okay though, with all that soreness and such.  this week, i hope to get to the gym at least 4 times. on monday evening, i want to do some cardio and attend the first pump class in ages. pump is my fave workout of all times, and i miss it a lot. ever since my gym stopped offering pump in the mornings, i haven't been to a class, so i hope to change that tomorrow. tuesday morning, i should be doing my upper body weights, plus a step and abs class with andrea. wednesday, i hope to do lower body weights and spinning (wobbly legs galore!). thrusday/friday i should fit in some more cardio and weights. i'm going away on the weekend, to an ip seminar from uni, and don't know yet, whether i will leave on saturday or sunday. if it'll be sunday, i'll go to andreas bodystyling class saturday afternoon again. yeah: a week of workout fun is ahead! - it's all very much needed. my energy levels improve so much with working out, and i feel so much better about myself as well. considering that the ip seminar might very well include some swimming with fellow students, that's all needed, indeed..               </post>
