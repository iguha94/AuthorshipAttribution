         Just came home from the gym. Did three rounds in the weight circuit (even though I felt like bailing out after two, and had decided halfway through round two that I'd only do two rounds), which included 180 crunches. Not too shabs, me thinks.  Followed up with 60 minutes on the crosstrainer on low intensity, reading "Marie Claire" and "Men's Health", the latter being highly entertaining, as it is just as bad as the female equivalents. Especially enjoyed the sex tips, this month, men were allowed to learn that yes, masturbation is ok, what's necessary for a sex-filled weekend with a lover (a hotel room, a razor, a dildo, a tape recorder) and how to educate women about female ejaculation and queefs (as if women didn't know that already). Lovely. Finished with some stretching in the testoserone loaden part of the weight room. Oy. They should really move the stretch area somewhere else; I hate the mirrored corner where the mats are now.   Took a good long time to get ready afterwards, and that was fine and splendid, too.  Odd thing: While I am starting to see my image in the mirror more and more critically (my self-blaming and self-hating mechanisms are in full swing) and hopped on the stupid scale again today, it's quite bizarre that I isolate what I see from how I feel. Standing under the super nice and hot gym shower today, I enjoyed the way my bod feels, the firmness and softness and shapelyness. I wish I could transfer that feeling to looking at myself. Duh.  Anyway. That much for now. Gym again tomorrow. :)
