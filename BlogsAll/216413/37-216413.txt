         Not feeling to great today, don't know. Came suddenly.  It's still way too warm over here, even though we had tons of thunderstorms since last night. I actually woke up at abround 4am because it was so light in my room from the massive lightning. Very impressive. I was half asleep though, can't remember when and how I got up to close my balcony door...very odd.  Spend the morning chatting to Linnie for a while (and to Dan, too), before I ventured into town to get a ticket for tomorrow's train ride and some dead animals for Michel and me to throw on the Barbecue tonight at Tina's party. It shall be fun. I haven't decided on clothing yet, but considering the fact it's very tropical at the moment, I'll prolly go with a black shell top and jeans. Oh well, not that important. I will, however, get very very smashed tonight in a very short time frame - I do, after all, have to get up really early tomorrow, my train leaves at 7:55am. Yeah. Considering I need to pack some leftover things in the morn, I should get up...early. Hm. Anyway. Looking forward to going home, another day with all that hair on my head and I shall freak.  Not much more to say right now. Thanks to the thunderstorms, the scaffolding workers that were very noisy in the morn took off, and the painter's aren't there either. Sweet loneliness.  More later. Gotta call my boy now. We have a phone date, sort of.
