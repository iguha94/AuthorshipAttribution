         I was a lazy bum Monday and Tuesday and for the first time in a while didn't go to the gym at least every other day. Oh well. For some reason, I just couldn't pick myself up - had awfully sore muscles Monday (especially my latissimus and the sides of my thighs were hurting) and felt like crap on Tuesday morn (hormonally induced, I am sure) and had no time Tuesday night as i had to play plumber for Tina trying to get her kitchen waste pipe going again (was as successful as you can be without the right equipment - note: kids, yes, hot water removes wax. however, lots of wax stays stuck in the drain pipe and causes floods. so DON'T DO IT.).  Anyway. I finally dragged myself to Pump this morning, and had a great time, - managed to get through the dreaded lunges without cramps, crying, stopping and with more weight than before - am very proud of myself, indeed. Added weight to warm up, back, bi&triceps, lunges and shoulders, and it was all good. I am sure I'll feel it in my shoulders tomorrow.  Pump weigths: Warm Up:7kg / Legs (Squats):10kg / Chest:5kg / Back:9kg / Triceps 5kg & 2 1/2kg / Biceps:5kg / Legs (Lunges):5kg / Shoulders:4kg and 1kg each  Hopped on the scale, and weighed less than before, too. Yay. Finished up with 45 minutes on the crosstrainer. And felt good, if terribly hungry. Yup, had missed out on brekkie again. Silly me. Have to figure out what to do work out wise when at home over the weekend, would love to swim, but that ain't possible because of the new piercing, so I reckon I will try to hit the gym with Cordu, we'll see whether I'll have time for that at all anyway.
