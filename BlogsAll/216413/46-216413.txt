         For some odd reason, this little fact bit I read in Simon Garfield's  "Britain in the Time of AIDS"  really (yucky word alarm) "touches" me: During "The Party", a Safer Sex show at Wembley Arena back in April 1987,   Elton John  (who I really don't like very much, even though I admire the fact his   AIDS Foundation  has distributed over 20 million US$  between 1992 and 1999 to AIDS research & patient care worldwide) sang "Will you still love me tomorrow". And somehow this just says a lot about what it was like with AIDS in the 80's. And it somehow makes me sad. Very very sad.     will you still love me tomorrow?   ~the shirelles~  (1961)  tonight you're mine completely you give your love so sweetly tonight the light of love is in your eyes but will you love me tomorrow?  is this a lasting treasure or just a moment's pleasure? can i believe the magic of your sighs? will you still love me tomorrow?  tonight with words unspoken you say that i'm the only one but will my heart be broken when the night meets the morning sun?  i'd like to know that your love is love i can be sure of so tell me now, and i won't ask again will you still love me tomorrow? will you still love me tomorrow?
