         good morning at the gym: unexpected pump class!  started out with 60 minutes on the crosstrainer, reading men's health (their sex tips are just as bad as those in cosmopolitan) and burning 750 kcal. hooray.  the introduction class run by bettina turned out to be a normal pump class, just with a real warm up, with the music a tad bit slower and no clean and press in the back exercise section.   weights per side  warm up  3 1/2 kg legs (squats) 5 kg chest 3 1/2 kg back 4 1/2 kg (no clean & press) triceps 3 1/2 kg biceps 3 1/2 kg shoulders 2 1/2 kg legs (lunges) 3 1/2 kg  all very enjoyable, no pain, no soreness from yesterday. felt a bit odd though, because i was the one with the heaviest weights in that class. oy. all weights felt ok though - apart form the triceps one, maybe, but  then i've been wanting to up the weights for more impact. might up the weight for the squats. should decide on monday.  that aside, i enjoyed it, mainly because i enjoyed looking at me in the mirror, for a change. wore my purple top, and kept staring at my shoulders and arms, which *did* look good, i reckon, all muscluar and firm. i'll never be skinny-skinny, but firm and muscular, i can live with. :)  am still taking it a bit easier foodwise, btw, and that has been good, too. feel better, even though i still have major tummy trouble. hmph.
