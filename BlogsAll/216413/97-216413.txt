         Just as a quick update back from Condom dispensing duty: No questionnaire from Andre.  So he's not as creative as I thought he'd be. On another nore: Boy, does this chap have a lot to learn. A sex ed intern who isn't sure about where the cervix is? Hear me say puleeeeeeze. Thankfully Susan was quick to teaching him. Oh boy.   In any way, I had a fun morning, really, even though it made me realize how far away I (thankfully) am from teens now. Was all a bit bizarre: was I ever that bad and unbearable, too? I can't put my finger on it, really, on what it is that irritates me so much, the icky clothes, the sticky make-up or just the show-off thing the boys had. Ick.  Oh well, it was fun. Chatted with some of the other people there, which was interesting, and got the idea of writing an article for   Scarleteen  about   FLUSS , a queer sex-ed project here in Freiburg, aimed at high schools. Let's see what   Heather  says to my article idea and what the people who run the programm are like. The chap I talked to today, Alexander, was fab. And FLUSS's work surely sounds great.  I also scored another red plush condom with condom pouch (and lots more condom/sex-ed/HIV-prevention merchandise) from Ralf from   BZgA . One of the red plush condoms should make a great toy for the   world's best pug . Hmmm, let's see what she says- Won't send it off without something for her owner though, so it could be a few days before we can witness her reaction. Was a running ad for the crappy PP website again, too. Nice T-Shirt, dumb website. Too bad that I can't keep it. Oh well.
