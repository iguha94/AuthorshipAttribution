         i'm such a good girl gym wise, such a bad girl food wise.  monday, i went to the gym in the evening, and did a 60 minute pump class, followed by a 60 minute step class, both run by bettina. pump was good, even though it seemed rather "easy" somehow. guess i need to use more weight and concentrate on the muscles groups more.  step was fun. i usually hate step, but this was a good manageable choreography and a damn fine work out overall. pushed myself really hard and felt good directly after the class. however, by the time i got home and had finished talking to tina, who called as i walked in the door, i was absolutely exhausted, dehydrated, headachy, jittery and about to throw up. not good. forced myself to drink water and eat 4 rusks, because i couldn't manage anything else. went to be straight away, and was quite worried, falling asleep, that i'd throw up in my sleep. oy. thankfully, i woke up all rested and fine. need to be careful to eat and drink a little more before doing these hefty workouts.  today, i did three rounds of weight circuit, took part in a 45 minute step class and a 30 minute ab class, both run by sanne. doing the weight was good, even though i got all stressed out about being ready for the class on time (which worked out fine in the end). tried to concentrate on the muscles i was working again, which worked ok. could barely manageas many lower back exercises as planned - guess those muscles need some rest after yesterday's pump, even though i wasn't sore at all this morning. the 45 minute step class was quite taxing, mainly choreography wise, which involved plenty of turns and jumps and what have you. could have easily done 15 more minutes. the ab class was lovely & hard, just the right amount of difficulty. managed more full sit ups then everyone else. he.:)
