         today, i did 35 minutes on the cross trainer (on quite a high intensity, 510 kcal, yeah) and then joined a body pump class with julia.  bizzarely enough, none of the wednesday morning regulars turned up, so julia and i did the class all alone, just the two of us, which was lovely, of course. - the alternative would have been to do my upper body weights today, which i didn't exactly feel like.julia profited from it though, too: we tried out the new choreography for the first time. it worked ok, butr not perfectly, and so far, i must admit that i much prefer the previous one we had, both music and exercise wise. - but maybe that's just because this was the first time. know for sure that i will have to up the weights on some of these rounds, soon. felt worked out, but maybe not enough so. oh well, i'll see soon enough.   weights per side  warm up: 3 1/2 kg squats: 7 kg chest: 4 1/2 kg back: 5 kg triceps: 3 1/2 kg biceps: 3 1/2 shoulders: 2 1/2 and 2 1/2 for side lifts lunges: 6kg  i wore my matte light grey pants today, which was interesting. it's the most unflattering colour and cut for a workout pant, but they do feel very good, and let me observe my legs better than my wide black pants. it's amazing, my legs are starting to look better. more muscles, less flab! yay! unfortunately though, i managed to team the unflattering pants with a t-shirt too short, so that i spend less time admiring my progress, and more time staring at my saddlebags.  on another note, my eating sucks, btw, am constantly grazing and nibbling and longing for food and eating left overs. eek. wonder what it means that my body wants to be fed so often at the moment. am also quite curious as to how much i will weigh on my parents scale on friday. theirs is the one scale that counts, and i haven't been on it in 5 weeks. eep.
