         today's workout: 60 minutes crosstrainer, 60 minute bodystyling class  the cardiostuff on the crosstrainer was fine, did intervalls, at level 5-7, burned 760 kcal or so. enjoyable. could have pushed myself further though, and that is a sucky feeling to have after a workout, i reckon. downside was, that something was wrong with my shoes today, just couldn't get comfortable feet, and that started to really bother me during the lunges in the bodystyling class. hurt like hell. i actually think it's too blame on the sports socks i wore - realised today that they must have shrunk massively in the dryer and are so non-stretchy now, that my toes invitably get cramped in them. add to that now a badly laced workout boot. gah. will not wear the socks anymore.  the bodystyling class was hence quite hampered. also couldn't concentrate and just wasn't too thrilled about doing the same old moves yet again. don't know. just couldn't be bothered, really. quite alarming - i need to concentrate and focus better, it just isn't worth spending time in a class at gym if i don't make the most of it. grr. am a wee little bit angry with myself about this, actually. duh.  anyway. will do better tomorrow, when i am planning on doing three rounds weight circuit, an hour of cardio on the crosstrainer and a 90 minute yoga class.  lock me up, i am overexercising, hooray.
