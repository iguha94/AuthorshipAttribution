         Went to the Gym this morn, to the usual Sunday morning Bodystyling class with Julia and a short 30 minutes on the Crosstrainer. Didn't feel like more today.  The class was good, even though we used those horrid Reebok Tubes , and that wasn't so nice during leg work. Have bad feeling towards my legs again. They are so large, and so muscular (with less jiggle after all), but hey, they are so  WEAK ! Argh. The leg lifts sucked. One third into them, the entire side of my thigh and bum were in a crampy state of pain. That has to change. Unfortunately the only way to do so is by going to the class and fighting my way through the legwork. Oh well. Weight work wise, with Pump twice a week, Bodystyling once a week and weight circuit all other times, my muscles should be getting enough diversity for the moment. Once my stamina is back on track, I'll also add Tae-Bo for the fun factor and killer intensity again. Don't want to get stuck in a movement rut, and with disbalanced muscles.  In any way, was nice this morn, even if I was almost in tears from the pain in my thigh/bum while figthing my way through the set. The 30 minutes on the Crosstrainer were just an add on, really, to loosen my muscles and get my metabolism going for a little while. No major fat-burning action going on.  Will prolly do some major stretching tonight, just because I have this feeling creeping up in my muscles already.  That much for the day. Tomorrow: Pump.
