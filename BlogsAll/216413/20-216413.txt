         some more working out today, without evil stomach pain this time (if a crampy right thigh).  did three rounds on the weight circuit, with some higher weights (triceps, legs, chest) than last time. worked out well, even though, as mentioned, my right thigh got all sore. duh.  later went to a 45 minute step class by sanne, which was as enjoyable as the one last week. quite a thriller. did the same choreography, and the final round -to the sound of "can't get you out of my head" was so enjoyable and energizing tha ti still had energy to sing along. i guess i have finally got a hang of this step thing. strange! :)  to top off, i stayed for the 30 minute ab class, which was fabulous, too. hard enough, entertaining enough. kept imagining myself in a bikini when things got difficult. hello, my name is carolin, and yes, i exercise to look good on the beach.  am pondering whether i should just work out for one hour tomorrow. can't go in the morn, because i have a dentist appointment. first though my options in the evening were spiining followed by pumo, however it's buffy time by 9pm, so.... reckon i'll either just do spinning, or do weight rounds, then spinning. am leaning towards the first a wee bit. - might be a good idea to not do weight training for a day for a change.  anyway: these thoughts are proof i am not seriously overexcercising yet:  buffy still rates higher than pump.
