         wasn't in the mood to turn on the puter when coming back from the gym last night.  yesterday, i did my usual monday program of a 60 minute pump class with bettina, followed by a 60 minute step class by claudia.  pump was fun, we did a different -old- set, which had fab music and was a lot harder than the one thy currently use.   weights per side  warm up 3 1/2 kg  legs (squats) 6 kg  chest 3 1/2 kg  back 4 1/2 kg  triceps 3 1/2 kg  biceps 3 1/2 kg  shoulders 2 1/2 kg / 2 1/2 for side lifts  legs (lunges) 5 kg   step was good, too. only downside is that i hate the jumping/running bits between the seperate step sections - it makes me feel all wobbly and jiggly and yuck. need an even better sports bra, i guess. urgh.  today, i did my three weight rounds, which were okay, went to a 45 minute step class by andrea and finished off with a 30 minute ab class. all good. i liked step, however, andrea was rather quick with step changes, so quick, that the other (bigger) lady in the class got very frustrated because she couldn't keep on. as a result, andrea toned both impact and speed down significantly, so that i didn't get as much out of it as i had hoped for. oh well. overall however, two good gym days.
