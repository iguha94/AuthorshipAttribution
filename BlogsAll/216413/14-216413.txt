         it's still very hot, and going to the gym would still be insane.  as a substitute, i went to the pool early in the morning, before the sun started to be all evil. swam lenghts for a good 60 minutes, mainly breaststroke (the only fair stroke in a full pool), with few breaks. took extra time to correct my technique.  all in all, a nice experience. i love that certain pool, the air was warm, the water refreshingly cool, and when i started out at 7:30am, it wasn't too full yet. felt good to move, felt good to be surrounded by water, felt good to just float and not feel gravity for a while, felt good to be cool. all very lovely.  tomorrow, i'll go again (unless the thunderstorms kick in already), just 30 minutes earlier, to avoid the crowds that came in by 8am.  only downside: when towelling off afterwards, the leftovers of my fake tan came off too, and left even more vitiligo-like bits of skin behind.  must have been the soaking in the water for a good hour. quite annoying.  can't this happen evenly?  anyone any ideas how to speed up cell turnover? i'm already using my silicone body brush in the shower every time but still have these discoloured patches everywher). rubbing myself off with lemon juice doesn't quite seem like a good option, hm? i really want to get another layer of tan on (after a few days of moisturising my little heart out), but don't dare to, before all this blotchiness has gone.....
