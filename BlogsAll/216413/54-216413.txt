         Kiwis are very inventive people. Bungee Jumping (even though that idea was stolen from some natives in Papua-NewGuinea). Cookie Time cookies. These odd large rubber balls in which you can roll down a hill.    Now they are putting a good use to all that fur of the run over useless possums on the West Coast.     Nipple warmers a standout success    15 June 2001  By NICOLA BOYES    What's cute, fuzzy and slips inside your bra on a cold winter morning? The hottest thing at this year's Fieldays near Hamilton - possum skin nipple warmers.  West Coast company Gray Fur Trading sold more than 500 nipple warmers in their first day of trading at Mystery Creek, though owner Peter Gray says sales could be attributed to the -1 degree frost.  "Some people came through and brought half a dozen while others just brought one set. Mothers have picked them up saying "oh I have to take something home for my daughter". "It's just a big laugh really." Mr Gray said the nipple warmers are made out of possum skin off-cuts and slip inside a bra "fur to nipple". "I've heard they're very warm." He says they are just the ticket for those often embarrasing cold mornings in the cowshed.  Mr Maunganui fashion design student Leigh Johnson tried the nipple warmers out at yesterday's Fieldays. "They really are quite warm aren't they? They're good, really soft." Since the company started making the nipple warmers about one year ago Mr Gray said they have had orders from as far away as America. "One lady called up wanting 2000 of them. They're quite serious about them over there." First time exhibitors at the Fieldays, Mr Gray said it is also the first time anyone from the South Island's West Coast has run a site at the event.     Obviously, wearing these nipple warmers makes you smile rather dumbly.   Still a funky idea. I'd definitely want one.  :)  (through   supermodels are lonelier than you think )
