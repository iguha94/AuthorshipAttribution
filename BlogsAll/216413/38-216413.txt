         Over. It's OVER! I am freeeeeeeeeee!  (At least until tomorrow afternoon, when I need to get back on the work for my civil law paper.)  It went reasonably well. Those were 3 hours in hell, but I think I did an ok job. Not brilliant, but reasonable. It made sense, and civil law doesn't always make sense. Am still all hyped up and having a lovely glass of wine to calm down a little. Phew. I survived this, and there wasn't a panic attack either!  Tomorrow morning shall be spend law-less. Gotta clean this place (which is FILTHY at the mo)  and get some stuff into the basement (I think the SPG™ are getting annoyed with the stuff still on my balcony). Then some waiting for my package from amazon.com. Working out around lunchtime with Tina, then back to work on paper. Buffy Season (season 4) Finale in the evening. Yay.  The rest of the week shall be pleasurable and pass by quickly, too. Thursday, I shall work on the paper and work out. In the evening, Tina is holding her birthday bash to which I will be going with Michel. I will get completely smashed, I tell ya. Early Friday morning, I'll make my way home for the weekend. My dad actually invited me, the rents haven't seen me since Easter and apparently miss me. And I need a haircut and some clothes and someone to cook for me, so it shall be good, all in all.  Looking forward to going home. Oh, all is good now. How nice, how nice.
