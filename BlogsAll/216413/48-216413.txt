         I am childish. And controlling. And distrusting. And fucking scared.  Ev called Psychobitch today and went to that party where she was, too, and the mere fact that he has called her could make me walk up the walls..but that isn't true. It makes me sad. And insecure. I'd rather hide somewhere instead of walking up walls. I don't know. I am just so scared that the whole bullshit will start again. That this one stupid call (which I think he shouldn't have made in the first place) has sparked some new hope in Psychobitch's head and that she will start wanting to see him again.  I should trust him in making the right decision, but I just can't. I really can't; I simply never got the motivations behind all the bullshit of last year, the avoiding certain parts of Melbourne because of her, my not-meeting his friends because of her, and what the hell. I don't want her around him. I just don't. I can't stand the thought of her around him, even though I know it would me even more childish then I already am to ask him not to see her anymore. I have no right to control his life, after all. And I really don't  *want* to control his life. I want to trust him, but it really doesn't work in respect to her.  The last few months were so calm. Not just because she wasn't there, she's not *that* important, after all, but simply because things were...stable. Okay. Clear. Defined.  The fact that he called her just shows that things between them aren't normal yet, if they were, he would have just gone to the party and have given a shit. Really. If she wanted to pull a scene, it would have been her fault, why worry then? All his friends finally think she's overreacting very much in regards to Ev. So why does he even care? I don't get it.  The same old fuck has started again.  Hooray.  One completely fine day for me would have been too much, I assume.
