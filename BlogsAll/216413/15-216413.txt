         Felt yesterday's pump class comfortably in my muscles today, just the right amount of after-work-out tension. Lovely.  Today, I first did 20 minutes on the crosstrainer, set in intervall, just warm up my comfortably achy muscles and get my metabolism going.  Then circuit class with Bettina, which was really good. We started out with about 20 minutes of warm-up and cardio activity on the step, then -in teams of two- did one round of 2 minutes each at 8 stations, which were PUMP moves with barbell, ab work and one coordination excercise. Then another 15 minutes of step, before we did a final 1 minute each round, cooldown and stretching.  It was a nice & taxing class, much more taxing then I had anticipated when Bettina told me yesterday what she had planned for this morning. I sure preferred this to a pure step class. During the step phase I realised though that no one had elevated their steps but me. I honestly couldn't remember whether I had accidently grabbed an already elevated step or had automatically elevated it like we have to for PUMP. Odd.  Psychologically, it was a good day at the gym, too: felt strong, and had a good time looking at myself in the mirror. Wore a tank top, and could nicely watch my arms during the exercise, which was quite a motivator. Hope I wasn't too  "in your face"  with the lady who was my teammate, who just started out at the gym and who hence always used a lot lighter weights then me. Would hate to come across as horrible as the skinny blonde who annoys me so much. Ugh.  Anyway: feeling good. Hope I will feel good even though I can't go to the gym the next three days. Will subsitute with Yoga and a few simple strength and stretchiong exercises at home.
