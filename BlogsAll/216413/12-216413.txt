         The killer Bodystyling session from Sunday (which I didn't post about: killer, killer killer session with Julia,  focused on bum and back followed by 30 minutes crosstrainer action) left me with very sore buns and legs, bailed out of working out yesterday, but thankfully forced myself this afternoon. Did two rounds on the weight circuit and 45 minutes on the crosstrainer. Not *that* much, but more than enough for my still from the flue recovering body. Finished with some decent stretching afterwards.  Hopped on the scale again, which indeed still showed the 9 pounds less. Amazing.  In any way, working out was nice, and it felt great to lie on the floor surrounded by mirrors which reflected the awesome moody dusk outside: the sky was pinkish-blue and foggy and wintery. Very nice. Still don't like look in the mirror much: I can like my upper body and abs lots, but really, my lower half (while already slimmer and firmer) still pretty much sucks. These hips will always be there: with a pelvis like this, there is no getting away from it. These legs will never be longer. I am again starting to like my lower half more, but well, it ain't easy, it ain't easy. Anyway. No whining. Working out was nice, and wasted some time, too, that I would otherwise had spent waiting. Sigh. Unbelievable. Tomorrow.  Will waste some more time with Pump and an hour on the crosstrainer tomorrow morning. I fear that otherwise I will go insane waiting until it's time for me to hop on the train.
