           "The Times"  reported this week:    Blonde lawyers don't have more fun     BY LAURA PEEK     FAIR-HAIRED lawyers in the United States have declared a National Blonde Day to dispel the myth of the dumb blonde. They are fed up with people ignoring their law degrees and seeing their hair as a “stupidity signal”.  The Blonde Legal Defence Club has been established by a group of lawyers in Los Angeles to support anyone who has been “treated wrongly for their follicular appearance”. Its mission is to “stop the widespread belief that blondes are dumb and incapable, to destroy blonde stereotypes and to publicise blonde accomplishments throughout history, dispelling the myths and mistakes about blondes.”   Icons from Marilyn Monroe to Robert Redford have complained that their hair colouring has led to their work being taken less seriously. Indeed, a new Hollywood film, Legally Blonde, addresses the issue. A fashion student is rejected by her ambitious boyfriend because her platinum-coloured hair would make her an unsuitable political wife. She becomes a star student at Harvard Law School to prove him wrong. The Harvard Law Bulletin wrote about the film and suggested that prejudice over hair colour is real among professional women, even those with Harvard law degrees.   “We’ve had to endure untold hardships,” Fern Magnin, of the Blonde Club, said. “We’re not going to stand for it any more.” National Blonde Day is on July 9.  (through   supermodels are lonelier than you think)     I can relate. So how shall I celebrate National Blonde Day?   Anyone an idea?
