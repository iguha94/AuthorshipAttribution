         Better today. No whining about my lack of hunger and desire for food today. No depressive bouts of crying today either.  While at the   gym  today, I read an article in   Stern , the title story is on Depression. The authour quite obviously recently read   Andrew Solomon's "The noonday demon" . All rather superficial (if you consider how very in depth "The noonday demon" is), but still a good article, trying to destigmatize this disease. Made me wonder again whether my current thoughts, fears and behaviour would validate the use of anti-depressants again. I somehow still think it would be worth to give it a try. Hmph.  Decided to have an off day today, just to sort some stuff out before I have to get busy. (instructions downloaded last night) and all the preparations for Ev's arrival; even though the latter is, of course, a good thing to prepare for. Need to jot a to-do-list down, but am avoiding that, for fear that once I see it all on paper/in pixel, I'll be too scared to start. *lol* Things to do tomorrow (that would be on that invisible list): finally check out the bed shop; check Amsterdam Hotels for New Years, work out, start paper. Oy.  For tonight, all I'll do is clean up this place a bit and watch Buffy and Angel and be online and surf for some good stuff for Saturdays   linkandthink  blogging event. We had another ignorant troll at the   boards  yesterday, some "kid" (not quite sure whether that was a kid, or just  another bored Baptists pastor from Virginia) spreading the word that true love waits is the solution for all problems, and that condoms had holes big enough for HIV to pass through. Yeah. Lovely.  Good thing: Two weeks from now, I will be on my way to Frankfurt Airport. Unbelievable.
