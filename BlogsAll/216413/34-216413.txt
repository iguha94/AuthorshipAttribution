         there's no kidding myself anymore: winter, cosy partnered living & eating, stress at uni, recurring health issues of the serious kind and a change in birth control pills have caused some not so good changes in my body. -  it's about time to get more structured about working out again, and this blog has helped with this in the past. how good that summer is back and the bike is usable, both makes the gym highly accesible.  the current goals: &middotgetting rid of 7kg of unneeded fat without freaking out about numbers on scales; &middot getting into a regular workout routine without freaking out because of time constraints; and above all &middot feeling stronger and even more energetic than i already do anyway. on the eating side of things, i've been transforming from ovo-lacto-vegetarian to vegan over the past few weeks, which has been a fab experience so far: i'm eating better than ever, i guess; the only downside being a strange craving for nuts lately, and while i know about their nutritional value, i know about their fat content, too.  no working out today though: i'm stuck at home with an evil sore throat and head cold. all attempts to make myself go to the gym this morning failed miserably, which -looking back- was probably the best thing to do: this cold has gotten worse and worse throughout the day, i can't even stand or walk properly.  grrrrrr.  hopefully, i'll feel better tomorrow, so that a gentle bike ride with andrea and some yoga are doable activity options.
