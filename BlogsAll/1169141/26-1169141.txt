Why do I do these things????   So, yesterday my life went in a different direction like always. I was supposed to be going to " pregones Movie house" to catch a play of some sort. My dad decided to get  a referral for the eye doctor so Fish was on foot  and threw my plans into the gutter. So, one interesting evening spent at home won't kill me. Funny thing is, 8:30pm was my first jaunt in La La Land. I fell asleep in my couch and that is not comfy. I don't know how people can nap on the couch the whole night. So, my power nap ended at 3:30am and I was up. Ok, so I was up and I turned on the Boob tube and BEHOLD!!!!!!.................. They were giving " Orca ". Oh man, I loved this movie. This flick was shot and released in 1977. It starred " Richard Harris " as an ignorant Irish Fisherman ( which the apple didn't fall far from the tree because he is Irish ). He is hunting Great White Sharks and comes Across an Orca Whale making minced meat out of a Great White. Sure Enough, Orca's are bigger and badder then great white so we have Harris hunting the Orca. Fast forward.........   He hunts Orca Shoots at Male Orca Misses and hits female Orca which is pregnant and miscarries baby orca on boat Male Orca goes O.J and stalks harris and creates havoc on the town Towns people force Harris to Hunt down Orca Harris Follows Orca to Iceland Orca methodically kills crew Catches harris is water after he destroys boat Tail whips harris onto iceburg and kills him  This Movie was incredible because I saw it when I was 6 years old with my dad in the movie and it kept me interested. I kinda appreciated the movie even more now because I could actually understand more of the movie.  So, I would write about my dreams but most likely you would never come back and read my blogger.  I swear to you........ I have issues!!!!!!!!  I will write some more later. I have to sneak out of here today.  Peace
