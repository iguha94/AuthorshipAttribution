Time to START THE REVOLUTION!!!!!!! URBAN POETS will RISE UP against the man and change the wayward ways of the white man!!!!  Last night was the finals in Urbana and it basically sucked. THat is even giving them credit. I think the host is what killed me. If he reads poetry the way he hosts, he is going to SUCK really bad.!!!!!!!!!. Ok, so the new team from Urbana will now live up to the word " Urban ". Nothing but black folk across the board made the team. I actually don't mind and I even like it to be that way. Taylor is going to do some crazy shit. I hope he works off Julian's " Nigger " poem. This dude dropped a poem last night and said " nigger " 42 times. He will put Quentin Tarrantino to shame.  All in all, the slam didn't impress me. This year, not many slams impressed me at all. I guess in going and hearing so much poetry, you don't get wowed as much. Yet. I hope the Finals at Bar 13 will be killer.   Let me see who is in finals.....  Roger F Omar Lynne Dawn Shawn Shappy Marty Tai Claudia  I am going to go out on a limb and try to pick the players for the 2003 Union Square team. Shawn is questionable because he could actually drop out and that could leave Isle with a chance to make the team. So, I will throw her in by default.  This years Union SquARE  tem will be ..............  ROGER, TAI, Claudia, Shappy......... Marty as the Alternate. Shappy will be the obligatory white man and he would balance off well the team.   Shit, let me go do my rikers class, I am taking Oscar today.  Peace my nizzle'z!!!!!!!!!
