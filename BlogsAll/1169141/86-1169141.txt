Actual Blood family sucks!!!!!   Ok, the Demon spawn bloodsucking leaches have arrived from Puerto Rico via driving from Florida.  They were not even in NYC yet and they made my life a living hell. I was at home catching a nap because I was tired. I got up and took a quick shower and I was walking out the door and sure enough, my dad was walking to my door with this face like " oh, you are going to et mad ". Sure enough, these people called and they were on the NJ turnpike. I asked my Dad where. He doesn't know. I asked them what time they called, he doesn't know. I asked them if they know how to get to the house, he doesn't know. I love my father with such a fervor that nothing can beat that, but Pop, you were worthless to me yesterday. The only thing that made life easier was that they called from a cell phone and I got to call them back ( via caller ID ) from my pops cell. I told them to get off in the first visually enticing exit in the BRonx and I met up with them with my Dad in tow. Now, the family in question is my mothers Borther. That motherfucker is not my uncle. My uncle is someone that calls me and I call them. Treats me like family and I treat them like family. I have seen this guy about 3 times in my 32 years of life. So, I am closer to some of the Louder Folks that I have seen everyday then this Balding arrogant bastard that I never see. You know I am going somewhere with this.  This motherfucker gets in the car and he starts quick with some typical Puerto Rican Peer pressure nonsense........  " So, how long you been married?" " Wow, you are fat " " you are not married?, you need to get married because you are not getting any younger " " Are there casino's here, I promised to take my wife, ( I interject and tell them there is one about 3 hours away ), I promised to take my wife, can you drive us ?" " WHy don't you have kids ?"                Note: I have a brother that gay, so, guess what THIS MOTHERFUCKER  says........  " I hope you ddidn't come out like your brother, you never are going to have kids like that "  PEOPLE!!!  10 minutes in the car and I have never regretted the fact that I never have seen this guy for more then 4 hours in my life!!!!  Now, here is the kicker, guess where I am driving to either tonight or Wednesday night??? Yep, my mother called me and pulled out the " I never ask for anything " card. Oh man, I love my moms but these are the times when I feel like moving to Florida now instead of next summer.  The majority of my life, it has been Pops, moms and me. No uncles, aunts, cousins, nephews, neices etc. My Abuelita from my Dads side was the only one that I loved more then life. When she died, I lost all my connections to those Puerto Rican dissidents residing on that small island of Borinquen.   So, can you tell I had a horrible night last night.   The best part about anything was that when I got to Louder ( bar 13 ), I started feeling a little bit better.  I actually took place in the slam last night and that made my mind at ease. It was a good night and I felt sooooo much better after some poetry and looking at Eric G dressed in drag ( Don't ask ).  Last night was the cover slam in which you had to read a poem by someone else. I chose to read " Miguel Pinero's, The book of genisis according to San Miguelito ". I did ok, I got 9 's across the board. The high 9's still beat me out. Roger, Regie Cabico, Obena, Oscar took home books and money. Oscar took the the triple threat with a Poem by Jimmy Santiago Baca.  Can lose when you reading Baca.  So, I got to work early today and I feel good. I am going to be a little bit busy so my e-mails are kinda limited today.  I am linking Oscar's page for you can see some info for the Party on Saturday, we are going to PARTY HARDCORE!!!!!!!!    Party Info!!!   Peace, Love  Take care  Fish  >)))">
