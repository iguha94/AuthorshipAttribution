Everything is good?   Well, yesterday was a good day. I had some work to do because my co-worker decided to take the day off. I don't mind, most of my day I spent switching around this blog and creating havoc. I posted some shit yesterday and if you didn't still the code, too bad. I know I pushed the issue yesterday with some immoral shit, but you know what??? I say anything in front of anybody at anytime. I am not a hypocrite. I pride myself by that motto. If I don't like you, I am not talking to you. So, here goes, if I never at anytime have even muttered a " hello" to you or attempted to engage in a conversation, this means I don't like you. Most likely, you won't like me netiehr so it's best to keep your distance. I have a persona of the nicest guy in the world, until you get on my bad side. I have a temper and I wouldn't want anyone to see that bad side.  I am not much in a good mood today as you can tell from the start of my blog. I am really close to just going away for a little while. Things are getting complicated and I am hating it. No Poetry, No Bar 13,no reading,no visits, No hanging out, No phone calls, no writing, no teaching,no nothing!!! I hate when things happen and they get me more confused and fucked up in the head. I am writing this through fucking tears right now. My life is going great with the new people in my life. The collective are a great bunch and I am loving them. Eric is my heart and I miss him so fucking dearly.  all Positive right?? Well, My dad might lose his job.  My mother is not happy just staying home.I don't know what I want in my life!!!!!!! I want get away from everything . Everytime, something happens, it makes my life worse. I don't want to speak to anybody right now. No therapists, doctors, friends, God. I want to crawl into a little hole and forget about everything positive and negative and just be alone.   Just need some time.... maybe a week, maybe a month, maybe till the day I die.   ( sigh )  I started this at 8:30am and I still haven't hit publish.  I am going to try and do something positive here.   The lovingly sexy Lynne mentioned that she will partake in the Dark Future slam. This defintely has made me go up several notches. The best feature I have had thus far was at First Wednesday because Lynne and Rog were my Co-features. If I am competing against Lynne, I have to get my Apocalypse and Headlines down to a science. I also have to write one more and I am thinking of doing a " Ghetto Matrix " type of theme.  The bar was really good yesterday. The open mic was decent and I read a piece by one of the fellas I teach over at Rikers Island. I had to tweak the piece a little bit because of the grammer issue. It was a good read and I was pretty happy. The feature was Tony Brown from Massachusets. His poetry was awesome. The images that came from his voice were hands down incredible. I got his chapbook and I was excited about reading it.  Afte Tony was the Head to head slam between Shappy and Guy. The highlight....... No fucking doubt about it.... Guy reading " Quacky ". He had the bar and me in tears. Even though it was Shappy's work, he played it to a key!!! Guy is the man. Even though Shappy beat him 3 rounds too 2. So, urbana is still under 2 slams to 1. The next head to head is Dawn -vs- Lynne. If the terms are accepted, that should be a good match. I wonder how long this is going to go for. 5 slam limit???? Best out of 5 slams ??? I would love to see other matches too....  Big George -vs- Seve Moonshine -vs- Ed Their little retarded DJ - Vs - Frant ( DJ Hot nuts )  That would be fun....  Well, let me go be in a bad mood.  I will catch all of you soon.  Peace        Not the Point
