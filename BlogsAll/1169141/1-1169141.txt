Good Morning Folks,  This is my way of just giving you an opportunity of looking at my mindframe everyday. I am not going to e-mail everyday because you all will get sick of me. Well, All is well on the eastern front of my world. I went home yesterday and hung out with my parent and that is always a good thing. My dad is kinda worried because his job is not doing well. Shit, how can Ieven tell him that my job is on it's last legs too. We have a meeting today and who knows what else will happen. I just keep that positive mindset and everything will fall into place.   I stood home last night watching TV and actually got to catch NYPD blue. That is one of the best shows still left on the Boob Tube . Everything comes and goes and it is basically crap. Yet, they tend to keep me as an avid watcher. Nothing else really turned me on last night, not even the porno that I so gratuitously receive. I kinda get sick of porn after a while. Every single woman starts looking and sounding alike after several strokes from a 25 inch wang that double as a can / tripod.   Today is good ol Wednesday and I am taking off Tomorrow and Friday. Tomorrow I am just taking some " Me " time. I wanted to take it on the weekend but I did so much and I want to be left alone. I know that being alone sucks but hey, I like to be alone. I have always been a loner and I know I will die alone.  Ok... On to Poetry news... What can I say... Next Tuesday is Acentos and I will be there with my partner in tow ( or vice versa ). We have an HBO Def Poet in the likeness of Emanuel Xavier. Shit should be off the hook.   All is good  Peace Love Swallow like a fat chic on an Easter Ham  >)))">
