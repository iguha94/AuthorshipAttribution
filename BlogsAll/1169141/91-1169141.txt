The world is safe   I am in my house and today was the day in which I have realized that poetry is what you make it. Yesterday was the day of the Dark Future slam. I had an incredible time. Taylor Mali is hands down a bonafide nutcase with a creative energy on top of tooooooo much ample time!!!!   Yesterday, the Corporation consisted of   Agent Mali , Agent Saylor, Agent Neil, and   Agent Bermeo  and several other Bowery stragglers. The slam consisted of 12 people in which only Poems envisioning a dystopic future were allowed. You would have to recite your poem under one of several conditions alotted to you. The conditions were a miriad of straight up crazyness!!!!!!!!!  Hands tied behind your back Wearing a hood over your head ( I got stuck on this one ) Music blasted in your ear Water thrown in your face they would take you some where in the back and shine lights in your face  and a whole bunch more  I was second up and I had a gut feeling that this hood thing was going to be given to me. Sure enough, that shit was no joke!!!! I had on a long trench trying to look the part. So, I go to the stage and the hood goes over my face. They put me in front of the microphone and I start my piece.........  30 seonds later I start going into overdrive in the poem for a buildup to the climax. PROBLEM: The buildup means breathing hard is proving a chore and that hood wasn't so kind with the oxygen. 1 minute into the poem and with every breathe, the cloth of the hood would go into my mouth. The heat was rising in the hood, the bad breathe was getting me dizzy. So, when my pause in the poem came and everybody was clapping, I said FUCK that .... I WAS DONE!!!!! It was about 600 degrees under that hood. I started wheezing. My breathe was atrocious!!!!!!!!!!!  so, a 7.5 later.......I was happy as a pig in shit when that hood came off ******************  This note is from the Revolutionary front called " FREE the WORD " Last night, we, members of free the word toppled the corporation and they have buckled under our passion to keep the word free.  FREE THE WORD!!!!!!!!! FREE THE WORD!!!!!!!!! FREE THE WORD!!!!!   ************************************  That was the best part of the evening!! I was recruited to be part of " La Resistance " . We all rushed the stage and a gun point, we made the corporation our bitches!!!!!  This was hands down the best night I have ever had in Poetry. No winners were declared in this slam but I knew I wasn't  going to win. Yet, I had fun and that was what I was going there for.   I have found a new found respect for Taylor and everyone putting this together. They had every nook and cranny taken care of. Cameras recording the audience and the poets, A digital camera to take pictures, a projector, and everything just fell into place.  I might not have won the slam but I have another piece in the memory bank. At least I know, be ready for anything when you are participating in a Mali Production.  Great time. Great People.
