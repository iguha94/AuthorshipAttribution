She sings    She was 21 with fair olive tone skin Her eyes were wide and her hair flaccid peppered with miss clairol highlights She was of Puerto Rican Descent to a mother that worked in a factory, a father that was a security guard and a bagel maker She was the first to finish high school and seem destined to become great. She sings of success  She attends community college and scrapes by with minumal financial aid Her friends talk of parties, young men, and the far too often cheap sexual tryst that made                                                     most young women sluts. Her mind wanders and her work in school shows it with the far more common “ c” and “d” and a gpa that barely broke 2. Her best friend would convince her to attend a neighborhood party She sings of something new  Deadlines for papers come and it doesn’t matter,  she is no where to be found.  Her attendance poor and her attention span worse Academic probation, warnings, and finally she was convinced to leave school She sings rebellion  She parties and swallows demons, becoming free of life, she sings the liquor She smokes her songs of rebellion. She drinks her melodies of utopia She sings her pain of becoming the victim of three ways, lurid pictures, and the occasional STD. Time stops when she rest her head on her pillow while nursing her bruises, split lips, and loosened teeth She sings her sadness  Blinding chants building on her songs, she loses herself. She loses her songs of success. Her songs of darkness and dismay more apparent in her teetering between failure and her yearning song of redemption.  She sings and cries,  she sings her anger at herself  She sings failure She sings her addiction She sings her late night tricks  Strumming her keys of desperation, she reconciles her stringent song She finds her rhythm in righteousness A lullaby of praise She sings a long road to travel back   If you got this far, you will now know that the previous poem is what I call a super first draft. I will make some edits and remind myself of my Five edit and revise rule.  Leave some feedback in the guestbook. I should read this one in about 5 weeks.  LOL  Peace
