hee hee   I just got back and I swear I must have been a whore in another life. Yesterday, I made some quick flyers overviewing the " 5 past 13 A little bit Louder: Volume 1 " CD. I have Fridays off and I was making this day constructive. I headed to Barnes and Noble an the Bronx and dropped about 50 flyers there. Since I have nothing to do until 4pm, I put one Acentos Flyer/ CD flyer on every car in the Parking lot. Well, not every car. Since I ran out of flyers and I made 300 flyers, you figure it out. LOL. I truly just threw out my cell phone on these flyers. Whatever I have to do to pimp these things. I am doing it. I have to call guy or hopefully he will read this.   " I think this check wrote out a check to LOUDERARTS, I hope it can get cashed. "  Anyway, I feel ok today. No work, No poetry, no issues. I am just doing my thing.  I am going to Rikers today and everything seems well. Oscar has the Class today and Next week is the day to integrate the next instructor. Let's see how this is going to work.  Ok, I brought mself some " cookies and cream " ice cream. So while most of you guys are at work right now, I will be in my boxer shorts gratuitously scratching and watching porn. I just wanted to share.   Well, more on my stupidy later.  Peace. Love, May your booty never get as big as J-lo
