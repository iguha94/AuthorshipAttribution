Sometimes I just wonder..........   Well, I finally got enough thoughts in order to Blast " THe Hulk " as intellectual as possible. You see, last night when I got home, if I would have entered a blog, it would have read like this.......... " The Hulk was a piece of shit movie and I wasted my time!!!!!!!!!!". Yet, I waited to let the anger subside until today and enter a review of what I thought the movie was lacking.  Well, The movie was different. It had things hat I never even remotely seen done in other movies. Let me get to the Best parts of the movie.  Great transitioning between scenes. It was very " Comic Bookish " Some split scenes were pretty cool to give you an idea or perspectives from different camera angles The special effects of course wre awesome. The hulk character at first seemed so fake and you teneded to forget that throughout his appearances.   What was bad......... I am saying the the storyline was good but the delivery was bland. You needed a much need extra boost to keep you interested in the context and what they were trying to make you believe.   What I felt was most lacking were the scores in the movie and the music buildup. We have to face facts, a movie with an awesome buildup of music will put an average movie over the edge. The fast and the furious would have been garbage with opera as the main scores.   The movie really didn't do it for me and I hope that all of you comic book fans won't dismiss this movie that fast. Maybe you all will love it. The common feeling through out the movie theater ( all 5 of us  was dissappointment ). I got to see a super late screening at 2:30am with just some employees.    I guess I can't complain that much, I didn't pay for the movie so why beef? I just figure that if  did pay for it, I would have entered that first blog.  Ok, be good  Peace, Love  Take care  fish  >)))">
