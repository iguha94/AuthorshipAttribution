What's going my brethren???????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Today is my first day off of two. Toorrow, I have off and I have the poetry workshop that I am running in Rikers Island. Yes, I have actually gone out and took over a workshop in Rikers Island. Of course, I am teaching inmates from a variety of ages. Tey are all pretty smart and have a decent knack for writing. I have to thank my Dawg Rog for giving me this opportunity. This guy is awesome to say something about him on the smallest of scales. So, I am off to the Island tomorrow with my Dawg Oscar in tow. He is smart as fuck so I wouldn't worry about him on the teaching aspect of t all. Yet, I hope he gets used to the guys in this jail setting. Me?????? Well, I felt kinda right at home.  Tonight is my night to head to the Bowery and just get a fill of " Finals " poetry. They have the usual schmoes up there and it should live up to the " Urbana " type of poetry that it is.  I am thinking " George is making it. Postmidnight might have a go. RAC and mabe Dawn Saylor. Cristen might get in the mix one way or the other. I wish Taylor was on the team. Iactually like that guy. He is kinda like the white version of me.   Well, on that note...... Time to bounce.  Peace  Fish
