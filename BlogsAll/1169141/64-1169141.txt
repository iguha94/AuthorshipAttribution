My mornings suck.......   I wonder why in the hell do things happen to me. I wake up and I get out of bed and I am  careful because I am convinced that a " Final Destination " type of entity is yearning to just destroy my day.   I pick up the tube of toothpaste this morning and I squeeze some onto the tootbrush and the last little bristle ( is that even a word ) flicks some tootpaste into my eye. OH MAN!!!!!  Now I know what I need to torture Lenny into giving me some, I just have to tie her up and put toothpaste into her eye.  The burning sensation will have even the toughest of the tough screaming like a baby.  So, yesterday was a good day. I got a letter from the Osborne association thanking the LouderARTS project for all the hard work that Oscar and I did for the FreshStart Program. Most likely, I will attach it at the bottom of this page. Feels good to have someone be thankful for the hardwork that you do. Makes life feel really good.  Nationals is getting really close and I am getting antsy. It is going to be a ball out there. We are going to have fun and get the whole experience and soak it like a sponge.  Today I am going to sneak out of here and go to an interview for " Mind Builders ". It is an organization for youth to research culture and folk lore. My name came up and I was contacted for a showcase on August 16. It should be fun with all the little kids interviewing me and asking me questions. So, 12:30pm and I will formally play bellvue at my job and ask to leave. LOL. Gotta love the job.  Let me run  Peace, Love  Take care  Chuletas con papas  Fish  ***************Following is a letter from Osborne***************  Dear LouderARTS project,  Words cannot begin to express the tremendous impact that the wonderful poets of the Louder Arts Project have had on the Fresh Start program and its participants. Our students have embraced writing and the creative process not only as a form of self-_expression but also as an alternative to self-defeating behaviors. Their enlightenment as a result of Sam and Oscar’s workshops has brought great excitement and wonderful new options into their lives.  The students were able to let their guards down and allowed themselves to be vulnerable and even a bit sensitive. Many of our students discovered areas of themselves that they never knew existed and thought in ways that they never knew were possible. Sam and Oscar truly blessed our students with a gift that can never be taken away from them for as long as they live. As the saying goes, " if you give a hungry man a fish, he eats for one day but if you teach him to fish, he eats for a lifetime ".  The students of the Fresh Start Program were given jewels that far outweigh any form of materialism. On behalf of the Osborne Association and the Fresh Start Program, we thank the Louder Arts Project for Sam and Oscar and hope to continue this relationships in the future.  Sincerely,  Marianna Shturman  Program Director  ************************  Life is Good *******************************
