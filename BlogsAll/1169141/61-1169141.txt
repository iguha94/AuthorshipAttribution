BBQ and overkill   oH MAN, I just got to the household and I wanted to write this incredible email on the great time that I had today at my boys BBQ. Then, I opened this e-mail that had to be the best e-mail from any poet that I have ever gotten. I got the e-mail in response to my last blog entry and it threw me for a loop. I will see if with the permission of said sender, I could share it. Until then, hear about my day.  So, I headed to Mike's house for his Birthday celebration today in Ossinning, NY. I need to tell you first thing about what was placed in my stomach.  shishkabobs............ 5 ribs..........................4 burgers.....................2 cookies ( homemade)....at least ten. chocolate mint girl scout cookies salad 1 plate of rice 10 homade girl scout cookies 7 bootleg cola sodas salad coffee  I would write about the batroom experience but more people then I realized read this blog. UHhhhhhhhhhhhh........ Fuck that. I Blew that bathroom to pieces. :)  I had a great time at Mike's house and I would not mind going up there again. It is a great place to get away and the neighborhood is quite. He got the BBQ and I think I am taking my Hammock up there.   Alot of people were there and it was very nice and they treated us well. I was happy. Food was being thrown at the token fat Puerto Rican guy. I had no qualms eating it. Tom was his usual self and I forgot how beash he is with some of his comments, still, Tom is tom and I pretty much accepted it.  Ok, I would write in more detail but I have the previous e-mail I forementioned to reply too.  Take care  Peace Love  Watch Spice Clips on the hot network, it is off the hook
