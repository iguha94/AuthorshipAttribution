Should I or Shouldn't I?   The weekend falls upon us and I am torn between 15 different things to do. I wanted to go to this Poetry reading tonight but I think it is going to be about 4 million people trying to audition to get on DEF poetry Jam. That is certainly not something I am interested in doing if it just all about that.  If I had my Cd's with me, I could go and maybe just pump them suckers like the mad pimp that I am.  So, tonight looks like I will jsut go and do my own thing. I was suppose to go out to dinner tomorrow with a freind of mines but things got complicated and I have to turn down any invites with precursor's.    on July 3rd is my first day at Bedford Hills and I can't make it because of this Darf Future slam. I really don't want to miss it. That is going to suck. I have to call and tell them that a slam has taken priority over teaching, I bet my life is going straight down hill after that.  Well, I am staying away from everybody this weekend. So, just let me be and I will catch all of you on Monday. I am going to see a therapists Monday so be ready to hear some brand new revelations in my life. IF this motherfucker doesn't help, alot of unhappy people will come to be.  Time to go  Have a great weekend.  Peace, Love  Take care  >)))">
