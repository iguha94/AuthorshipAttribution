Need I complain???   Ok, I sign on to post this blog and they changed the format and I almost screamed. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ???? I hate change.  Ok, it is 6:00am and I am typing. This means that it was hot last night and I ddin't sleep worth one nickel. I have an AC but I hate them things. Give me my fan and I am happy.  Anyway, last night I was flicking through the TV and I caught a new show on Playboy. It is kinda like a Candid camera tye of show but the pranks are hilarious. I caught this one prank and I laughed throughout.  They had three unsuspecting dudes take part in a study abot how men get turn on with certain stimuli. They put this thing on the guys. It was kinda like what boxers wear to protect their genital area. It was connected to some wires which went to this machine with a dial from 0.0 to 10.0. In front of the guys was a revolving pedestal with different stimuli.  First experiment was one girl naked just moving around and the machine would go up to a 4 or 5. Then they had two girls and they got really sexy and the machine went up to a 6 or 7. Ok, this wasn't that funny. When they brought out the fat dude that was slightly balding and no where near packing. This was OVER THE TOP. The guys were all seemingly uncomfortable. They tried not to look and the guy got on the revolving pedestal. The machine started beeping and going crazy. It read 10 plus. The guy taking the study told the dudes taking the study that they were gay. I thought I was going to die. I was laughing so hard here at home and I couldn't get over that.  So, I hope that you people stay nice and cool. Don't die in this heat.  I will post something else when I get to work. I am actually in one of those profound intellectual moods.  Peace
