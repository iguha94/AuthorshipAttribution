************  Official Plug  *************   Just when you thought that the bar could not be raised any further, Emanuel Xavier took the crowd at the Blue Ox Bar to a higher plateau with his polished performance and straight-to-the-heart poetry.  Fresh off his recent appearance on HBO's Def Poetry, Xavier shared poems from both his previous book, "Pier Queen," and work from his most recent publication "Americano."  His feature was an amazing journey through all the dichotomies of Nuyorican life that left the Acentos audience mesmerized throughout.  Not ot be outdone, the Acentos Open Mic was a hotbed of new voices that included Jayme del Rosario, Chance, Al B Back, Betty Leon, Rajao, Hermen Rodriguez, Henry Valentin, Lilah, & John J. Valdes reading alongside louderARTS regulars Raymond Daniel Medina, Holmes McHenry & Roger Bonair-Agard.  Acentos returns this Tuesday, May 27th at 7:00pm with featured poet:  Michele Kotler  ...
