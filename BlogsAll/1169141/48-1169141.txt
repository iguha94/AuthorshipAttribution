Comics, a gated community and a grill   So, I am finally getting over this ebola virus that was killing me. I have no clue if it was a cold or a flu but it took serious toll on me. Yesterday, I had to go to an open house and a workshop and I didnt make nether.  I stood home in the bed until 4pm.  When I did roll out of bed, I made my way to meet up with Eric and Mike to head to PA. We had to go out there to drop off Erics collection of comics. So, for all you comic book enthusiasts out there, I handled over 15 boxes of comics from the early 70s. This dude must have spent every fuckin penny of his allowance when he was young on Comics.  The ride out there was cool because we took Mikes van and it was comfy as a cloud in heaven. I was loving the seats. It was like a recliner in a vehicle.  We got to the community and we had to get approval from Erics MOM to go into the community. It was like a little piece of safe and secure heaven on earth. One thing, it was hill after twist and turn. It was crazy.  When we were headed out there, Eric called the mom and she started getting the grill ready. So after we had all the comics in the spare room. We started cooking the steaks. She diddnt buy the bootleg steaks neither. She got some official Chuck steaks and the BBQ was a blessing. We ate, and ate, and ate.   Great food and a greater time.  Coming home I was aggravated because I was calling somebody and they didnt pick up. I am a worrier but everything turned out ok.  Came home and regardless of being sick, it was a good day to be with Eric. I had a great time and I actually feel better today.  I know, nothing to detailed and it is all general, but hey, thats life when you sick.  My little Ginna and Jayme is sick I hope they get better.   Get better guys.  Peace Love  Take care,  Fish  >)))>
