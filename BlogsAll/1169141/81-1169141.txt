Chuck E. Cheese old school   so,  could tell you that today was a great day. I was at Chuck E-Cheese. Yes, me, geriatric old ass Fish was at Chuck E Cheese playing like a little kid. It was the best too. Best part, I am sitting there eating with these young bucks that I was sitting and who comes up to me????? MY Estranged God daughter!!! She comes up to me and looks at me and says.......... " Hi " . I was shocked. I haven't really interacted with her over the years and that has been my fault. Well, that is a private journal entry. It just felt good to see her and the better part of it was that she came to me to say hello. Life is good.  Pues, by this time, you all probably are aware of how good I felt yesterday about the Rikers Showcase and everything. I was completelystuck on stupid when I left there and my conversation was at a minamal. I had these feelings that I never had before going through my body. I felt like crying 98% of the way home. Oscar was giving some serious accolades and that was one hair fiber from making me pull over and just cry. A loser and failure the majority of my life and now here I am, considered a success in this workshop.  Guys were saying things to me that I never thought I would be on te receiving end of hearing.  I got really attached to them motherfuckers. I hope and wish them the best once they are released. I am not to worried about them fuckin up. I am more concerned about them working hard to become great writers.  Yesterday was the day in which I totally cemented louder in my heart. Roger said some shit at the end of the class that woke me up and left me fucked up. I think that is when it started. I wanted to be alone immediately afterwards but I have responsiblities. So, I kinda shut down and stood quiet. So much was going through my head and I had to let it sink in.  So, we are off to the party today and I should be there by 9pm. I will be in somewhat blouncer mode but I am going to have fun.
