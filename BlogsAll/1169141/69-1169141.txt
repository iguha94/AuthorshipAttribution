Why is my blog like my Penis???   Because if it was ever cut off, I WOULD BE DEVASTATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hola people,   I am back and today's blog will be written by Fish's alter ego of " Sam "   "Hello,         My name is Samuel Vargas and I know all of you have encountered my other half known as " Fish " aka, FishDawg. How did he get a nickname from a nickname is beyond me. I know many of you have never heard of Sam but I will give you a quick synopsis of who Sam is.  I was born in 1971 in NYC, The Bronx. Unlike Fish, I had a great upbringing with two parents that went out of their way to make sure that my life had everything. I was taught to always be polite and respectful to my elders. I tried to always make friends and maintain a proper lifestyle within my neighborhood. I would walk the other way in fights and avoided any and if all confrontations. You know I got beat up alot once they caught up to me. I went to school in NYC and in Texas, unfortunately, Texas was a rough experience for me, the rascism was very explicit and the last straw that my dad took was when we woke up to a swastika spray painted on our front porch. I was really angry but happy we were coming back to New York. When I moved back to NYC, I moved into a building where in the apartment we took used to live " old Man Fish " , this Guy Angel on my Block started calling me " the new fish " and I didn't like that alot. I cried alot when they used to call me The " new Fish ". I even started getting beat up and would go home crying almost everyday. This guy Chauncey was a real bully and he was the one that made me cry the most. This guy Freddy beat me up in the elevator the first day he saw me in the building. This guy papito punched me in the face when we were playing football. Ruben hit me with a bat, Puto hit me with numbchucks, Louie wanted to cut me. Everyone was really picking on me and it hurt me.  "Uh Excuse Sam, Let me tell the rest of this story because you are truly acting like a bitch right now "   " ok Fish "  What's the deal people, you have to excuse Sam because he is still that little bitch nigga that used to get smacked on the regular basis.   You want o know how I came to be?? Easy, all these mothefuckers picking on Sam and making his life a living hell. The one day that I took over during a fight with some kats and I beat this guy to the ground, that is when Sam started getting some respect. You see, it wasnt sam that fought, it was me, FISH!!! Fish was the one that fought and earned his respect. Fish was the one taking lumps for these drunkards. Fish was the one that would always be there for anyone of his boys when they needed him. Fish was the one that fought back against Chauncey, Puto, Ruben, Ray, Pito, John, Boobie, Randy, Jerry, Louie, Hector. These were all Sam's friend but Fish Fought them to get Sam some respect.   You see this guys, Sam is the smart one with the ability to write. That motherfucker takes everything that I have done in life and puts it into that poetry and writing shit that he does. Well, I guess it's a good thing. I am kinda proud of him. Even though Sam is still a bitch.  " Can I say something now Fish? " " nope"  " Ok "  Well, time for Fish to run..... Gotta make believe I am doing some things... Peace, Love  Take care  Chuletas Guisa!!!!  >)))">  Shhhhhhhh..........   " hi again, this is Sam, don't let Fish scare you, he is really a nice guy. Just don't get on his bad side. Bye bye
