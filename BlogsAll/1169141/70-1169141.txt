What do you call a cow with no legs????   GROUND BEEF!!!!!!!  Thank you ladies and gentleman, I will be here all week.  Oh man, good mood, good mood. I have missed you sooo much lately. It has been several days that my moods have been really bad and I tried something new in which  have not " stayed away " from people. It is not as hard as I thought.  Anyway, You know that I am going to talk quickly about Acentos Last night.  I mean quickly in the sense that I will not waste any time.   Acentos was honored last night to have the feature of Cheryl Boyce Taylor. This was easily ( To me ) the most personal and intimate Acentos to date. Cheryl means soo much to not just me but to the scene around her. She has done so much for poetry and to everyone in poetry that we have no room to say it all. Last night I was lucky enough to give her the Outro that she deserved. Where the words came from, I have no clue. I just spoke about the first things that came to me and it proved for a decent moment.   Our resident in Chef Maria took it upon herself to bake a cake for Cheryl. This has no words to describe. Maria probably single handedly made this whole event extremely special. I have to personally just say " Thank you ". After my outro and I asked Maria to present the cake to Cheryl and I pulled out the plates, spoons, ice cream, and The HUGE PUERTO RICAN COOKING SPOON, this was the best show for me in my books. Personally, I went home and just slept and relished that we are doing a good thing.  Oscar was great last night and I have to admit the " Acentos " has it's own personal style. We have cemented that in the eyes of many people that have come through. We have that comfy atmosphere that let's people be themselves. Proof is in the " ex-girlfriend chronicles" that Acentos os famous for. Also, First timers are treated as respectfully welcomed family members. I make sure that whoever is there for the first time knows that I appreciate them coming through.   I was really happy with yesterday's show. I am glad that our usual core audience came through and they did there thing on the open mic. I have to even be THANKFULLLLLL FOR THE POETS THAT COME THROUGH  but they don't read. Ed Garcia is the man on so many levels. He got me 30 Cde's and I have a goal to get rid of them before Nats. I know that is pushing it but we see what we can do.  so, back in sales mode.           5 past 13  A little bit LOUDER: Poetry CD Volume 1 www.louderarts.com/cd You missed HBO Def Poetry Jam ??
