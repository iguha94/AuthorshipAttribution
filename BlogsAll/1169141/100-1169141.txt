Why sooo early?......   ........... cable companies all suck royal eggs. I tell you that someone, somewhere in a galaxy really not that far away has the mental apititude of a newt. They always give the best movies at the worst fucking times. Since I don't sleep, it doesn't bother me, yet, how about all the people that fall asleep early and never have the opportunity to see great flicks. This morning, I woke up about 5am and I was all pissy that I woke up that early. It is too early to watch porn, ok, I saw that movie already!!! sO i START FLICKING. Not me, the remote. Sure enough, they were giving the   The Sandlot !! I loved this movie. It was a cute movie about some young kids playing baseball and they fall into some mischief trying to get a baseball back from a backyard with the biggest dog in the west coast. It was a funny movie. It was a cute movie. It was one of those guilty pleasure flicks that we won't admite we like but deep down inside, we love e,. Kinda like women and porn. They won't admit they watch them, but they have about 5 under the bed.  With that being said " LEnny , CAN I HAVE MY MOVIES BACK?".   So, I had a great weekend. Good quiet Sunday of nothing but just cable and relaxation. I needed one of those, leave me alone days. It always feels good to just be left alone ( Downtime ).    Tonight is my first offical foray into the hosting ring of Bar 13. IT is the Uppercase of Rich, Jai, and Jayme. I am so happy for them. All three are awesome poets and I can't think of anyone else that deserves it more then these three. I am hosting to make sure that this night remains their night. I always had that small resentment that my night was killed. No reason will be given but I always felt that it wasn't " just " for the uppercase. It is all thrown to the wind. I am happy for them and I am seeing them growing and doing their thing.   So, I hope all its well,   Peace, Love, Porkcops.  Fish
