Oh man, you know those little trucks on almost every street corner that sell bagels and all that shit?? well, I brought some doughnut type thingy and it was off the hook. It has chocolate and sugar and everything. Shit, I just noticed, I think I am getting wired. Too much sugar early in the morning will have me on the go.   So people, I have to give you a little insight on me. I want you to get an idea about something that I like.   Many people like to be in the company of others most of the time. I used to be one of those people that was always surrounded day in and out by my boys, homegilrs, and everything else. Thing is, when my life started going south, I spent sooo much time alone that it was peaceful. No drama, no fights, no beef, no advice hunting, no arguments, no nothing. My little safe haven was the penthouse at Perry Ave ( Top floor of an old building actually). I wonder if that will ever change. I like to be alone but I love commitment. I like comittment but I love to be alone. It is hard for me and I have to put things in priority. Thing is, right now is my alone time in my life and it seems best for me now. A relationship for me will not be suited for my mindframe. I also just want to be fair to whomever I decide to be with. I made my mistakes in the past and let them blow up. Now, I am a man and I will take care of everything as righteously possible.  All is good though  Take care  Peace  >)))">
