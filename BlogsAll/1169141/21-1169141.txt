******* WARNING******* WARNING**** WARNING****   The following will ruin any hopes you all have to see the Matrix reloaded without knowing what happened   Good morning folks, I hope that you are all doing well today. I just got to work and I should be tired as fuck but I am not. I am gettting back to my not sleeping days and I feel actually really good. " Sleeping is the cousin of death"  Yesterday was my feature at " Brown Suger " in the Do or die of Bed Stuy. It was a nice experience. I headed out there with my crimee and partner OMX and the evenng proved interesting from the jump. Only in NYC you can be outside a bar rehearsing your poetry and about 13 shots ring out about three blocks away.Since there was a nice thick tree in front of the club, I just  stood behind the tree while too many nosy brothers walked towards where the shooting was. Ok, I have seen my fair share of ghetto antics. From what I know, when there is a shooting, you walk the other way.  Yet, this is NY. This was " BED- STUY"!!!!!!  The open mic was ok if not balh to say the best. Man, going to Bar 13 and seeing these open mic folk, you actually see some good people on the open mic at 13. I felt bad for some of the people that got on that mic and were fooled by the audience ( of course because they don't know any better ) with " shock and awe " with a poem that needed about 4 weeks of workshop. Yet, this is what happens when people are not exposed to some good poetry. The roses are Red and Violets are blue is the only thing they know.   I went up first for my feature and I had a very good time. Don't get me wrong, I made a few little mistakes and I had the carnal sin of letting the audience know that I fucked up at one point. Yet, they were very, very, receptive. I had them laughing, I got several key little messages out. EG: Stay out of trouble        Love the little kids and teach them right        Don't get caught up in some bullshit cause the system sucks After finishing, I got several accolades and I made my exit to the place I call the boogie down. Picked up Roger and Marty at parkchester and headed to the Whitestone.    *********Do not read this part*********  The Matrix was fuckin awesome. Some of the fight scenes were completely mind blowing. The scheme of the movie was a little bit more complicated then the first movie. This was a movie that threw action at you and you also had to go into to understand it. Agent Smith made his return and was funny as fuck for most of the movie. Trinty was awesome. I have a total new found respect for that Keanu Reeves shmuck. I know tha he is not a 9 th degree black belt but I give the guy credit. Some of the things he did ( regardless of the special effects ) require alot of hard work and dedication. Jada Pinkett smith kinda sucked. Well, not sucked, she didn't really have much going in the movie.   At the end of the movie, they showed the next trailer for the " Matrix: Revolutions". This movie is going to break 300 million just this weekend alone.  I say, go see this movie once and maybe consider seeing it twice. The movie is that good.  Ok, on that note.   I shall bid ya ado  Peace  Grease  I'm Out!!
