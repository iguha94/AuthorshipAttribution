weekend stupidity   oh man, I am not much on writing when I could be watching porn but my Laptop has proved worthy of my fingers caressing it's keys. I removed everything except Word and AOL. Tis laptop moves faster then DSL. Ok, Not the point.  I think you might have read my previous entry. I was laying down a wooden floor this weekend and it tested every facet of my moral boundaries. I was tired, aggravated, pissed and every other word to just merely give you the slightest description of 13 hours of pure unadulterated hell. At least I got the floor done and the lady was estactic to say the least.   Ok, So........... I went down to the bowery today to catch Cheryl Boyce Taylor and her Son " Phife Dawg " from a Tribe called Quest. The poetry was off the hook and Phife { if that is even his real name } was really good.  I walked in ans was sprised to see my Dawg " NostraEmus". We hung for about 1 hour and the laughs was more then what I had for the wee. I love that guy.   OMX came across some tickets to the oFF  Broadway show of " Blue Man Group". We headed there for a 5 pm showing and I have to tell you. It had to be the best show of ANYTHING  I have seen this year. The show consisted of Drums, Humor, A SHITLOAD of PAPER streamers!!!! It was merely " off the hook ".  Everything is ok. I went through a small emotional train wreck this afternoon but I Know what is best for me. Fish needs to do Fish.    Oh man, porn time.  Peace
