Culture and bandit    That is the dynamic duo of Rich and Fish. Before you ask, I am the bandit. If you are asking where that came from, it came from seeing Vanessa Hiderig one woman show called " Culture Bandit ". Oh wow, this was a treat and great opportunity.   The invitation was given and I accepted. It was also free!!!!! Zippo fee!!!! Nada en dinero!!!!! As a poet, I am Mr Broke.   I got there a little bit late but I only missed the first five minutes of the show.  Well, Ms Vanessa hidery has shown me something today that I can't really deny. She showed a very personal side in her show that finished a puzzle for me to fully understand her. She literally grabbed me by the hand and took me from 1984 through her current life. She delved into Hip hop, R&B, neighborhood friends, and many instances of the great borough of the Boogie getting mentioned. Her personal battle of being jewish in her upbringing, in a barrio peppered with almost everything besides jewish brethren,  has really made her solid. Her references to her friends and nuances that she has gone through,  were  nostalgic and heart tugging. She had so much in her show that I could relate to,  it made it perfect for my enjoyment. When she started doing the " wop ", I thought I was going to die. When she started busting out all the " Hip hop house " dances, she took me back to " 1018 " when all the thugs played the walls and looked  " hard ".  The best enjoyable moment for me...... ( forgive me V ) but when she said her ass wasn't fat, it was healthy. Damn girl, You need to STOP THAT!!!!!!!!!!  The show was awesome and I would recommend for anyone to go see it at the first opportunity. I didn't take detailed notes but I left there very happy with what I saw.    After the show, we schmoozed with Ricky Cabico and some people from Def Jam.  Who knows what connects were made.   Ok  Let me bounce  peace
