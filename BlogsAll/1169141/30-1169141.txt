Good Morning,   This blogger is going to mean the death of my budding career in Poetry. I tend to just put all my energy into writing in the journal and before you know, Poetry is not being born. All is well with me, I woke up a little while ago and I feel good. I have two workshops that I have to take today and even those seem questionable.   I was reading some of the other bloggers that belong to my brethren. They are truly pushing envelopes. This dude Guy is straight up Gully, ghetto, crazy, doesn't give a flying fuck what any thinks about him or what he writes. I want to grow up just like him. I know he is pretty complex in some ways but the guy is more then a straight shooter. He says it straight and narrow and to the point. He doesn't take three hours to say some thing that you can some up in two words.  Like I mentioned yesterday, I went to go see X-Men with Oscar. The movie was actually really good. I don't want to get bold and say it was better then the first one but it was really really good. A small part of the flick was fucked up on the sound but it was atually kinda funny. It looked like one of those old Chinese voice over flicks.   Well, time for me to ounce out and I will catch you all later. peace  >)))">
