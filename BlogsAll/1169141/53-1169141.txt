HOLA!!!!!!!!!   So, I was about three seconds to getting a heart attack last night. I have gotten so used to my phone never ringing that when it does ring ( after 1 am ) it almost fucking killed me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am watching TV and watching some house show doing a thing on electricity, I was all into it, then the phone rings and I jumped like a piece of hot coal was shoved in my ass.  How are the masses today??? I hope that everyone had a great weekend. Mines was good. Yesterday out of all days, I wanted to come downtown and do some work ( poetry ) in my job. I have this book for the fellas. It is a book specifically penned for prisoners that want to write. So, I am making about  30 copies and handing it out to them. I would have did it yesterday but, 2.5 million Puerto Ricans converged on 5th avenue to celebratetheir heritage, culture, traditions. I used to go to these parades religiously but after being corraled like cattle by the NYPD, I chose to stop going. Plus, My days of going and looking at all these women half naked just doesn't do it for me. I used to go with the intention of getting as many numbers as possible. THen, that went out the window. Then, we used to go to have a good time but we always wound up fighting. So, no more parades for e until I hit the ripe old age of 40. After that, I will go early with a chair, my bottle of pepsi, and my PLAIN FLAG with no silkscreened bullshit, and I will will enjoy the festivities.   So, I will say this ........ Hasta Pasta.....  Peace, Love  Que Se Joda!!!!!!!!!!  Fish  >)))">
