I hate kevin Costner    I just think he sucks as an actor. If Whitney houston was actually Madonna, that movie would have sucked and Kevin Costner would have been a nobody, wait, he is a nobody!!  Is it my imagination or do I write in my blogger more then anybody else that I know?? This is a clear indication that I am a loser. I have no life!!!!!!!!!!!  LOL  Well, yesterday was a good day. Headed out to Rikers and taught with my partner Oscar. Everything went well. The class was extremely attentive yesterday and they broke down a poem almost as perfect as seasoned writers would have.  Little by little, I keep on hearing their little stories of the everyday life of the Rikers system. Yesterday, some inmate was knocked out by a C.O. They knocked his teeth out because he made a comment that the lakers got waxed ( beat badly ). One punch from the C.O and the inamte goes down and 6 of his teeth hit the floor. Makes ya wonder who is worst in Rikers, either the inmates or the C.O's.  After Rikers, Oscar was suppose to go to a Birthday shindig but it was cancelled and he was free. So, with that being said, I have been dying to go to Brooklyn to a small little ecuadorian spot for some " ceviche ". Last night, I made it there. I was so fucking happy eating  "shrimp in warm lemon broth. On a bed of warm white rice, with a hint of Cilantro" . I love IT!!!!!!!  Life is good.  :)  Peace
