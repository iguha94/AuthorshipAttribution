2 more visits......   ....... That is all I need. After today, I just need two more visits to my Parole officer and I am an official free man. Yea, I admit it to all of those that think I am a goodie two shoe poet. I have been on parole for the last five years paying for a crime I did commit. I am not screaming  " Not guilty ". I did it ( copped a plea ) and I paid with plenty. So, after October 7th, I am going to have an " I AM FREE " blog posted that very same day. Most of my peeps ( Criminals ) say that as soon as I finish parole that I will probably get in trouble. Uh, no way in fucking hell that is going to happen.  I am just going to keep writing, reading, and absorbing the incredible talent I have surrounded myself with.  It is best for me to say that I had both feet submerged in the gutter. With both feet wet, I shuffled into poetry and just wrote about what has been going on in my life. It's a beautiful thing.   Here is a thought. I have a criminal record and I want to teach. Would it be possible??? It is going to be hard as hell but I will be able to do something. I might not be able to teach for the Board of Education but I can outsource my services. I am teaching at Rikers again on September 19th for 16 weeks. I am taking a teacher training program to become a teaching artist. Life is getting really interesting. Shit, I am going to be in charge of two interns during the rikers Foray. That should be fun. Having two individuals that probably never even walked passed a jail.  Oh well, time to go and do my thing.   I am ok people, just kinda enjoying this alone time  Peace, Love, Off to see the Parole man  Porkchops
