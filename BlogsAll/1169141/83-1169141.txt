Boxers or Briefs????    " Hi, my name is Sam and I wear hot pink things"   What's the deal people!!!!!! I am back in the job and I am doing great. This morning, I am riding to work and I am reading the Daily news and I come acorss those " Dear Abby " type columns. The girl was writing because she was losing alot of friends because of her on line journal ( Blog ). Wow, I never heard of an on-line journal. I never even knew that you could do that. Anyway, This girl was losing friends because of the things that she was writing. Her anti-war views and everything else were putting her in awkwards positions. I say this........     Dear girl that is losing friends because of her blog "                  If your friends read your blog and they decide to cut you off, those were not real friends. If you can not have your own views without having those people judge you, you don't need them. You need people in your life that will accept your views for what they are , YOUR Views. They dont have to agree with them, but they can accept you. So, all in all, FUCK em!!!!     Last night, I got an invite to the Nuyorican. I was tired and not really digging the fact that I would be getting another night of a two hour sleep cycle. Here is the kicker, I had this feeling that it would be a good thing to just go. Sure enough, I did not regret it. They started the slam early because a PBS production company was there recording the slam. After the slam, special performances by Willie Perdomo, Mayda DeValle, Slanty eyed Mama, Danny Hoch. I was in Poetry heaven for five bucks. Well, actually, more like poetry purgatory because the cd recording at 13 was off the hook and no show has come close to that!!!!  The slam was good and it was good to see different voices on the mic. Out of 20 slammers, I only knew one. That is a good thing. Carlos Gomez, one of the members of nuyorican 2003 team was there and he took first in the slam. Yet, he did the admirable thing and gave up the slot because he already made the team. So, keeping this crown would have been worthless because he couldn't be on the team again. So, some white guy named " Lamb " took second and the opportunity to take part in a friday slam. As the vulture that I am , I got Carlos info for some things I would like for him to do.   All in all, Willie Perdomo is a hands down master at what he does. I can't explain how a simple changing of the tone of your voice will bring a poem to life. Mayda did her thing and she is so awesome. Funny thing, I didn't go and say hello. I met Mayda about 6 times and that connection is still lacking. She did her thing and she is truly an awesome poet. As I am writing this, I am noticing something that many of you probably already have noticed. I tend to give my dues and props to all poets who are of Latino descent. I can't even deny this. When I first started coming to this scene, I felt that there were not enough latino voices around. That of course changed with Oscar breaking down doors, me following suit, and many others after me. I have nothing against a poet who is not latino but I will support my Hispanic brethren as hard as I could. I can tell you that there are some latino poets that will make it big. They have their own style, way with words, and a dedication to getting to the top. Mark my words, watch for a selected few.  So, with last names like Bermeo, Gonzalez, Villar, Rojas, Perdomo, Rojas have ,and ,will go down as awesome latino poets.   So, my day is here and I am good. We have one day to practice for Team Acentos taking on the powers that be on Monday. I can't wait, it is going to be fun. I would love to beat them. Yet, I would love to just have fun and practice to get better.  On that wonderful ecclectic notes  Time to bounce  Peace, Love  Take care  Fish ( I am a proud, strong, latino man ) Dawg  p.s did I ever mention that I do have a hot pink thong fetish???   That is a whole other blog!!!!!!!
