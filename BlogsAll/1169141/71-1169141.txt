where are our priorities   Heaven sent voice has gifted us with 54 years of happiness 77 years of a life worthy of books An angel sings hearty rhythms with a spanish flare Fire in her blood Melody in her heart Culture and tradition her spirit We mourn her silence We suffer our loss Heavens gain their voice that we borrowed  Silence  Rounded face children crying for what they don't know Older women crying for the lost of a friend a staple a person that has come into our life through music Politicians, musicians, entrepeneurs all under the facets of " mourning " 2 horses agitated by the noise I carriage adorned with flowers and the cuban flag Where can we be righteous? Dignify in death as they have lived in life  Vendors sullying the memory of a legend selling Cuban flags Older men carrying boxes of sugar to throw on spectators yelling " Celia wants you " Shirts emblazoned with the face of " La Reina " sold for 20 dollars La Mega 97.9 giving out paper fans as memento's 93.1 following suit Now is not the time Or is it??? Not one corporate sponsor No bustello No Goya No El Pico  Our Mayor under the rain and annoyed by the lack of a proper umbrella Wails of " Celia , We love you ",AZUCAR, and the robust, " Que decanse in Paz " What is this for ? Have you loved her in life? Have you honored her correctly in death? For a funeral is to mourn, cherish, and remember. Was I here to mourn the funeral procession of a legend? or Was I here to enthrall myself in the circus of media hords?  Fish  Note: What I saw today really bothered me.
