Seafood and Penne Vodka with ChickeN!!!!!!!!!!!   Oh man, you all know that I can not deny good food. Party, BBQ, Dinner, Sandwich, even a trip to White Castle will make a brotha chops quiver. I know when I was young, I wasn't a fan of seafood. Through the years the age grew with the experimenting of different foods. My first love is steak and seafood runs about a quarter length right behind it.  The best seafood is a broiled lobster tail, you can't go wrong with that. Wait, add a steak to the side of that lobster tail and you are heaven bound. Funny thing about seafood is that mythologically, it is an aphrodisiac ( don't even ask me if I even tried to spell that word right ). Seafood ( especially oysters ) will have your hormones all out of wack. You could have been just chillin with no hint of sexual frusttrations at all. Once you throw some oysters in the body, even that local crackhead around the block collecting cans is looking kinda sexy. So, here is what I think.......  Before oysters                                   After Oysters Won't touch Joan rivers                      I will make her squeal like a mule Babara Walters                                  In leather, she will get DONE Fat chic from the  "facts of life "           I would record it for prosperity Mrs Garret                                        One word " Threesome " Leona Helmsley                                  ANAL ALL THE WAY BABY!!!!!  Shit, people better hope that I won't get oysters in my systerm and then get locked up with them before a sexual release.  Man , woman or a child three days short of an 18th birthday will get sooooo sexually violated that it is not even remotely funny.   Anyway, I am to battle traffic.  Peace, Love,   Take care  Fishdawg  Chuletas and rice baby!!!
