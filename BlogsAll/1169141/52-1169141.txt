Awesome feature and destruction on the head to head   So, if your little feet ddin't take you to Bar 13 yesterday, you missed out on one of the best Monday's in a long time. I will tell you about the feature first:  Yesterday, Cheryl Boyce Taylor was our feature at Bar 13. This lady has no words to describe her. She has been there 85% of the time when we needed encouraging words about our poetry. She is a friend, teacher, Mother, poet, Writer, and posseses a heart that will make platinum blush. Her words are deep and powerful but paintbrushed with a soft outside to enter our minds gently. She has a talent and honed skill that undoubtedly makes her special. She was nervous with no need to be as to everyone was focused on her and every word she had to say. I had to sacrifice about ten minutes of her feature to make sure that we could convey our appreciation of her in the form of a dozen roses and one sunflower. The roses that were blooming were significant of what LouderARTS is. The sunflower reperesented what cheryl is to us. I know it was kinds sappy but I am man enough to say that she is special and has touched many people. I am not only happy that I know her, I am honored to have her as a friend.  The open mic was once again an array of interest. We had our LouderEDGE format and several poets were up there putting it all out. I had to give my opinion ( it is only that ) to Amanda ( I am not even going to spell her last name because it would be a total travesty if I fucked it up ). She had a great poem about to lesbians in NYC and many images of what they had to go through. The payoff at the ending was very sweet. She brought it home very nicely and there wasn't much critique I could have given her.I just suggested giving the Piece more personality. Maybe adding two names to the two people. Yet, after hearing the piece, it would take away from the payoff. I had to also critique Youlanda on her piece. Once again, her piece was too short and her metaphor left me hanging.  She needs to explore deeper into her writing and pull out much more vivid images to make her poem pay off.  Off the tope of my head, Rich ( In which is getting a good spot in my heart), Chance ( Hardest working man in Poetry ), that is all I remember??? Damn, I need to start smoking weed to remember shit.  After our open mic, wow, our head to head slam bout between Tai Freedom Ford -vs- Celena Glenn.   5 rounds of Poetry between two serious heavyweights. My loyalties are with Bar 13 but damn, Celena is off the hook. Yet, rooting for Tai I went.  First round was the coke classic round in which they said there classic poem Second round was the Goddess of My desire round in which a poem by their favorite poet was read Third round was If Bob Marley was a lesbian round in which I have no fucking clue what is was suppose to be Fourth round was the Improv round in which words from the audience were used in an improve poem Fifth round was the anything goes round in which anything goes. Let me go over the highlights that makes it interesting.  Tai killed it in the first round with her coke classic Poem. IF I was worth something, I would know the name of that poem. So, as of now, I am a piece of shit.  Now, Celena took Homeland ( credit Marty ) and she spun that sucker into her own rendition. It was funnet but that poem needs energy and bringing to a low overtone might have killed her. Then again, I don't know shit.  IF the Bob Marley was a lesbian round lost me as soon as they mentioned it, so, no need to write about that.  Let me run straight into the anything goes round.  Tai went up there and kept it to Poetry in didn't make it into a debacle. Now, her is where I will insert my opinion  ( insert Fish Opinion here )  Celena went up there with a whole bunch of people ( Shawn Randall,  plus 3 ). This is where I thought that the poetry lost it's edge. Celena got some serious freestyling skills. I heard her and I was looped. Then, her Partner Shawn throws up the mic and spits some lyrics and it just couldn't compare. I have always defended that dude when it came down to his poetry freestyling, now, after hearing him on par with Celena, I don't know.He decided to  throw a barb at the 13 crew about nationals. Unfortunately, we have much more to worry about then some inconsequential jolts of nonsense. I am a believer in karma and even addressing it is much more then a waste of my time. Barbs and disses don't count. Let's talk after nationals.  So, behold this news.......  Tai Freeedom Ford.............  4 Rounds Celena Glenn..................... 1Round  Tai Freedom Ford is June 9th Head to Head Champ!!!!  So, let me see....... Taylor -vs- Roger        Roger wins ( Bar 13 ) Cristin - vs - Marty      Marty Wins ( Bar 13 ) Shappy -vs - Guy        Shappy wins ( Urbana ) Tai -vs- Celena            Tai ( Bar 13 )  I won't even tally up the scores.  Headed to the oval and ate the best cheesburger on this side of the fucking planet. I was so hungry that I wanted to lick the plate.  So, kiss the mini moolie  Peace  Fish  >)))">
