I hate computer glitchs!!!!!!!   Man, I am writing this for a second time. I wrote a whole shpiel and tried to publish it on my blog and it decides to play bellvue on me.  Well, here goes again. Last night, I have decided to remove my  “ pimp “ hat and bow down to the true master of “pimpdom”. My buddies roomate is merely off the hook. That guy was dancing and kicking it with every single female at the party. Sir, I bow down to you and see you as my mentor.  The party was off the hook.
