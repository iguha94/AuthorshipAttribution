Please help me!!!!   I was forced into the world of "    Superman  " while trying to avoid the "   Great American Scream Machine " of "   MEDUSA " while she was almost killed by a " Runaway Train ". One of Medusa's " Vipers" spit some poisionous "   NITRO " onto "   Batman  " when he was trying to save me but "   Batman and Robin  " from the Chiller prooved worthless.  Did I do well????? I tried to described all the major rides that almost killed me today.   Yes, my old geriatric ass made a trek to Great adventures today. My buddy called me late last night and as spontaneous as we can be, at 9am this morning, we were in Great adventures. I know I know, it was stupid to go on a weekend and a holiday one at that. Well, for your funky little information, Great Adventures was as empty as a crack whores black book trying to find a job. Nobody was there compared to the times when I usually go. From 10am to 12:30, we already have jumped on all the rides that I have mentioned. the only ride where I waited for 15 minutes was the " Superman " ride. Which was completely crazy to let you know. Hands down, " Nitro " was still the best ride in length and excitment. The ride that had me shocked was that " Viper "!!!! This thing was choppy and it was just throwing me all over the place!!!!!!!! Hence, maybe that is why they call it the " viper ".  I couldn't get over at how empty this park was. We were just walking up to all the rides and just basically walking in and jumping on. I think this is the only time that I am kinda digging this recession. Great Adventures is expensive as fuck folks. Make sure you get those coupons and coke cans and go during the week. Maybe that is why it was empty. It was a beautiful thing just walking on and not waiting on those welfare lines ( FLASHBACKS!!!!!!!!!!!!).  So, time for me to shower and do my thing. I am the early shift this week at work.  Time to go.  Peace,  FishDawg  >)))">    Peace.
