We've known for a while now that Cornelius Fudge and the other top-level bureaucrats at the Ministry of Magic were nothing more than Soviet-style apparatchiks, men who know just two kinds of people--enemies and underlings.  We knew  that  back at the end of book four when Fudge stuck his head in the sand after Dumbledore, Snape and Potter presented incontestible proof that Lord Voldemort was back.  Now we also know how utterly incompetent they are.  Consider this article ripped from the pages of The Daily Prophet (chapter twenty-five in  The Order of the Phoenix , so if you haven't read this far you might not want to read this post):   The Ministry of Magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from Azkaban.  Speaking to reporters in his private office, Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, confirmed that ten high security prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening, and that he has already informed the Muggle Prime Minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals.   So Fudge wants Tony Blair to be on the lookout for Death Eaters?  Tony Blair has been the Mayor of Basra for two months, and he has yet to find a single weapon of mass destruction!  How's he going to track down a bunch of serial-killing   wizards   on the lam?  If only our heroes were Californians rather than British.  Then they could   recall  Fudge.
