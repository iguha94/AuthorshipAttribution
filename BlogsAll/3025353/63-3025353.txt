The blog is slowly getting into shape.  I'm not happy with the colors, and I have yet to pay Blogger fifteen bucks to get rid of the banner ad, but we're making progress.  Question is, How seriously do I want to take this blog?  The time I spend fiddling with the template is time I could be spending reading or doing something else worthy of commenting on in my blog.  Alas, style is triumphing over substance.    I'm adding links of interest to my side bar.  Please note the new "Favorites" category.  The favorite theologians are not, strictly speaking, theologians.  One's a farmer, and the other's a composer.  Yet, in the words of Karl Barth, a genuine, bona-fide theologian (and a dead, German-speaking one at that):  "We can even dare to say that every Christian - in however primitive and rudimentary a way - can and must be a theologian, and that no matter how primitive and rudimentary he can and must be a good theologian, having a true vision of the One in whom he believes, having true thoughts concerning him and finding the right words to express those thoughts."  (Thanks to the   Scandal of Particularity  blog for the quote.)  So why can't a crazy man from the Bluegrass state who still plows his fields with mules be a theologian?  And as for the composer--all I can say is that nobody can make you feel sorry for your sins and absolutely adore Jesus like Mr. J.S.B.  More favorites are to come.  As soon as I decide which novel is, in fact, my favorite, I'll add that category.  One category that's sure to debut soon is  "Favorite Maudlin 80s Pop Single."  You'll see it as soon as I find a link to the lyrics of Spandau Ballet's "True."  Yes, I admit it.  Are you man enough to admit that you can't get "Wanna Be Starting Something" out of your head?
