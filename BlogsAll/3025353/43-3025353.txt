In the runup to the war on Iraq , the Bush administration consistently appealed to the most pessimistic appraisal of Iraq's ties to terrorists and its capacity to wield weapons of mass destruction, and consistently trotted out the rosiest scenarios for rebuilding the country in the war's aftermath.  Since the war the administration has been proven wrong on both counts.  U.S. forces have discovered no biological, chemical or nuclear agents, and U.S. forces have been unable to restore order to Iraq.  The electricity is still out; the oil is not flowing, and a well-organized guerrilla campaign has killed or wounded more Americans since the war technically ended on May 1.   Nonetheless, we've made this bed, and we're going to have to lie in it.  I'm not suggesting that we get out of Iraq, as   International ANSWER will  in a march in Washington this fall.  We're stuck, and we've got to try to make it work.  So I welcome the President's straight talk last night:  $87 billion to rebuild Iraq; no timetable for the departure of U.S. troops; and new willingness to seek international solutions to the problems in Iraq.  Still, the President could have been straighter with us.  He could have said, "We were wrong."    Better yet, he could have said, "We knew things would likely go this way, but we decided not to tell you going in because you never would have gone along with it, but we knew that once we were in, you'd have no choice but to stand with us," a statement that's probably closer to the truth.    Just as criticizing the administration's war rationale doesn't mean I think we should get out now, so too thinking that we shouldn't get out now doesn't mean I think this administration ought to run the rebuilding effort any longer than necessary.  They've lied, exaggerated and bungled enough to be shown the door next November.
