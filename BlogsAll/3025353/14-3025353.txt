Democrats are making hay over the whopping $450 billion federal deficit.  Shame on them.  Thee's nothing wrong with running a deficit in tough economic times.  Should the government really be racking up surplus tax revenue at a time when millions of people are losing their jobs?  Good ol' John Maynard Keynes taught us that the government can use fiscal policy to steer the economy between the rock of recession and the hard place of inflation.  When the economy slows, the government ought to prime the pump with deficit spending.  Later, when the economy heats up, the government can tap the breaks by raising taxes and cutting spending.  Democrats to a person are Keynesians.  Their carping about the deficit is disingenuous.  It's also poor politics.  The deficit is not a viable campaign issue.  Just ask deficit hawks Walter Mondale, Paul Tsongas and Ross Perot.    The real issue, from a policy and a political perspective, is where the red ink is flowing.  Democrats ought to contend that instead of giving the surplus back to the wealthy in the form of tax cuts, the surplus ought to have been spent on, well... you name it.  Bailing out cash-strapped states.  A real prescription drug benefit for senior citizens.  Making affordable health care insurance available to more Americans.    Do us a favor, Democrats, and give us a national debate on the best way to stimulate the economy.  It's either the President's way, cutting taxes to spur investment, or your way, increased spending on social programs like health care and education.  But let's have a real debate over real issues, not political hay-making.
