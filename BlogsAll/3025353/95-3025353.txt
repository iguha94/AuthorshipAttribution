I was raking up pine straw in the yard yesterday when the UPS truck stopped.  I had to sign for a thin package addressed to my wife.  Hoo-boy!  My Christmas present!  I thought.  Even better.  Laura entered a Kelloggs sweepstakes a few weeks ago.  The letter in the package informed us that we have won a trip to a really big American city and a fistful of frequent flyer miles.  And they aren't even U.S. Airways miles!  BUT... they want us to fill out all these forms, get them notarized, and return them pronto.  Is this legit?  We have to scrutinize the fine print.  I've actually won a couple of things in my life.  In college I called into a morning radio show,   WRDU  I think, answered two out of three questions correctly, and won two tickets to a Doobie Brothers concert.  Laura heard me on the radio.  We weren't dating at the time, and sad to say, my radio trivia prowess did nothing to raise her interest in me beyond the dreaded "good friend" level.  I had to work the night of the concert, so I gave the tickets to the RA downstairs, Kinlaw.  Man, I haven't thought of him in a long time.  My most vivid memory of Kinlaw is him staggering into my dorm room one night drunk out of his mind.   The traffic gate that used to be affixed to the security guard post outside   Syme Dorm  was under his arm.  It seems that the arm had called Kinlaw an obscenity, and he wasn't going to take it lying down.  Later I won two tickets to the Columbia, Missouri Symphony Orchestra.  I had hurt my back, and was in bed when the radio said, Be the third caller, and I was!  (You don't often hear that kind of thing on a classical music station--except during their pledge drive--but   KBIA  is different, I guess).  This time Laura was my date, and she was my wife to boot!  Guess I need to start listening to the radio more...
