Seth Holtzman, who teaches philosophy at Catawba, invited me to speak to his Environmental Ethics class about religion and the environment.  He was nice enough to share some of the course readings that pertained specifically to religion and environmental ethics.  Not surprisingly, the Jewish authors had the best stuff.  Why?  Their ethics rise out of a close reading of Biblical texts.  They don't posit a vague definition of "justice," and then apply that to the environment, as liberal Protestants do.  I've often thought that liberal Protestants need to learn to read the Bible more like Jews in order to return to the  sola scriptura  Reformation spirit.  But now I'm off the track...  Anyway, one thing that Christians can learn from Jews about the environment is a proper interpretation of Genesis 1:28.  What does it mean that humans "have dominion" over the earth?  That we can dispose of the environment as we see fit?  Some do take the scripture to mean just that--a license to rape, loot and pillage.  "Dominion," however, is a political term.  The medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides pointed out that kings exist in order to restrain theives from breaking in and stealing.  Exercising dominion over the creation, then, means RESTRAINING the exploitation of the earth.  Using Genesis 1:28 to authorize human domination of the planet is an abuse of the text and our authority.  We become to the planet what Robert Mugabe, Saddam Hussein or Augusto Pinochet are to their people, tyrants whose exercise of political authority is merely organized thuggery.  Thus, Factoid One is:  Dominion does not equal Domination.  Dominion equals Defending the Creation.
