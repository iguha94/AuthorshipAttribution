Teen Sex .   Now there's a topic worth pontificating on.  I haven't had a chance to write the word "salacious" since impeachment.  This morning's   Charlotte Observer  announced that some teenage girls are (gasp!) acting like boys, aggressively seeking sexual encounters with no emotional strings attached.  We all knew that, right?  These girls today--nothing but a bunch of freak dancin' hoochie mommas.  Except that the article went on to note that overall teen sexual behavior is down, from 55% to less than 50%.  The number of teen girls with four or more sexual partners is down from 18% to 14%.  But those mitigating factors were located on the other side of the jump.  So if teens are having less sex, why write an article trumpeting the few who are giving Sadie Hawkins a bad name?  You know the answer, Gentle Reader.  Sex sells.  Our article in question had seven instances of the phrase "oral sex," (a post-impeachment record?)  The banner on the front page advertizing the article featured two hot (like, soap opera hot) kids on the verge of attacking each other's lips.  (Although the article assured us, at least seven different times, that the sexual contact in question was not lip-to-lip.)  What would the graphics look like for a banner saying, "Teens abstaining from sex--See Living Section"?  Some wholesome, home-schooled girl in a gingham dress?  Yawn.  Well, the good news is that a lot of teenagers are getting the message--from parents, teachers, houses of worship, the difficult lives of older brothers and sisters--that delaying sexual activity is in their best interest.  No matter what MTV and BET are trying to tell them.  And no matter what The salacious Charlotte Observer is trying to tell you.
