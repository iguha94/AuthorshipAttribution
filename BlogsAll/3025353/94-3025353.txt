We finally saw Reloaded last night.  Does anyone in the Blogosphere think that Zion looks an awful lot like Isengard after Saruman wrecked the place?  I can't blame that bald guy in the first movie for wanting to forget everything.  Nope.  Can't blame him at all.  Is that the Shroud of Turin on the   Bell South home page ?  No, it's the Lord Aragorn.  That got me thinking.  There are actually two Messiah figures in  The Lord of the Rings .  Frodo is the suffering servant, the one who bears a terrible burden to free the world.  Aragorn is the eschatological Christ who "comes in glory to judge the quick and the dead, and of his kingdom there will be no end."    Ralph Wood's The Gospel According to Tolkien  is on my to-read list.  I wonder if he explores Messianism in the Rings trilogy.  The  Christian Century  ran an excerpt of the book in a recent issue.  There Wood notes that Tolkien's work diverges from the Norse and Greek myths that inspired him in his treatment of pity.  For the ancients, pity was bestowed only on worthless, pathetic creatures.  To show pity to an enemy was considered perverse.    Yet Tolkien's characters repeatedly pity their enemies.  "Pity stayed Bilbo's hand," to quote Gandalf, when he had a chance to kill Gollum with the Ring of Power.  Frodo too shows mercy to Gollum, despite the latter's treachery and all around loathsomeness.  Only because the dangerous Gollum is pitied does the epic not end in disaster.  That pity, not courage or brutality or fate, drives the Rings trilogy distinguishes Tolkien from the bards of old as a Christian writer.  In a world of "No Fear" bumper stickers, governed by leaders who promise to "rid the world of evildoers," is there any room for pity?  If not, shall our epic end in anything other than disaster?  No.  There may yet be much suffering, but I believe that our epic is in the hands of one who pities his enemies.  It's not in the hands of the evildoers, or the ones who would rid the world of them.
