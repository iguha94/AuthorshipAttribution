I mentioned taking in Pippen, didn't I?  The sets and costumes were anachronistic and fun.  I can't wait to see Eric Abbott to ask him what was churning in his mind when he created   those costumes .  The denim jackets with the anarchy symbol took me back to the smoking patio in high school, but the bare midriffs were definitely turn of the millenium.  Think "Brittney Spears goes to the Headbanger's Ball."  Plot summary:  Charlemagne's son Pippen is dissatisfied with life.  He wants a "meaningful," exciting life.  He becomes a soldier, but that life's really more for his father and brother.  Next he tries his hand at debauchery, and then politics, and then domestic living.  Nothing satisfies, until the end when Pippen must choose between going out in a blaze of glory or the extraordinariness of an ordinary life.  "The extraordinariness of an ordinary life."  In Pippen's case, it's fixing a leaky roof and consoling a little boy when his pet duck dies.  (The actress playing the dying duck stole the show.  I hope I see her in the movies one day.)    How I wish I'd seen this play twelve years ago!  I'd have saved myself a lot of existential angst.  I have slowly learned that you don't have to be on the barricades somewhere to do the Lord's work.  Just trying to react calmly to an autistic toddler is more than enough "peace and justice" work for one day.
