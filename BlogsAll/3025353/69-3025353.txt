Our younger son is named for an apostle.  Sadly, the gospels give Andrew the Galilean fisherman short shrift.  About all that we know of him is that he was Simon Peter's brother.  I was pleased to see his name crop up in yesterday's   gospel lesson , and I'm happy to report that a book I'm skimming has filled in a few missing details about now our second-born's namesake.    In   Eastern Orthodoxy Through Western Eyes , author   Donald Fairbairn  states that in his missionary work in the former Soviet Union he heard numerous stories about the "facts" that the apostles Andrew and Simon the Zealot preached the gospel in Georgia in the first century.  The Ukranians fondly remember Andrew as well.  It is said that he journeyed to the hills on which the city of Kiev would be built and blessed them.  Some Ukranians also believe that a cathedral in Kiew was built by God the Father himself at the request of the Virgin mary shortly after the creation of the world.  So it looks like we still know very little about the Apostle Andrew, and a lot more about the wishful thinking of Georgian and Ukranian Orthodox Christians.  Sigh.    Still, I may yet encourage my younger son to major in Russian, go to work for the State Department or some multi-national corporation, and "find himself" in the former Soviet Union if he can't find himself here.  Or maybe I'll simply encourage him to read more Dostoevsky.
