I surprised myself the other day.  I walked out of Blockbuster with the   8 Mile   DVD.  I know as much about Eminem as most over 30 people do, which is to say that I'm appalled by the gross, misogynistic lines he raps.  But I'd overheard a person or two say that   8 Mile   wasn't a bad movie, and I wouldn't have expected that opinion from those people.  Plus, the theme song got quite a lot of airplay earlier this year, and I'd grown to like it (it was fairly clean by Eminem standards).  So I took a chance.  To tell the truth, it's a pretty good "inspirational story" genre movie.  Eminem plays himself--a role that suits him well.  Like Keanu Reeves, Eminem has got two facial expressions down pat--dumbfounded and determined.  He's broke.  His friends are losers, harmless, but losers.  He's had to move back in with his mother (Kim Basinger) who's getting it on with a guy Eminem went to high school with.  (An aside--why is it that everyone in motion pictures who lives in a trailor has a southern accent, even in Detroit?)  Girls two-time him.  Big-mouthed "agents" betray him.  Thugs beat him up.  But thanks to hard work, and trusting no one but himself, Eminem exorcises his demons and triumphs at the end.  The way he turns the tables on his competition can only be described as an excellent example of Pauline "boasting in weakness" (see 2 Corinthians 10-13).    8 Mile   is not not a clean movie, but the music is actually free of the grime that landed Eminem in such hot water in the leadup to the Grammy Awards a few years ago.  In fact, there's one scene where the notoriously homophobic Eminem comes to the defense of a gay co-worker with a few well-chosen lines.  Check it out.
