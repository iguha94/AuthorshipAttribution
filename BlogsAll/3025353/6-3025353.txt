The new Harry Potter book is due out in a couple of weeks.  Just now I'm picking up the first one in the series.  There are nine-year-olds who've forgotten more about Harry Potter than I'll ever know.  I'm humbled.  What can I say about Harry Potter that hasn't already been said?  Probably nothing, so I'll simply report my first impressions.  It's not politically innocent fiction--no good fantasy story ever is.  Harry's evil relatives are mean, materialistic TV watchers.  Sound familiar?  If it's true that there is one Harry Potter book in print for every four Americans, do we realize that the joke's on us?  Now I'm wondering who the "wicked step-sisters" in Cinderella really were.  This text seems important in defining the moral vision of Harry Potter:   Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him.  Very strange strangers they were, too.  A tiny man in a violet top hat bowed to him once while he was out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley...  A wild-looking old woman dressed in all green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.  A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word.   The very strange (and scorned) among us are actually gifted with extraordinary powers.  Imagine:  every old fool muttering to himself has a flying broom in the closet at home; every bag lady can turn into a cat, and every picked on kid is a wizard in disguise.  Of all us earthen vessels, the cracked ones hold the greatest treasure.
