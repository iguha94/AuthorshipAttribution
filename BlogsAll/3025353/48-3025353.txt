Now that the   Friends 4 Friends  dinner is behind us, and The Two Towers is out on DVD and video, my fantasy interests have turned from Potter back to Tolkien's trilogy.   I spent Labor Day weekend reading  The Return of the King .  The first time through I read at a breakneck pace, so desperate was I to discover the fate Mr. Frodo and the Ring of Power.  This time around I'm proceeding at a more leisurely pace, leisurely enough to accomodate a dictionary at my side.  Tolkien was a philologist by trade, so he was quite a wordsmith, and not only when it came to inventing an elven language as background for his Middle Earth epic.  He can handle English pretty well too.  I'm learning a lot of new words.   Fey , for instance, which means "fated to die soon," or "sensing imminent death."  It may also mean, "appearing as if under a spell:  Enchanted."  Then there's the word  fell , used as an adjective.  "Inhumanly cruel," it means, or "capable of destroying."  Not to mention "sharp and biting."  Tolkien returns to these words in the grim pages of  The Return of the King  because, though the men of Gondor and the Riders of Rohan survive many fell blows from the servants of Sauron, fey is their mood as they increasingly realize the magnitude of the power arrayed against them.  Now, to work these wonderful words into my pedestrian writing.  How's this?   A fey cloud gathered in the office of Tommy Bowden after the fell Bulldogs cruelly defeated the Tigers upon the gridiron floor of the Valley called Death.  The shoe contract, the summer coaching clinic, the prestigious coaching job at a historic football school, all crumbling into dust, like the slag sliding down the face of the Ered Luthui, the very teeth of Mordor.    Not bad, eh!  I can't wait to call up the   Packman  this afternoon and let that one fly!
