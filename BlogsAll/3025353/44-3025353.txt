A Sunday evening miscellany...  The right says that Howard Dean is too hot.  Guess what?  They also say that   John Kerry is too cold .  When will the settle on a Democrat that's just right?  Don't hold your breath.    I warned you about Wake Forest .  Here, Tolkien has convinced me that I should remain a small church pastor:       Already the Ring tempted him, gnawing at his will and reason.  Wild fantasies arose in his mind; and he saw Samwise the Strong, Hero of the Age, striding with a flaming sword across the darkened land, and armies flocking to his call as he marched to the overthrow of Barad-dur.  And then all the clouds rolled away, and the white sun shone, and at his command the vale of Gorgoroth became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit.  He had only to put on the Ring and claim it for his own, and all this could be.        In that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped him most to hold firm; but also deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain hobbit sense:  he knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough to bear such a burden, even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him.  The one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a garden swollen to a realm; his own hands to use, not the hands of others to command.   And speaking of Tolkien, I found another word,   puissant  .  It means powerful, as in, "You desired the love of Aragorn.  Because he was high and puissant..." said Faramir to Eowyn.  "But you lost out to an Elf chick.  And I'm about to be dethroned as Steward of Gondor, a title I've held but mere days.  We're a couple of also-rans to the thoroughbreds in this epic.  Hey, we're made for each other!"  So the not-as-puissant-as-Aragorn Faramir wed the not-as-concupiscible-as-Arwen Eowyn.  And they lived reasonably happily ever after.  (The rest of that paragraph was me, not Tolkien.  I'm still trying to find my saga-like writing voice.  And you'll have to look up  concupiscible  yourself.)
