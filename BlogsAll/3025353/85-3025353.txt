I grew up in Fayetteville, North Carolina, best known for its close proximity to Fort Bragg, home of the 82nd Airborne Division.  Units of the 82nd are seeing a lot of action in Iraq.  They are occupying portions of the so-called Sunni Triangle, a hotbed of anti-American guerrilla activity.  Author Thomas Wolfe, born at the other end of North Carolina, wrote a book titled  You Can't Go Home Again .  That's been my unofficial motto for thinking about my hometown.  I'd long since concluded that my peculiar views on Christian nonviolence would make me unemployable anywhere near the Fayetteville city limits.  But my new   Christian Century  arrived in the mail today, and I was put to shame.  A little article in their news section detailed the work of Fayetteville's   Quaker House  .  These pacifist Christians are making an effective witness for peace in one of the more thoroughly militarized regions of the country.  Quaker House affiliates regularly protested against the Iraq War.  At present they assist soldiers who are leaving the army on conscientious objector grounds.  They also offer a listening ear to family and friends who are scared to death about the plight of relatives who've been deployed to Iraq.  It was rough going in March, according to the  Christian Century  article, but as the occupation has soured, Quaker House workers are finding that community support of their mission is rising.  Maybe I can't go home again, but that doesn't mean that the gospel isn't being proclaimed in Fayetteville, NC.  Thank God it doesn't depend on cowardly little me!
