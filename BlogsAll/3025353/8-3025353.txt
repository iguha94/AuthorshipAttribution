"They haven't dug up any nerve gas canisters because they're too busy digging up bodies," my friend John explained to me.  A great retort, I have to admit.  (I can always count on John, whose antennae are particularly attuned to liberal hypocrisy and self-righteousness, to snap me back into line whenever I stray).  When we lament intelligence failures or outright lies that led up to the war against Iraq, aren't we in fact shedding tears for Saddam Hussein?  Some people can make this argument better than others.  If you were on the side of humanitarian interventions in the 1990s, then you can play that card.  Tom Friedman is a good example.  A liberal who's not reflexively against all Republican wars, Friedman supported the intervention in Kosovo and cautiously supported the war against Iraq, because it gave us an opportunity to bring democracy to a major Arab country.   But if you spent the last decade decrying "nation-building," then the fact that Saddam Hussein was an evil (that all-too-popular adjective) dictator ought to be of no consequence.  After all, you spent the last decade pointing out that the US can't be the world's policeman.  The world is full of thugs and dictators, you said.  We have to be pragmatic, you said, especially when the thugs rule a huge, emerging market, like China.  Limit military operations to the defense of vital US interests, you said.  Well, eight weeks after the fall of Baghdad, we still cannot find any weapons of mass destruction.  No threat to US vital interests.  If you're a foreign policy realist, you should be concerned.
