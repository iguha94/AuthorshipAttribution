I serve on our presbytery's Committee on Preparation for Ministry.  At our Wednesday meeting I had an exchange with a future minister that illustrates as well as anything what it means to be Presbyterian.    She was applying to become a Candidate, the second step along the road to ordination.  Her statement of faith contained staples of Reformed Theology such as--God loves us in spite of our unworthiness.  Knowing that this person was raised in a rather rigid Southern Baptist home, I said, "Baptists can talk about sin and grace too.  What about your understanding of sin and grace do you owe to your Baptist heritage, and what do you owe to your Presbyterian heritage?"  She replied, "It has everything to do with who makes the first move.  When I was a kid, it was beaten into my head, 'If you want a relationship with God, then you've got to take the first step.'  But I remember a severely and profoundly mentally disabled girl in a church service.  Everyone was saying the 'Sinner's Prayer,' except for her.  All she could make were bird sounds.  It dawned on me that, in God's eyes, I was she, and she was me, and if we have to make the first move with God, then nobody can be saved."  God makes the first move.  Or, in the words of Frederick Whitfield's camp meeting hymn, "O, how I love Jesus, because he first loved me."  Behind the severe Reformed doctrines of Original Sin, Total Depravity and Predestination is this Glad Tidings--God makes the first move.  That's what it means to be Presbyterian.
