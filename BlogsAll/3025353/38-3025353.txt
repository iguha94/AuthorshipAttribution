What are the spiders up to?   When I walked out this morning to get the paper there were spider webs everywhere.  Little pouches nestled in the grass, like whispy pita bread.  On the shrubs the spiders had spun balconies, flat webs extending out from branch to branch.  And there were the stereotypical big round ones.  I found a huge web in the church parking lot, anchored between the sidewalk and a maple branch at least six feet in the air.  By lunch the ones on the ground had disappeared, but I could still see webs in the bushes and trees.  There was fog this morning.  Perhaps the webs are always there, but the heavy dew and high humidity made them more visible.  Or maybe the spiders know that the hurricane is coming, and they are spreading their traps far and wide to collect any and all hapless bugs blown 250 miles inland.  My wife suggested that they're getting ready for winter.  Spinning, hunting, eating, adding fat, and the like.  I'm also wondering if the spiders, like Salisbury's Upper Crust who will soon open their mansions for the fall Home Tour, aren't simply showing off their commodious dwellings.  In  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , Harry and Ron, acting on the dubious advice of the terminated groundskeeper, Hagrid, follow a trail of spiders into the Forbidden Forest in order to solve the mystery of what's turning Hogwarts students into stone.  It's not pleasant what they find.  And if you've seen  The Two Towers  but haven't read The  Lord of the Rings  trilogy, you're wondering who the  SHE  is of whom Gollum speaks at the end of the movie.  You'll see her long, lean legs in  The Return of the King , all eight of them, but there'll be nothing arousing about it.  Arachnids don't frighten me.  I don't have a problem with snakes.  It's vermin like rats that give me the creeps.  But just to be on the safe side, I think I won't investigate any further the proliferation of spider webs in my own community.  Ignorance is bliss.
