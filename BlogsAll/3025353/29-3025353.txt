The kind of peace activist I don't want to be:  God-blogger   Telford Work  has called our attention to the   dispiriting story  of a peace group called Voices in the Wilderness.  The organization's goal was the lifting of  U.N. sanctions on Iraq.  Voices is a mostly Catholic group strongly influenced by the aggressive nonviolence of the Berrigan brothers.  These guys literally "beat swords into plowshares" by trespassing onto military bases and whacking fighter jets with hammers.  Voices members continued in that tradition with creative street protests, and traveling to Iraq with medical supplies in hand, in defiance of heavy federal penalties for visiting the pariah state.    According to the above link, the activists in Voices became mouthpieces for the regime of Saddam Hussein.  They never criticized the regime for its horrible human rights record.  There was only one problem in Iraq in the 1990s, they said, U.N. sanctions and U.S. foreign policy.  In the 1920s Lenin called Red-friendly folk in Europe "useful idiots."  I wouldn't go that far with Voices in the Wilderness.  I met the director, a woman named Kathy Kelly, at the 1998   Pax Christi  national conference.  She was in the middle of a twenty-one day fast for the lifting of the sanctions.  That's impressive.  The sanctions were harsh and did contribute to the deaths of Iraqi civilians, although the U.N. Oil for Food program did improve matters a bit.    But one can never evaluate any political conflict in black and white terms.  Beware of reductionisms on the left where everything that's wrong with the world is the fault of U.S. imperialism.  AND beware of all right wing reductionisms that would draw the line between good and evil where the Coalition of the Willing meets everyone else.  Activists of all stripes would profit from reading a little Karl Barth:       We reject the false doctrine, as though the church were permitted to abandon the form of its message and order to its own pleasure or to changes in prevailing ideological and political convictions.        We reject the false doctrine, as though the church in human arrogance could place the Word and work of the Lord in the service of any arbitrarily chosen desires, purposes or plans.   New Testament scholar   Ched Myers  has proposed that the pupose of the gospel of Mark was to create a Christian community of "radical nonalignment" during the time of the Jewish uprising of 70 AD.  Rejecting violence in the name of the cross of Jesus, Christians were suspect among both Jewish revolutionaries and the Roman authorities.  According to Myers, Jesus' statement "You will be hated by all on account of my name," is directed to the Christian situation in the generation after his death, as they were caught between the rock of imperialism and the hard place of violent revolution.  It's probably unfair to invoke Myers' name in criticizing Voices in the Wilderness, since both Myers and Voices founder Kathy Kelly were at that 1998 Pax Christi conference, and Myers had many complimentary things to say about Voices.  But "radical nonalignment" is where the church needs to be.  One need not become an apologist for dictators just because one is working against unjust dimensions of U.S. foreign policy, as was the case with Voices in the Wilderness.  At the same time, Christians must find ways to support our fellow human beings oppressed by dictatorial regimes without endorsing their violent overthrow at the hands of the U.S. military.
