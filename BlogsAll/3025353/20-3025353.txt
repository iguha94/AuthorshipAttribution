Last night I finally watched   The Chamber of Secrets , and this morning I finished   The Order of the Phoenix .  I'm liking the story more and more, and the movies less and less.  What's the matter with the movies?  The kids can't act.  Now, some of you will disagree.  Others will be offended, as if I've insulted Harry, Hermione and Ron themselves by criticizing the actors who play them.  I'm not, and even if I were, it's worth remembering that they're   fictional characters  , not your friends.  But I digress.  The kids can't act.  In the books, the dialogue snaps, crackles and pops.  In the movies, it falls flat.  Like soggy Rice Krispies.  I know that Hermione's supposed to be an egghead, but if you're playing her role, that doesn't mean delivering her lines as if you're reading from a script right in front of you.  At times, it's as if one actor is looking away from the script as the other one finishes a line.  The pickup is a half second off.  The kids also fail where there is no dialogue.  Frequently the movie introduces us muggle viewers to a new magical creature/spell/instrument by first showing us Harry's wordless reaction to it.  But Harry's face is a blank slate when it ought to be the picture of fear, delight or wonder.    Daniel Radcliffe's  not any relation to   Keanu Reeves , is he?  The adult actors are much better.  That guy who plays   Filch  is amazing.  He can communicate this absolutely horrible mixture of meanness and emotional instability simply by raising an eyebrow and setting his jaw a certain way.  Of course child actors aren't as skilled as their grownup colleagues.  They haven't the years of experience.  But the movies would have been better had talent rather than looks been the determining factor at the audition.
