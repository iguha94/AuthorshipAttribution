No reply so far from Christian Peacemaker Teams about what folks like you and me can do to advocate for   these Iraqi civilians  treated harshly by U.S. soldiers.  Maybe there's nothing we can do, or maybe the CPT email checker doesn't check email as religiously as I do.    Meanwhile, you ought to read   this New York Times article  on how the American counter-insurgency has stolen a page from the Israeli Army playbook.  U.S. soldiers have surrounded one Iraqi town with razor wire, forcing everyone to enter and leave the town through one U.S. manned checkpoint.  Residents have to produce IDs at the checkpoint, printed in ENGLISH.  Do these tactics work?  Since the U.S. stepped up its response to the rebellion, the average number of attacks per day have been cut in half.  On the other hand, the government whose occupation we're imitating has been in the West Bank and Gaza for 36 years, and has yet found the will or a graceful way to exit.    The Chief of Staff of the Israeli Army  recently commented on their operations in the Occupied Territories, saying, "In our tactical decisions, we are operating contrary to our strategic interests."  Does razor wire strung around Iraqi hamlets beget a peaceful and democratic Iraq?  Ask an Israeli in the know.  Remember again, Gentle Reader, back to January and February.  You were told Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, in violation of U.N. resolutions.  (Where are they?)  You were told that Iraqis would welcome us as liberators.  (Some welcome!)  You were told that Iraqi oil would pay the costs of reconstruction.  (Read the fine print:  Iraqi oil plus $87 billion of your taxes).  You were told that our troops would not be there very long after we declared victory.  (Korea, 50 years and counting.  Germany, 58 years and counting.  Israel in the Occupied Territories, 36 years and counting).    Tell me again why you're even thinking about re-electing this crew?
