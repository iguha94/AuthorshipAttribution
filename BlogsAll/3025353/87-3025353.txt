This morning's paper led off with the good news that   Libya has agreed to abandon  its chemical and nuclear weapons programs.  The Libyans initiated this process in March, when the War on Iraq began, prompting the White House to credit its doctrine of pre-emptive war for the Libyan turnaround.  Libya has been trying to change its spots for a while now.  After a decade of sanctions, the Libyans finally turned over the Pan Am 103 bombing suspects in the late 1990s.  I believe that was during the  Clinton  administration.  Yesterday's news is another welcome step in the right direction.  If the war on Iraq hurried them along, then it's fine with me if President Bush wants to take the credit, though anyone with a good memory wouldn't give him all the credit.  And I think that's awfully big of me considering the fact that no Republican I know will give President Clinton credit for anything good that happened while he was in the White House.  And a lot of good things happened in the 1990s.  Lots of jobs.  A surging stock market.  A balanced budget.  Etc, etc.    In fact, I'll give the President all the credit for Libyan disarmament as long as the President's willing to take all the blame for North Korea being a nuclear power today.  Let's shake on it.  Related question:  why is Colonel Gadhafi still only a Colonel?  He's ruled Libya since 1969--that's as long as I've been alive.  Shouldn't he be Marshall Gadhafi by now?  General Gadhafi?  Supreme Commander Gadhafi?
