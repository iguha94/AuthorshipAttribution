With the Roadmap to Peace blown to smithereens , let me put in my two-cents-worth about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  As Rabbi Michael Lerner of   Tikkun magazine  has pointed out, the current approaches to peacemaking are doomed to fail because they all make a cease fire the  first step.  This puts any peace process at the mercy of the extremists.  Rather than starting with a cease fire, begin at the end.  Put the final outcome on the table, so that moderates on both sides can point to real gains right off the bat.  Lerner's magazine has done just that.    Click here for their Resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .  A summary:  Israel would return to its 1967 borders, with a nip and tuck here and there to retain control of the Western Wall and Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem.  Some Palestinian refugees would be allowed to return to their ancestral homes in Israel-proper, and the rest compensated by an international relief fund.  A new State of Palestine would recognize human rights.  The Tikkun proposal is not too different from the agreement that the Barak government reached with the Palestinian Authority shortly before the January, 2001 elections that swept Ariel Sharon into power.  The fall of the Labor government and a new round of violence scuttled the plan.  Can that old plan be the basis for a fresh start toward peace?  Not likely unless the U.S. government puts new pressure on the Israelis.  But that would mean the Bush administration risking alienating its fundamentalist Christian base, which believes that the modern state of Israel can do no wrong because it is the lynchpin of end times prophecy.  Would that "Blessed are the peacemakers" carried as much weight with them as bizarre interpretations of Revelation.
