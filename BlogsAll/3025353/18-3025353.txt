A friend's generosity has put me in an ethical quandry.  She wants to give me her old lawnmover, an eco-friendly, rechargeable, electric mower.  The problem is that I've already got an eco-friendly mower, the friendliest of them all--a reel mower that runs on Marvin power.  I'm tempted to accept the gift.  With the reel mower I must cut the grass twice a week, especially when it's wet (and boy has it been wet this year!)  My kind of mower simply can't catch tall grass between its teeth.  The electric mower, like its gas-powered cousin, can whack back even the tallest grass with its motorized blade.  It would be nice to mow only one day out of seven.  So what's the hang-up?  The electric mower does rely on power generated by the burning of fossil fuels.  They're burned in power plants which are cleaner than gas-powered movers belching blue smoke, but still, some environmental damage is being done.  Nevertheless, I will probably give the forlorn electric mower a home.  It's too convenient to pass up.  I'm sliding fast down that slippery slope.  I used to be a vegetarian; now I eat fish occasionally.  (I need those Omega 3 fatty acids, I rationalize to myself.)  Now I'm going to soil my hands with a polluting lawn-care device.  I hope y'all will still talk to me in a few years when I've hit bottom, stuffing a Big Mac in my mouth while the Husqvarna underneath me feasts on a third of an acre of lush, green ChemLawn fescue.
