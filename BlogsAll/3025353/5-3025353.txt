Are wizards Carolina fans or State fans?  It's impossible to say for sure, but the Hogwarts curriculum does give us some clues.  Harry, Ron and Hermione's course work seems to come straight out of a land grant university's parallel universe.  They study animal science (Care of Magical Creatures with Hagrid), chemistry (Potions with Snape), and astronomy (Professor Trelawney's Divination class gives them a thorough grounding in astrology).  Hogwarts does not neglect the humanities entirely.  The History of Magic is a required course.  Alas, this worthy subject (the one in which I majored at N.C. State) is taught by a professor almost as boring as the history teacher Ben Stein played in  Ferris Bueller's Day Off .  Professor Binns also happens to be a ghost (what better creature to teach history?)  Aspiring wizards must also complete many writing assignments, but the writing is more technical than creative.  For instance, one might have to turn in two parchments on which spells ought not be mixed together on a particular subject at the same time.  So picture 15 or so young adult muggles in the parking lot of Carter-Finley stadium peering into telescopes.  Astronomy lab at NC State, in other words.  I'm not saying that these 15 are any more likely to discern a portent of disaster in the heavens than the muggles who attend that little liberal arts insitution 27 miles up highway 54.  Nor is it the case that if they looked to the east, they'd see unicorns prancing in the pasture surrounding the vet school.  But if Hogwarts ever decides to admit muggles (and today's Supreme Court ruling may force them to), it's clear where Professor Dumbledore ought to recruit.
