I'm almost ready to go on vacation.  We hate leaving a messy house, so Laura vacuumed and cleaned the bathrooms.  I straightened up the garden.  Out with the kale, lettuce and peas (and weeds).  In with the okra.    A sparkling countertop.  A freshly vacuumed carpet, fibers all lying in the same direction.  Freshly turned soil with nary a dandelion or stubborn piece of crabgrass.  All three are immensely satisfying.  Ethan, of his own volition, offered to help by hoeing around the squash.  He's becoming quite the gardener.  The other day I took him with me to the nursery.  The idea was nothing more than to give Laura a break; plus, I had just weeded a spot next to the wall, under the rose-of-sharon.  What it needed was a few impatiens.  But Ethan had his own ideas.  Some pink petunias caught his eye.  He insisted that we buy them.  So we added them to the purple impatiens I had selected.  We found a good location for them, a sunny, empty patch of dirt next to the corner of the house.  He dig the holes and planted the petunias.  That night we said prayers.  Ethan prayed for the petunias.  "God, please give my flowers lots of sun, and lots of rain, and make the rain good, clean water."  Thursday and Friday were sunny, and today's been a washout.  Who says that God doesn't answer prayers?  Ethan doesn't know the song, but he does know that "His eye is on the sparrow."
