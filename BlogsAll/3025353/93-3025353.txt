Saddam Hussein emerged from his hole   looking a lot  like an alcoholic veteran who visited us regularly when Laura and I lived in the manse next to the church.  "Well, he has been homeless since March," my wife reminded me.  True.  This morning's worship was our annual service of lessons and carols.  The   reading from Isaiah  lept out at me:   Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end .  "His" being the Messiah, Jesus.  I'm not in favor of theocracy, either the Taliban flavor, or the "good ol' days" flavor when churches in America were full.  Christendom, those in the know call it.  Isaiah's words are being fulfilled in the evangelization of the world, as those who confess Jesus Christ to be their Lord and Savior "increase."  We live as   resident aliens , under the authority of temporal governments, yet always remembering that "our citizenship is in heaven."  Our ultimate loyalty is to Christ.  Nonetheless, the relative justice and peace that secular governments impose is of concern to Christians.  "Seek the welfare of the city that the Lord is sending you," the prophet Jeremiah charged his fellow Jews as the Babylonians marched them off into exile.  We don't demand that the state use force to impose the gospel of love on its citizens, but just as yeast causes bread to rise, Christian communities can have a leavening effect on the wider society.  As Afghans meet this weekend to establish a new constitution, and as the capture of Saddam Hussein closes forever an ugly chapter in the history of Iraq, how can those of us whose ultimate loyalty is Jesus Christ cause justice and righteousness to spring up in those two countries?
