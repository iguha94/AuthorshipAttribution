All day I've been thinking about a story from the gospels to which I alluded in my Christmas Eve sermon:     One day he got into a boat with the disciples, and he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side of the lake."  So they put out, and while they were sailing he fell asleep.  A windstorm swept down on the lake, and the boat was filling with water, and they were in danger.  They went to him and woke him up, shouting, "Master, Master, we are perishing!"  And he woke up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; they ceased, and there was a calm.  He said to them, "Where is your faith?"  They were afraid and amazed, and said to one another, "Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"    (Luke 8:  22-25)    Note that while Jesus solves the problem at hand the disciples remain an emotional basket case.  The storm terrifies them, but the One who can deliver them safe and sound to the other shore terrifies them too.  So why'd they wake him up?  Clearly they didn't expect him to do anything about their predicament, or else they'd be giving him high-fives instead of huddling at the other end of the boat muttering amongst themselves. They thought that they were going to die, and they wanted to sink into the waves accusing the one who'd gotten them into this jam.    So typical.  We'd rather have something to complain about than actually have our problem solved.  For if our cancer were cured, our unhealthy relationships straightened out, our nation at peace with other nations, etc. etc.; then we'd have to deal with a force more powerful than cancer, terrorism or dysfunctional behavior.  They devil you know is always preferable to the devil you don't know, even when that devil isâ€¦ Jesus.
