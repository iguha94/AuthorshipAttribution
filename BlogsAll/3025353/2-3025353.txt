My former hometown, Sweet Springs, Missouri , has made the international press.  When we lived there in the mid-90s, we'd often see a disabled man zipping down the sidewalk in a motorized wheelchair.  Since we moved, the man graduated to a golf cart.    Now that golf cart is at the eye of a hurricane of small town controversy.  It seems that the local police chief ordered the man to drive his golf cart home, or else he'd be cited.  The police chief maintains that a recent change in state law prohibits driving golf carts on public roads.  Not according to the state attorney general's office, which responded to querries by the local newspaper editor about whether or not golf cart are considered vehicles under Missouri law.  The editor of the  Sweet Springs Herald , and many "concerned citizens," have been sharply critical of the police chief, but to date he has the backing of the mayor and the city council.  (Full disclosure--my wife is a former employee of the  Sweet Springs Herald ).  Both   CNN  and   The Guardian , a British newspaper, have run stories about the Sweet Springs golf cart controversy.  I think that this is the most publicity for this part of the world since neighboring Green Ridge, Missouri was nuked in the 1983 movie "The Day After."  I wonder if the Soviets cried "Fore!" before they let that particular missile rip.
