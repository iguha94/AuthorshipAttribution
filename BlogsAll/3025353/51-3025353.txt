I haven't followed the Salisbury City Council race very closely, but after reading   today's Post  I can only say, My loss!  What scintilating political debate I've missed out on!  What erudite ideas for our community's well being have been uttered, and I have deprived myself of the opportunity to ruminate upon them!   Take this one from candidate Bob Boone:  Salisbury's problem is that it doesn't have its own identity.  The solution?  Get our own area code, a different one than Charlotte.  The man is thinking big.  Why, as soon as that plank on Mr. Boone's platform is established, we'll have to dial ELEVEN numbers to reach Charlotte, unlike those chumps in China Grove who only have to dial ten.  Now that's really distinguishing yourself from the rest of the pack.  I see even bigger and better things in store for Salisbury during "the Boone years," as we'll look back on them and call them.  Like getting a brand new zip code too.  I favor the first three characters being SP1.  That would cement our relationship with our sister city, Salisbury, England, whose postal code also begins with SP1 or SP2.  Plus, we'll be the only place in the U.S. with letters in our zip code.  You couldn't get more different than if the entire city council pierced their tongues!  Seriously (somewhat), my wife did point out one advantage to a new area code.  If Salisbury ever has a Reuben Studdard-like star on American Idol, he/she can make our area code famous.  And we won't have to share the glory with Gastonia.
