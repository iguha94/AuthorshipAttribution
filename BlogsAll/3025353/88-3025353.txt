I have a terrible secret of which I must unburden myself.  You, Dear Reader, may never again darken the virtual door of this weblog after getting a load of this.  Yours truly is on the verge of descending to the ninth level of geekdom hell.  That's right.  I'm thinking about PLAYING D&D.    It's been a long time coming. I was on the debate team in high school.  I've read Tolkien's trilogy twice, and I've picked up The Hobbit for a third time.  I've attended two Ren Fairs now, and I even went to one in costume.    Moreover, I don't keep the kind of company that could be depended upon to maintain the sliver of cool quotient I have left.  My wife watched all three Rings movies back-to-back-to-back this past Tuesday.  She also has some friends who are, O dear, how can I go on?  Well, I must tell all.  She has some friends who are THEATRE PEOPLE.    So now I find myself in possession of the latest edition of the AD&D Player's Manual.  But we need a DM.  That's a "Dungeon Master" for the uninitiated.  D&D, you see, is a role playing game.  You pretend that you're a swashbuckling knight, an elven wizard or whatever, in search of treasure, fame, glory.  The DM is to the game what a director is to the play.  He/she orchestrates the adventure.    I emailed the operator of a message board for role playing game enthusiasts in the Charlotte region.  He said, "Be careful.  Your enjoyment of the game depends entirely on finding the right DM."  Now I'm all nervous about posting an email on the message board requesting a DM.  It's like I'm creating an ad for some dating service:     WM, 34, ISO DM, 28-45, for weekend fantasy.     Hmm.  It needs some workâ€¦
