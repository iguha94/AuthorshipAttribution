On this day after election day,   you might want to click here, take this test,  and find out what your political type is.  Rather than locating you on a left-right contiuum, this quiz plots you somewhere on a grid.  The left-right axis measures your economic ideas, and the up-down axis measures your preferred degree of state power (authoritarian versus libertarian).  The inventors of this test say that the old left-right scale is inadequate.  How can you explain the fact that the "far right" Robert Novak and the "far left" Michael Moore both opposed the Iraq War?  Or, who's farther to the left, Gandhi or Stalin?  What's needed is a two-dimensional system of political categories.  I wound up in the lower left quadrant, Liberal Libertarian, somewhere between (ha, ha) Nelson Mandela and Jean Cretien.    Some of the questions are a little tricky, and if you want to take the test, perhaps you shouldn't read my comments.  One was, "The freer the market, the freer the people."  Agree or disagree?  Well, if the choice is between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, I agree.  But if it's between the U.S. and present-day Albania, where there is no state regulation of commerce, no transparancy, no rule of law other than the law of the capitalist jungle, I'd have to disagree.    My slate took all five seats  on the Salisbury City Council.  I hardly ever vote for the winner in an election.  Just what crazy kind of town do I live in?  Yesterday's vote is a victory for historic preservation, downtown development, good race relations, and an overall sound quailty of life for this community.  I'm pleased.
