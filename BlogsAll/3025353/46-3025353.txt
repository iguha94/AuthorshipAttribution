The Passion , Part Two:   More speculation on what I've heard, and not seen.   The Passion  is reputed to do for Good Friday what  Saving Private Ryan  did for D-Day--shock the viewer with a graphic depiction of the gruesome violence of that last day in Jesus's life.  This concerns me more than the reports that  The Passion  may be anti-semitic.    The Jesuit theologian Jon Sobrino has complained that Christianity has morphed into a cult of suffering rather than maintaining itself as a cult of those who follow Jesus.  If  The Passion  gives us no context for the gory end of Jesus's life--his associations with social outcasts, his teaching that one should love one's enemies, his civil disobedience in the temple which sealed his fate--then the (Christian) viewer will be left with gratitude that Christ suffered so much for his/her sins, but will miss the fact that Christ has bequethed to his followers a lifestyle of resistance to evil that may lead to a similar end.  Will  The Passion  give us a Jesus who was "born to die," so to speak, or will it give us a Jesus who died as the result of the life he lived, a life that was sharply critical of the religious vision of the leaders of his time?  If the latter, will  The Passion  help us make connections to our current context?  WWJD, for instance, in the temples of contemporary American religion?  Who are the outcasts that Jesus would be-friend today?  And who is Caiaphas today?  Jerry Fallwell?  Jesse Jackson?
