Online music swapping has been killing the recording industry.   A couple of years ago they successfully sued Napster, the internet file-sharing company, for facilitating copyright infringment.  That didn't stop the free distribution of music over the internet.  Like blowing the head off a dandelion, new software and new techniques sprouted to replace Napster.   So now they're suing the little guys.  Literally.  This week, a bunch of 12 to 15 year olds got   served papers  for illegally distributing copyrighted music.    Bullies.  It's not enough that Big Media wants to choose your musical taste for you--Just try finding any truly interesting music on your radio dial.  The classic rock stations haven't changed their playlists in 15 years.  The pop stations stick strictly to bubblegum or hip-hop, most of which is is rapping over samples ripped from the classic rock playlist).    Big Media also wants you to pay through the nose for their unoriginal music.  A CD costs $1 to make, but retails for $18.  If record companies are in a huff over file sharing, it's their own fault.  Ask any economist:  when you set the price too high, you create a black market for your good or service.  I don't do file sharing because this blog is about all that I want to learn how to do on the internet.  Plus, I'm operating a Pentium 133, a hand-me-down from my brother-in-law's wife.  No place to store those MP3 files.  Nor do I buy CDs.  Can't afford them, and even if I could, I won't be extorted.  I listen to the music I like   here , and   here .  No triple-sets of Skynard, and no Britney.  Problem is, I'm still doing dial up, so I can't listen and receive phone calls.  I'll soon invest in a cable or DSL line--not more CDs--and tap a variety of sounds out there, all for free, and much better quailty than what Big Media's promoting on Clear Channel.
