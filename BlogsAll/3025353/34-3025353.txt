What can Democrats running for President learn from yesterday's Republican City Council primary in Charlotte?  Races are won or lost on the future, not the past.  Mayor Pat McCrory and Councilwoman Lynn Wheeler faced primary challenges because they pushed through a new, publically financed basketball arena after voters regected the concept in a non-binding referendum a couple of years ago.  Grumpy, anti-tax, anti-everything Charlotte Republicans bet that resentment over the arena would propel them to the top of the ticket in the fall elections.    It wasn't to be.  McCrory cruised, winning better than 60% of the vote.  Wheeler lost, but as today's   Charlotte Observer notes , she spent little of her hundred grand war chest in the primary.  Wheeler's own laziness seems to have cost her another tern, not any anti-arena backlash.  In short, the arena's a done deal.  Voters accepted this, and that meant that the far right candidates got nowhere yesterday.  This cools me a little on Howard Dean's prospects against President Bush.  Dean delights in bashing the administration on bungling the occupation.  He loves to point out the lies that the administration told to justify the war.  Yet the war happened.  I imagine that voters in November of 2004 will not be voting for or against a war that's already been waged, but for the candidate who has the best plan to manage the occupation come January, 2005.  There is "a time to break down and a time to build up" (Ecclesiastes 3: 3).  The time is coming for Dean and other Democrats to tell us their plan for building up Iraq.
